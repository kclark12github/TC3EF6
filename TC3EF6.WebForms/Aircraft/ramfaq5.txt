Subject:  H.9.  British aircraft designations
Updated 1998-04-25

Unlike the US system, the proper name is the principal part of an
aircraft's formal designation in British service.  The full designation
consists of the name, a letter or set of letters indicating the role, and a
mark number; in a few cases the mark number is followed by a letter
indicating a modification.  The full designation is written as, for
example, "Tornado GR.1A", or sometimes "Tornado GR Mk 1A" 
and formally "Tornado Mark 1 Mod. A" (the Tornado GR.1 is the ground 
attack/reconnaissance version of the Tornado; the GR.1A is a
variant in which one of the two guns is replaced by reconnaissance gear).

For export versions, the role letters are usually left out, and the mark
numbers are restarted from a high number, usually 50 (for example, the
Indian Navy's Sea Harriers are Mk 51).

Before WW2, mark numbers alone were used, and were written in Roman
numerals; during the war, the role letters were added, and conventional
numerals were used for mark numbers above 20.  The Roman numerals were
dropped altogether after the war; apart from that, the system has remained
largely unchanged.

Role letters (the current system):

A   -   Attack                  (Indicates a tactical attack aircraft without
                                 nuclear capability)
AEW -   Airborne Early Warning
B   -   Bomber                  (Heavy bomber. None in service)
C   -   Cargo
F   -   Fighter                 (Air to air)
G   -   Ground Attack   
K   -   Tanker
R   -   Recce
S   -   Strike                  (As `A', above, but implies nuclear capability)
T   -   Trainer
W   -   Weather Recce.          (An oddball, there's only one.)

Prefix letters:

M   -   Maritime
N   -   Night
P   -   Photographic

Helicopters start with an H, then

AR  -   Air Rescue
AS  -   Anti Submarine (not obsolete, Sea Kings and Lynx are still HAS.x)
C   -   Cargo
T   -   Trainer
MA  -   Maritime Attack (e.g. Lynx HMA Mark 8)
M   -   Maritime (e.g. Merlin HM Mark 1)

The Army Air Corps being different use `AH' with no postfix.

Subject:  H.10.  Canadian aircraft designations

The Canadian designation system is based on a simplified version of the
American system.  A designation consists of the letter "C" (for Canadian),
a letter to indicate the aircraft's role, a dash, and a number, sometimes
followed by a letter to indicate a modification; usually "A" for a modified
version, or "D" for a dual-control trainer.  Sometimes the aircraft's
original designation in its country of origin is used, with some
modification; for example, the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, in Canadian
service, is known as the CC-130, versions being CC-130E (C-130E) and
CC-130H (C-130H) transports and CC-130NT navigational trainers.

The numbers are assigned in a single sequence for all types in Canadian
service, are always over 100, are not reused and when you list them they're
sorted by number rather than alphabetically.
This has led to a few aircraft having a real designation that differs from the 
one they're commonly known by; for example, the F-5 and F/A-18 in Canadian 
service are usually referred to as the CF-5 and CF-18, but the correct 
designations are CF-116 and CF-188, respectively.

Role letters:

    C = Cargo transport
    E = Electronics
    F = Fighter
    H = Helicopter
    P = Maritime patrol
    T = Trainer

Several exist that aren't in current use:

    SR = Search and Rescue as in CSR-123 Otter  and CSR-110 Albatross
    O = Observation as in CO-119 L-19A/Ceesna L182
    X = Experimental as in CX-131/CX-84 Dynavert

There are several other official role desigantors that have never been used
(like A, B, K, R, S, U, V).

"The Aircraft of the Canadian Armed Forces: A Checklist of Current Aircraft and
Disposals" was published in 1995 in short paperback form by
SIRIUS Productions <sirius@wwdc.com>, and work is underway (May 1997) on an
expanded and revised edition. 
The authors, Jeff Rankin-Lowe and Andrew Cline, have done a lot of detailed
research on CAF serials and designations.

Subject:  H.11.  Chinese aircraft designations

Chinese aircraft use a fairly simple system consisting of a letter or
letters to indicate the role, a dash, and a number, sometimes followed by
additional letters or numbers to indicate subtypes.  The role letters are
often replaced by their English equivalents for export versions (for
example, the export version of the Q-5 (Qiang = Attack) is the A-5).

The numeric sequences always start with 5.  Oddly enough for one of the
last bastions of Communism, this is the result of superstition; 4 is
considered an unlucky number in China (because the Chinese words for "four"
and "death" are very similar).  The designation "J-2", often quoted for the
licence-built MiG-15, is mythical; the Chinese aircraft have always been
known simply as MiG-15, even after the Chinese and Russian governments
parted ways.

Role letters:

    CJ (export PT) = Chujiao (basic trainer)
    H  (export B)  = Hong (bomber)
    J  (export F)  = Jian (fighter)
    JJ (export FT) = Jianjiao (fighter trainer)
    Q  (export A)  = Qiang (attack)
    SH (export PS) = Shuihong (maritime bomber)
    Y              = Yun (transport)
    Z              = Zhi (vertical, i.e.  helicopter)

Many Russian, and more recently Western, aircraft have been manufactured in
China and given Chinese designations.  These include:

    CJ-5 = Yakovlev Yak-18 "Max"
    H-5  = Ilyushin Il-28 "Beagle"
    H-6  = Tupolev Tu-16 "Badger"
    J-5  = Mikoyan MiG-17 "Fresco"
    J-6  = Mikoyan MiG-19 "Farmer"
    J-7  = Mikoyan MiG-21 "Fishbed"
    JJ-7 = Mikoyan MiG-21U "Mongol" (but see below)
    Y-5  = Antonov An-2 "Colt"
    Y-7  = Antonov An-24/26 "Coke/Curl"
    Y-8  = Antonov An-12 "Cub"
    Z-5  = Mil Mi-4 "Hare"
    Z-6  = Mil Mi-8 "Hip"
    Z-8  = Aérospatiale AS.321 Super Frelon
    Z-9  = Aérospatiale AS.365 Dauphin 2

Training versions of the J-5 and J-6 were built (JJ-5 and JJ-6); these had
no Russian counterparts (there was no MiG-17U or MiG-19U).  Equating the
JJ-7 to the MiG-21U in the list above is slightly misleading, since the
trainer version was developed independently, not based on the Russian
trainer.

Indigenous Chinese fighter designs have gone up to at least J-12.  The J-8
has entered service (see B.13).  The J-9 was cancelled about 1978, with no
examples built; the J-7III and J-8II were developed partly as replacements
for it.  The J-10 is a current project, started in the late 1980s, and
expected to enter service before the end of this decade.  The J-11
designation has not been used.  The J-12 was built (one or two prototypes
only) in Nanchang during the 1970s (the number seems to have been used out
of sequence for some reason), in competition with the J-7 and J-8; it
resembled a scaled-up MiG-15/17, and was cancelled because of its poor
weapon system.

It has recently been reported that China and Israel are collaborating on a
new fighter based on Israel's abandoned Lavi project (J-11?).

Two Chinese aircraft have been given NATO codenames:  J-8 "Finback" and Q-5
"Fantan".

Subject:  H.12.  German aircraft designations (WW2)

German aircraft were identified by two letters denoting the manufacturing
company, a number denoting the aircraft type (separated from the letters by
a space), and various modifiers for subtypes.

Manufacturer codes:

    Arado          = Ar
    Bücker         = Bü
    Bachem         = Ba
    Blohm und Voss = Bv, Ha
    Dornier        = Do
    Fieseler       = Fi
    Flettner       = Fl
    Focke-Achgelis = Fa
    Focke-Wulf     = Fw, Ta
    Gotha          = Go
    Heinkel        = He
    Henschel       = Hs
    Horten         = Ho
    Junkers        = Ju
    Messerschmitt  = Bf, Me

"Bf" for Messerschmitt came from Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, the company's
name before Willy Messerschmitt took over.  "Ha" for Blohm und Voss came
from Hamburger Flugzeugbau, the name of the aircraft division of the Blohm
und Voss shipbuilding company.  "Ta" for Focke-Wulf was used in honour of
designer Kurt Tank.

Type numbers were assigned by the RLM (air ministry); a single sequence was
used for all manufacturers.  Related types were often given numbers
differing by 100; for example, the Messerschmitt Me 210 was designed as a
replacement for the Bf 110, and was developed into the Me 310 (abandoned
before flight) and Me 410.

Prototype aircraft had a "V" followed by a number identifying individual
aircraft, separated from the main designation by a space (e.g.  Me 262 V1).
Major variants were denoted by a letter immediately following the type
number (e.g.  Me 262A), minor variants by a number separated from the major
variant letter by a dash (e.g.  Me 262A-1).  Pre-production aircraft had a
zero in this position (e.g.  Me 262A-0).  Further variations on a subtype
could be denoted by a lower case letter attached to the variant number
(e.g.  Me 262A-1a).  Modified aircraft were indicated by "/R" or "/U" and a
number (e.g.  Me 262A-1a/U5), or by "/Trop" (which I assume indicated a
tropical climate adaptation).

Subject:  H.13.  Japanese aircraft designations and codenames (WW2)

Japanese aircraft designations are a highly confusing subject, since four
different systems were in use simultaneously in Japan, in addition to the
codenames used by the Allies.  The Japanese Army and Navy each used two
systems to identify the same aircraft, so a type used by both services
(there were a few) could have up to five different designations -- Japanese
Army Kitai number, Army type number, Navy designation code, Navy type
number, and Allied codename!

Just to confuse matters a bit further, a few types were known best by
nicknames that had no official status.  The Mitsubishi A6M fighter, also
known as the Carrier-Borne Fighter Type 0, had the official Allied codename
of "Zeke"; but it went down in history under the unofficial nickname used
by both sides:  "Zero".

The Japanese Army Air Force identified aircraft by "Kitai" (airframe)
numbers, which simply consisted of "Ki", a dash, and a number.  Originally
the numbers were a simple numeric sequence; later, some randomisation was
added, as a security measure.  Gliders received "Ku" ("Guraida") numbers
instead.  Subtypes or variants were indicated by Roman numeral suffixes, or
by various Japanese abbreviations (a common one was "Kai" (for "Kaizo"),
indicating a major modification).

In addition to Kitai numbers, most Army aircraft also received a second
designation in a parallel system based on role and the year of entry into
service.  Originally this was the last two digits of the year; 100 was used
for the Japanese year 2600 (1940), then the numbers were restarted from 1.

Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft received a designation code very similar to
those used by the US Navy.  This consisted of a letter to indicate the
aircraft's function, a sequential number to indicate a specific aircraft
type (unlike the USN system, the number 1 was left in), and a letter to
indicate the manufacturing company.  This was followed by a dash and a
number to indicate a subtype, plus an optional letter or letters for
further variations.

Function letters:

    A = Carrier-borne fighter
    B = Carrier-borne torpedo bomber
    C = Carrier-borne reconnaissance
    D = Carrier-borne dive bomber
    E = Reconnaissance seaplane
    F = Observation seaplane
    G = Land-based bomber
    H = Flying-boat
    J = Land-based fighter
    K = Trainer
    L = Transport
    M = Special-purpose seaplane
    N = Fighter seaplane
    P = Bomber
    Q = Patrol
    R = Land-based reconnaissance
    S = Night fighter

Some manufacturer letters:

    A = Aichi
    D = Showa
    K = Kawanishi
    M = Mitsubishi
    N = Nakajima
    P = Nihon
    V = Seversky
    W = Kyushu, Watanabe
    Y = Yokosuka

The IJN also used a parallel system based on role description and year
number, similar to (but independent of) the Army's, except that the year
2600 (1940) became 0 instead of 100.  This system was abandoned in 1943,
when it was decided that revealing the year of an aircraft's entry into
service might give useful information to the enemy.  Aircraft were then
given proper names instead.

Because the correct designations of Japanese aircraft were often not known
(and, as you've probably gathered by now, difficult to keep straight
anyway), the Allies assigned codenames to them. The basic rules for these,
not always followed, were:

    Bombers, dive bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, seaplanes, torpedo
        bombers -- Girls' names
    Fighters, reconnaissance seaplanes -- Boys' names
    Gliders -- Names of birds
    Trainers -- Names of trees
    Transport aircraft -- Girls' names beginning with "T"

The following list gives various designations for some of the more
important Japanese aircraft of WW2:

  Aichi D3A                 = Navy Type 99 Carrier-Borne Fighter    = "Val"

Subject:  H.14.  Swedish aircraft designations
Updated 1999 Dec 24

The aircraft designations used by the Swedish armed forces consist of a set
of letters to indicate the role, and a number to indicate an aircraft type,
with a space between them.  A letter may be added after the number to
indicate subtypes.

The numbers are assigned in a single sequence for all types of aircraft.
(Before about 1940, there were different number series depending on role.)
The same number is always used for the same basic aircraft type, but the
prefix may be changed to indicate different roles.

Role codes (these may be combined, e.g. "JA" for fighter/attack,
the secondary role being added to the left of the primary, if 
the roles can be said to be primary or secondary):

    A   = Attack
    B   = Bomb
    Fpl = Flygplan (aeroplane; used for multirole light aircraft)
    Hkp = Helikopter
    J   = Jakt (fighter)
    S   = Spaning (reconnaissance)
    SF  = Spaning foto (photographic reconnaissance)
    SH  = Spaning havsövervakning (maritime reconnaissance)
    Sk  = Skol (trainer)
    T   = Torped (torpedo bomber) (obsolete)
    Tp  = Transport

The following types are currently in Swedish service:

    Hkp 3                 = Agusta/Bell AB-204 Iroquois
    Hkp 4                 = Boeing/Kawasaki KV-107 Sea Knight
    Hkp 5B                = Schweizer 300
    Hkp 6                 = Agusta/Bell AB-206 Jetranger
    Hkp 9                 = MBB BO 105
    Hkp 10                = Eurocopter AS.332 Super Puma
    Hkp 11                = Augusta AB-412
    JA/AJS/SK 37          = Saab Viggen
    JAS 39                = Saab Gripen
    Tp 54                 = Piper PA-31 Navajo
    Sk 60                 = Saab 105
    Fpl/Sk 61             = BAe Bulldog
    Tp 84                 = Lockheed C-130 Hercules
    Tp 86                 = Rockwell Sabreliner
    Tp 88                 = Fairchild Metro
