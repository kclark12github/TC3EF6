Subject:  A.1.  Introduction

Every newsgroup on Usenet finds that certain questions crop up time after
time.  Regular readers of a group get tired of seeing the same old
questions (and posting the same old answers) time and time again, while new
readers wonder why they're getting so many impolite replies, and so few
useful ones, to perfectly reasonable queries.  The result is frustration
all round.

This list of Frequently Asked Questions attempts to provide answers to some
of the most popular questions about military aircraft and aviation.  It
will be posted to "rec.aviation.military" every month.  If you're fairly
new to this group (or even if you're not) and have a question related to
military aviation, you should check here first, to avoid wasting bandwidth
on a topic that may have already been discussed many times.  Of course,
this is not intended to discourage interesting discussions; if you have
something new to say about any of the topics covered here (or any other
topic, for that matter), by all means share it with us.

Further contributions are welcome; send any comments, corrections, new
questions, or new answers to me at the address above (note that the address
for FAQ-related mail is different from my normal address).  If you send me
mail about the FAQ, please reduce any quoted material to the absolute
minimum (ideally, just give the number of the question and answer you're
talking about).

Subject:  A.3.  A note on character sets

A FAQ on a subject like this will necessarily include a lot of non-English
names and words which contain letters not in the English alphabet, mainly
accented vowels.  I don't like the idea of forcing foreign words into an
English straitjacket by converting these letters into diphthongs (or, even
worse, just ignoring the accents).  There is an international standard
8-bit character set, ISO 8859/1, also known as Latin 1; it's an extension
of 7-bit ASCII to include most of the characters used in European
languages.  I've used the Latin 1 characters in this document.

A lot of news transport and news reading software now supports Latin 1, and
it's becoming more widely supported; unfortunately, there's still a lot of
software around that reduces everything to 7-bit ASCII.  For the benefit of
those using such software, here's a table of the accented letters in Latin
1 (not all of these appear in this document, of course), so you can tell
whether you have 8-bit software, and if not, which characters the accented
letters are being turned into.  If you come across a name that seems to be
spelled oddly, this should help you figure out what it's meant to be.

    Letter           A a E e I i N n O o U u Y y
    Acute accent (') Á á É é Í í - - Ó ó Ú ú Ý ý
    Grave accent (`) À à È è Ì ì - - Ò ò Ù ù - -

Subject:  B.1.  A/F-X

The A/F-X (Attack/Fighter X) was a joint USAF/USN project to produce a
heavy attack aircraft with a secondary fighter role; it would have replaced
the F-111 and A-6 in the attack role, and (partially) the F-14 in the
fighter role.  It was a short-lived programme, originating in 1991 after
the cancellation of the McDonnell Douglas/General Dynamics A-12, a highly
advanced, highly stealthy aircraft intended to replace the A-6.  A new
programme, originally designated A-X, was initiated to provide a cheaper
A-6 replacement.  At the same time, the NATF (Naval Advanced Tactical
Fighter) programme, intended to produce an F-14 replacement, had recently
been put on hold, and the USAF was starting to think seriously about an
F-111 replacement.  The three programmes were merged under the title A/F-X.

The leading contender was the Lockheed/Boeing AFX-653, essentially a
navalised version of the USAF's F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighter (see below).
This would have been a two-seat aircraft with Tomcat-like swing wings, but
otherwise similar to the F-22.  The A/F-X project was cancelled at the end
of 1993; the US Navy intends to procure the F/A-18E/F series as partial
replacements for its aircraft.  Lockheed and Boeing are still working on
the AFX-653, and hope to offer a further developed version for a future
project (but probably not JAST (see below), for which the AFX-653 would
probably be too big).

You can find an article on the subject, with plans of the AFX-653, in the
26-Jan-94 issue of _Flight International_.

Vital statistics (AFX-653):  power plant:  two 113 kN Pratt & Whitney
PW7000 augmented turbofans; armament:  one 20mm cannon, internal bays for
various air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons, including AGM-86E missiles
and GBU-24 guided bombs.

Subject:  B.2.  Bell/Boeing V-22 Osprey

The tilt-rotor programme began with Bell's XV-15 technology demonstrator.
A tilt-rotor multimission aircraft was commissioned under the title JVX
(Joint VTOL X); the aircraft, developed jointly by Bell Helicopter Textron
and Boeing Vertol, was later designated V-22 Osprey.  The first prototype
flew on 19 March 1989; development has been interrupted by the destruction
of two of the prototypes in crashes.

Despite attempts by the US Secretary of Defence to have the programme
halted in favour of conventional helicopters and transport aircraft, the
Osprey has survived several rounds of budget cutting, thanks mainly to
lobbying by the US Marine Corps.  The first production aircraft is expected
to fly in December 1996.

Current production plans consist of 552 MV-22A assault transports for the
USMC, 50 HV-22A combat rescue aircraft for the US Navy, and 55 CV-22A
special mission transports for the Special Operations Forces.  The US
Army's original requirement for 251 of the transport version has been
deferred, but not irrevocably cancelled.  Japan is expected to order four
search and rescue aircraft, and is considering the V-22 for the
anti-submarine role.

Vital statistics (MV-22A):  length 19.09 m, span 14.36 m, empty weight
14463 kg, max weight 27442 kg, max speed 556 km/h, range 3892 km, payload
9072 kg; power plant:  two 4586 kW Allison T406-AD-400 turboshafts.

Subject:  B.3.  Boeing/Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche (1998 Nov 18)

The LHX (Light Helicopter X) programme, to provide the US Army with a light
scout/attack helicopter to replace the AH-1 Cobra, OH-6 Cayuse, and OH-56
Kiowa, was initiated in 1982.  The original plan was to acquire 5000
helicopters, in a mixture of LHX SCAT (scout/attack) and LHX Utility
versions; the latter was intended as a UH-1 replacement.  The utility role
was dropped, and the requirement reduced to 2096 aircraft, in 1987.  Two
consortia were awarded demonstration and validation contracts in October
1988, one consisting of Bell and McDonnell Douglas, the other Boeing and
Sikorsky.  On 5 April 1991, the Boeing/Sikorsky team was awarded a contract
for development of the LHX, now designated RAH-66A Comanche.

Aircraft 1 (S/N 94-0327) first flew on 4 January 1996.  At this point in its
development (1998 Nov 18), it has flown a total of 111 hours, reached 
speeds of 171 KTAS in level flight, and is conducting envelope 
expansion for continued development.  Aircraft 2 (S/N 95-0001) is being 
prepared for its first flight, scheduled to occur on March 1,  1999.  
95-0001 will serve as the primary test aircraft for the system's mission 
equipment package.  Initial Operational Capability for the aircraft is 
scheduled for 15 December 2006.

The production total is now expected to be 1292 aircraft, of which about 
one third will be the RAH-66B version, carrying a slightly smaller version 
of the Longbow radar fitted to the AH-64D Apache.

Vital statistics (RAH-66A):  fuselage length 13.22 m, rotor diameter 11.90
m, empty weight 3402 kg, max weight 7790 kg, max speed 328 km/h, range 2335
km; power plant:  two 690 kW LHTEC T800-LHT-800 turboshafts; armament:
20mm cannon, internal and external carriage for up to 14 Hellfire or 18
Stinger missiles.

Subject:  B.4.  Dassault Rafale

When France withdrew from what was then the FEFA programme (now Eurofighter
2000; see below) in 1985, Dassault went ahead with a very similar multirole
fighter of its own, named Rafale (squall).  In the first few years there
were half-hearted attempts to bring in foreign partners, but nothing came
of this.  The first prototype Rafale A flew on 4 July 1986.

The Armée de l'Air (French AF) has ordered the "Rafale D", a generic name
covering the two-seat Rafale B and single-seat Rafale C; the first
pre-production Rafale C flew on 19 May 1991.  The original plan was for a
force consisting mainly of single-seat aircraft, but the Armée de l'Air now
appears to like the idea of two-seat combat aircraft, and it is expected
that most, possibly all, of the Rafales for the Armée de l'Air will be the
Rafale B version.  The Armée de l'Air is expected to order 235 Rafales,
entering service in 2000, or possibly 2002.

The Aéronavale (French Navy air arm) has ordered the Rafale M, a single
seat carrier-borne fighter; the first Rafale M flew on 12 December 1991,
and made its first carrier landing on the _Foch_ on 19 April 1993.  The
Aéronavale intends to purchase 86 Rafales, probably entering service in
1999.

Vital statistics (Rafale B):  length 15.30 m, span 10.90 m, empty weight
9550 kg, max weight 19500 kg, max speed 2124 km/h (Mach 2.0), ferry range
3706 km; power plant:  two 72.90 kN Snecma M88-2 augmented turbofans;
armament:  30mm cannon, AAM rail on each wingtip, 14 hardpoints; max
external load 8000 kg.

Subject:  B.5.  Eurofighter Typhoon (formerly Eurofighter 2000)

The origins of Eurofighter 2000 go back to 1972 and an RAF request for
a future STOVL capable ground attack aircraft. After later discussions 
between Britain, France and Germany a common STOL capable platform was 
requested. This led to the European Combat Aircraft (ECA) program being 
initiated, it later failed due to differences in baseline requirements 
primarily imposed by France. The project was later resurrected by BAe 
and MBB of Germany as the European Combat Fighter (ECF). Both the 
British and German governments showed interest but budgetary constraints 
consigned this project to history. By this time BAe was already 
examining its own future fighter technology in the form of the P.106 
and P.110, MBB initiated the TFK-90 project and Dassault the ACX which 
later found form as the Rafale.

In 1982 Britain's P.110 and Germany's TFK-90 were combined with work 
by Italy's Aeritalia to form the ACA, Agile Combat Aircraft. Funding 
problems led to official German and Italian government support being 
withdrawn. Work continued though with the construction of the EAP, 
Experimental Aircraft Program demonstrator primarily funded by BAe 
and the British MoD, but with input from MBB and Aeritalia. This 
demonstrator, flying a total of 259 sorties between August 1986 and 
May 1991 would save hundreds of millions of pounds in development costs 
and demonstrate a number of new technologies for the Eurofighter.

A new British, German, French, Italian and Spanish effort was launched 
in 1983 to develop a common European fighter, termed F/EFA (Future 
European Fighter Aircraft). However like its predecessors it was 
doomed to failure primarily due to French demands on project workshare 
and requirements. In August 1985 Britain, Germany and Italy split from 
the F/EFA to form their own fighter project, they were joined in 1986 
by Spain leading to the formation of Eurofighter. Initial future 
workshares based on governmental orders were 33% each to Britain and 
Germany, 21% to Italy and 13% to Spain.

Progress on Eurofighter was swift with a joint baseline requirement being 
issued in 1987 and contracts for the structure and engines being signed 
in 1988. In 1992 Germany announced its intention to withdraw from the 
project due mainly to budgetary constraints and the reduction in 
forseable threat. After examinations by Eurofighter of seven variants 
of the aircraft the conclusion was that none matched the baseline systems 
performance and only two (single engined) variants were cheaper. To 
achieve the 30% cost reduction demanded, Germany instead would be allowed 
to delay service entry by two years and fit cheaper equipment.

In 1994 the first two Development Aircraft (DA) were to fly, one German 
(DA1) and one British (DA2). A year later in 1995 the first aircraft 
to be fitted with the newly developed EJ200 turbofans was to fly, the 
Italian DA3. Four more DA's were to follow including two dual seat 
models and avionics integration aircraft fitted with the ECR-90 radar.

In 1995 problems arose concerning workshare. Although the number of 
fighters to be purchased by each country had reduced, 250 to 232 fighters 
for Britain, 250 to 140 for Germany, 130 to 121 for Italy and 100 to 87 
for Spain, the workshares had remained the same. After much discussion 
a new workshare agreement was signed giving 37% for Britain, 30% for 
Germany, 20% for Italy and 13% for Spain with Germany taking 180 fighters 
instead of 140. 

In September 1996 Britain announced funding of the construction phase 
followed by Spain in November. Germany continued to drag its heels through 
1996 and 1997. Following pressure from Britain Germany agreed to additional 
funding of DM100million in July 1997 to keep the DA program on schedule. 
Finally, in December 1997 Germany announced full funding for 180 
Eurofighter's, Italy quickly followed suit. 

In January 1998 official Memoranda of Understanding were signed between 
NETMA, Eurofighter and EuroJet for production of 620 aircraft (and 90 
options) costing around $32b. This was followed in March and May by the 
signing of production investment agreements between Eurofighter, EuroRADAR and 
EuroDASS respectively. The Eurofighter finally took the official name 
'Typhoon' on the 2nd of September 1998 although this only applies to 
export models. Fatigue testing of the airframe was completed a few 
days later with a total of 18000 hours of simulated flight on the clock, 
this equates to three times the life of the aircraft. A major milestone 
was reached later that September (the 21st) when the first tranche of 
148 aircraft were ordered. Of this number, 55 will go to the RAF, 44 to 
the Luftwaffe, 29 to the Italian airforce and 20 to Spain.

Earlier this year in January construction began on what will become the 
first of five IPAs or Instrumented Production Aircraft. These will be 
delivered to the operational evaluation units of each founder consortium 
nation between summer and winter 2001. The project at this time remains on 
schedule with over 800 sorties completed and the vast majority of the 
Initial Operational Capability of the aircraft having been examined. In 
addition a number of systems are in the process of being upgraded to a 
'post 2000' standard. These include the replacement of cockpit displays 
with Active Matrix Liquid Crystal units as well as changes to the 
flight helment and other systems. The ITP developed 3D Thrust Vectoring 
Control nozzle started undergoing static rig trials in summer 1998 and 
it remains on schedule for possible Eurofighter based trials in 2001. 
In addition the GTDAR consortium have revealed that a preliminary 
version of its AMSAR (Airborne Multi-mode Solid-state Active-array 
Radar) is undergoing trials with a full scale prototype excepted in 2002.

Beyond sales to the founding four nations there are potential export markets 
for the Eurofighter. In a surprise move in February 1999 Greece announced 
its intention to purchase between 60 and 80 Eurofighters to enter service 
from around 2005. At this time (May 1999) negotiations are under way between 
Eurofighter, NETMA, the founding consortium nation governments and the 
Greek Defence Ministry on terms of entry into the Eurofighter consortium. 
Norway has requested a bid from Eurofighter for 20 aircraft (in competition 
with Lockheed Martin for the F-16). Australia who recently published details 
on their future fighter requirements are potential suitors, as are South 
Korea, Saudi Arabia, Chile, Brazil, Turkey and others.

Updated: 2000 mar 24 (minor update, rest since 1998) (several correspondents)
Subject:  B.6.  JSF (Was JAST) X-32, X-35

The US Joint Advanced Strike Technology programme, established in early
1994, was intended to be a technology development programme rather than an
actual service aircraft.  It involved all the improvements that would be
expected for a next generation aircraft (advanced materials, stealth,
reduced costs, better systems integration, and so forth), plus two
particularly innovative concepts.  The first is the idea of a modular
aircraft design, so that individual aircraft could be built with different
combinations of components for different services and missions (take-off
capability, for example -- the same basic airframe could be built in
conventional runway versions for the USAF, carrier-borne versions for the
USN, and V/STOL versions for the USMC).  The second is the possibility of
providing a "virtual reality" environment for the pilot, which would
integrate tactical information with the outside view.

JAST inherited much of the defunct A/F-X project, and has been
partially combined with ARPA's X-32 project and is now called JSF, Joint
Strike Fighter. 

Twelve technology development contracts were awarded in May 1994, the
largest going to Boeing. Out of the three contractor teams Lockeed Martin, 
McDonnell Douglas/Northrop and Boeing two were awarded contracts to
each build two demonstrators, one to demonstrate the STOVL concept
and the two together showing all three variants through rebuilds.
The winners were Lockheed Martin, whose design will be called X-35A,
B and C and Boeing whose design will be X-32A, B and C. 
Any production fighter resulting from this competition will get
a completely different designation.

The chosen JSF will begin to replace the F-16 in USAF service, the 
F/A-18 (and possibly F-14 in some roles) in USN service, and the 
Harrier in USMC/RN service by 2008.

(The X-32 started life as ARPA's ASTOVL (Advanced Short Take-Off/Vertical
Landing) project, intended as a technology demonstrator to lead to a
supersonic successor to the Harrier.  This later became CALF (Common
Advanced Lightweight Fighter), a more general demonstrator for a future
lightweight fighter.  The UK is also involved in the project, putting up
about one third of the money.  The design has been made small enough for
service on Royal Navy carriers.)

Subject:  B.7.  LCA

The LCA (Light Combat Aircraft) is India's second indigenous jet fighter
design, after the HF-24 Marut of the 1950s.  Development began in 1983; the
basic design was finalised in 1990, and two prototypes are currently
approaching completion, with first flight expected sometime in 1995.

The configuration is a delta wing, with no tailplanes or foreplanes, and a
single vertical fin.  The LCA will be constructed of aluminium-lithium
alloys, carbon-fibre composites, and titanium.  The design incorporates
"control-configured vehicle" concepts to enhance manoeuvrability, and
quadruplex fly-by-wire controls.

Both prototypes are powered by General Electric F404-GE-F2J3 engines, but
an indigenous engine, the GTX-35VS Kaveri, is being developed for the
production LCA.

No official name or other designation has been assigned to the LCA yet.

Vital statistics:  length 13.20 m, span 8.20 m, empty weight 5500 kg, clean
TO weight 8500 kg, max TO weight not given, max speed 1699 km/h (Mach 1.6);
power plant:  one 83.4 kN GTRE GTX-35VS augmented turbofan; armament:  one
GSh-23 twin-barrel 23mm cannon (220 rounds); 7 hardpoints; max external
load over 4000 kg.

Subject:  B.8.  Lockheed/Boeing F-22

The ATF (Advanced Technology Fighter) programme began in September 1983,
when design contracts were awarded to seven companies; in October 1986,
development contracts were awarded to two consortia, one consisting of
Lockheed (prime contractor), Boeing, and General Dynamics, the other of
Northrop (prime contractor) and McDonnell Douglas.  The first Northrop/MD
YF-23A (unofficially "Black Widow II") flew on 27 August 1990, followed by
the first Lockheed/Boeing/GD YF-22A (unofficially "Lightning II") on 29
September 1990.  In April 1991, the YF-22A was selected for development and
eventual service.

Recent budget cuts have slowed down the schedule slightly; the first flight
of the production Lockheed/Boeing F-22A (General Dynamics sold its fighter
division to Lockheed in December 1992), originally scheduled for June 1996,
will now be in (probably) March 1997.  Service entry is expected to begin
in 2003; the USAF is currently fighting an attempt by the General
Accounting Office to delay this to 2010.  Total production, originally
planned to be 648 aircraft, it was first reduced to 442 and has now 
been reduced to 338.

The F-22's official name is Raptor, but there were reports that
it would be Superstar, Rapier or Lightning II.

Vital statistics (YF-22A):  length 18.90 m, span 13.56 m, empty weight
15422 kg, max weight 28123 kg, max speed 2655 km/h (Mach 2.5), ferry range
3704 km; power plant:  two 155.68 kN Pratt & Whitney F119-100 augmented
turbofans; armament:  20mm cannon, internal bays for two AIM-9 and four
AIM-120A or six AIM-120C air-to-air missiles, or two AIM-9, two AIM-120,
and two air-to-surface missiles, external hardpoints for four more AIM-120s
or other ordnance; radar:  Westinghouse/Texas Instruments APG-77.

The F-22 will have room internally for two 900 kg JDAM bombs in
place of the AMRAAMS, the four external hardpoints can accept either
an external tank each, a ground attack weapon, JDAM or cruise missile
or two AMRAAMs.

Subject:  B.9.  McDonnell Douglas C-17 Globemaster III

The USAF initiated the C-X (Cargo X) programme in October 1980; McDonnell
Douglas was selected as prime contractor on 19 August 1981.  The C-X, later
designated C-17, is primarily a C-141 replacement, with some overlap with
the roles of the C-5 and C-130.  The first prototype flew in September
1991.  The programme has suffered many technical and political setbacks,
but production has begun, although the USAF's order has been reduced from
the original 210.  40 have been definitely ordered, of which 10 had been
delivered by February 1994.  A follow-up order for another 80 is on hold,
conditional on MD correcting design flaws and cost overruns; a decision
will be made by the end of 1995.

McDonnell Douglas are considering a civilian airfreight version, under the
designation MD-17.

Vital statistics (C-17A):  length 53.04 m, span 52.20 m, empty weight
122016 kg, max weight 263083 kg, cruise speed 818 km/h, range 8710 km,

(Updated 2000-10-20)

Also known as MFI (Multirole Fighter/Interceptor), and sometimes referred
to in the West as "ATFski", Mikoyan's Project 1.42 is a low-visibility
multirole fighter, with air superiority as the primary mission, intended as
an Su-27/35 replacement; in short, the Russian equivalent of the F-22.  The
1.42 is one of the few Mikoyan projects to survive the recent wave of
defence budget cuts from the Kremlin, although its schedule has apparently
been slowed by shortage of funds as well as technical problems.

It has flown, but it's not expected to enter service.

The related Project 7.01, a heavier and stealthier interceptor designed
along similar lines, has been cancelled.

The only available vital statistic is a maximum take-off weight of 30000
kilograms.

Subject:  B.11.  Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit

Development of the ATB (Advanced Technology Bomber) began in 1978; the
programme was revealed to the public in 1981, when Northrop's design was
chosen over a Lockheed/Rockwell proposal.  Although no details of the
design were revealed, it was widely assumed that the aircraft would be a
"flying wing" design, based on Northrop's experience with the XB-35 and
YB-49, and this was confirmed when the first prototype was rolled out on 22
November 1988.  It made its first flight on 17 July 1989, and the first
production B-2 was delivered to the USAF in 1993.  Production plans have
been drastically cut from 135 aircraft to only 20, of which the last is
expected to be delivered in 1997.  The aircraft was officially named
"Spirit" in February 1994; Northrop became Northrop Grumman in May 1994.

Vital statistics (B-2A):  length 21.03 m, span 52.42 m, empty weight 72575
kg, max weight 168434 kg, max speed 1103 km/h, range 13898 km, payload

Subject:  B.12.  Saab/BAe Systems JAS 39 Gripen  (1998 Nov 18)

Development of the JAS 39 Gripen (JAS = Jakt/Attack/Spaning =
Fighter/Attack/Reconnaissance; Gripen = Griffon) began in 1980.  It is a
light weight multirole fighter, intended to gradually replace all versions
of the Saab 35 Draken and Saab 37 Viggen in Flygvapnet (Swedish AF) service;
development and production is carried out by IG-JAS, a consortium consisting
of Saab, Ericsson and Volvo Aero Corporation.

The first prototype flew on 9 December 1988; development has been delayed
by the loss of two aircraft in crashes attributed to faults in the digital
flight control software.  The programme remains intact, however, and the
Swedish government has ordered 204 of which more than 60 had been delivered
towards the end of 1998.

The first squadron was declared fully operational with the F 7 wing
at Såtenäs on Oct 1:st 1997. Eight squadrons will be operational
with the Swedish air force in 2004.

An agreement with Britain was signed in February 1994, under which 
British Aerospace will market the aircraft; BAe will be responsible 
for 45% of the fuselage production for export aircraft.

On 1998 Nov 18 the South African government announced that it had selected
Gripen and over the following months will negotiate a contract for 28 aircraft.

Subject:  B.13.  Shenyang J-8/F-8

Development of this large interceptor, the first jet fighter designed in
China to enter service, began in 1964.  The first prototype flew on 5 July
1969.  Production of the J-8I began in July 1979; about 100 were delivered
to the AFPLA before production ended in 1987.  The J-8I resembled a
scaled-up MiG-21 (J-7), with a tailed delta configuration powered by two
engines fed from a single annular nose intake, carrying radar in the
centrebody cone (it resembled Mikoyan's experimental Ye-152A, although,
contrary to some early reports, it was not based on that aircraft).

The more advanced J-8II was developed in the early 1980s, the first
prototype flying on 12 June 1984.  It differed externally in having two
side intakes (similar to an F-4 or MiG-23) and a solid nose with a much
larger radome.  A plan to fit American avionics, including an advanced
radar, fell through in the early 1990s; however, the J-8II has entered
production anyway, carrying a Chinese SR-4 "lookdown-shootdown" radar.
Both versions have been offered for export, as the F-8I and F-8II, but
there have been no takers so far.

Vital statistics (J-8II, estimated):  length 21.59 m, span 9.34 m, empty
weight 9820 kg, max weight 17800 kg, max speed 2336 km/h (Mach 2.2), ferry
range 2200 km; power plant:  two 65.90 kN Wopen 13A-II augmented turbojets;
armament:  one Type 23-3 twin-barrel 23mm cannon with 200 rounds, 7
hardpoints, max external load 3500 kg.
