<H3>VF-14 Top Hatters<BR>
Base:NAS Oceana<BR>
Tailcode:'AJ'<BR>
Callsign:'Camelot'<BR>
Variant:F-14A<BR></H3>

<P>VF-14 is the oldest US Navy squadron in existence, being able to 
trace it's history all the way back to 1919, although many re-designations
occurred in the first twenty-five years. Before becoming VF-14 the 
Tophatters were known by the designations VF-1, VS-41, VB-4, VA-1A, VA-14 
and finally gaining the VF-14 title on the 15th of December 1949.</P>
<P>When first established as a Pacific Fleet Air Detatchment, in 
September of 1919, the Tophatters flew the JN, or as it was more often 
called the 'Jenny'. </P>
<P>During WWII VS-41 flew SBD-3 Dauntless torpedo bombers from the deck 
of USS Ranger in the North African theatre during 1942. By November of 
the next year the squadron had been redesignated once more, this time 
becoming VB-4. Aircraft had also changed, now SBD-5 Dauntlesses were used 
instead, this time to attacks against German forces in Norway. Late 1944 
had seen a move to the Pacific theatre of war. Now flying SB2C Helldivers 
off the carrier USS Bunker Hill the Tophatters fought in the latter 
stages of the island hopping campaign. In 1945, for the last few months 
of the war, they switched to the USS Essex and took part in actions over 
Iwo Jima, Tokyo and Okinawa.</P>
<P>The high numbers of units involved in  WWII meant that the Tophat 
design was used by another squadron, VF-1, who flew in the Pacific 
theatre for most of the war. Best evidence seems to suggest this was 
simply due to confusion, the 'new' Tophatters being unaware that the 
original squadron still existed. One of the most famous incidents in this 
Tophatter's history occurred when Lt. Paul Pablo encountered a swarm of 
Japanese fighters in the Bonin Islands. Having previously flown an entire 
tour without seeing a Japanese aircraft the Lieutenant was understandably 
anxious to meet the enemy. When he finally did it was a huge swarm of 
fighters. Pablo was not heard from again, but his last transmission, "I've 
already got four, and I've got thirty cornered" symbolises the fighter 
pilot's credo, that only a spirit of attack will preveil. The 'new' 
Tophatters were disestablished shortly after the war ended, leaving the 
original squadron to carry on.</P>
<P>After the war the Tophatters received two changes of designation in a 
short period of (as was the case for most Navy squadrons at this time, as 
an effort was made to organise the rather chaotic numbering system). 
VB-4, as the Tophatters had ended the war, became VA-1A in November of 
1946, changing again to become VA-14 in August 1948. The final 
designation change, to the present VF-14, occurred upon the 15th of 
December 1949. </P>
<P>The redesignation to VF-14 coincided with the squadron's entry into 
the jet age, and thus with their receipt of F3D Skynights. The 
association with the Skynight was not to last long, however, F3H Demon's 
arriving in the first months of 1950. VF-14 flew the Demo's for 13 years, 
not relinquishing them unitl F-4B Phantom II's arrived in May of 1963. 
Flying their new mounts VF-14 became the first Phantom squadron to 
operate from the USS Roosevelt (not the present CVN-71).</P>
<P>1966 saw VF-14 become involved in the Vietnam war, whilst flying form 
the Roosevelt VF-14 took part in 967 combat sorties and dropped 651,624 
tons of ordnance. </P>
<P>For their next cruise, in 1968, VF-14 returned to the East Coast, flying 
off the newest aircraft carrier, USS John F.Kennedy.</P>
<P>Receiving their first F-14s in September 1974, the squadron worked up for
it's first deployment as part of  CVW-1 onboard USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) 
in the Mediterranean. The 
cruise lasted from June 1975 to January 1976, the first time F-14A's had 
been deployed with the Atlantic fleet. This was followed by two similar 
deployments onboard Kennedy, starting in August 1980 and July 1981
respectively. </P>
<P>During the 1980 cruise VF-14 won the COMNAVAIRLANT (Commander 
Naval Air Forces Atlantic) Battle "E" award for the second year in a row. 
In June 1982, the squadron shifted to CVW-6 onboard USS Independence 
(CV-62). In this and all subsequent deployments VF-14 was partnered by 
VF-32.</P> 
<P>In 1983 the squadron took part in two conflicts, firstly the US invasion of
Grenada,then the US airstrike on the Lebanon in December of that year. </P>
<P>On April 1st 1985 VF-14 was on the move again, returning to USS 
John F. Kennedy, but this time as part of CVW-3. The year featured 
some eventful deployments for the Tophatters, who took part in Red 
Flag 85-4 during June. Red Flag is a world famous series of exercises, 
the aim of which is to put pilots and planes in the most realistic 
simulation of war that can be created within peacetime safety rules. Red 
Flag has emphasised composite force tactics from the very beginning, 
the aim being to integrate fighters, strikers, recon and transport 
aircraft into a package that can work fluidly and well together. VF-14's 
deployment probably consisted of a good range of interception and 
strike escort missions. Two months later, in August, VF-14 took part in 
it's annual FFARP (Fleet Fighter ACM Readiness Program), the first to 
feature the F-21A Kfir as aggressor aircraft.</P>
<P>The Tophatters were proud to be able to celebrate their 70th 
anniversary in 1989, being the first Naval squadron to reach this grand 
age. Among other celebrations the squadron emblazoned the "70th 
Anniversary" legend across the tails of their two high visibility 
F-14's.</P>  
<P>It was as part of CVW-3 that VF-14 took part in Desert Storm, the carrier and
air wing having been rushed to the area once the crisis had broken out. 
Receiving the call to duty on 10th August 1990 the carrier deployed just five
days later. The next five months were spent enforcing the U.N. sanctions and 
preparing for Desert Storm.  The squadron took part in the air campaign, 
unfortunately scoring no kills, but thankfully taking no losses either.</P> 
<P>After Desert Storm the squadron had several detachments, culminating 
in a successful missile shoot at NAS Roosevelt Roads and three weeks 
onboard the USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63).</P>
<P>December 1991 saw perhaps the biggest change to the squadron since 
transitioning to the F-14. In line with other Navy F-14 squadrons VF-14 
began to work up an air-to-ground capability, starting with the Tomcat 
Advanced Strike Syllabus (TASS) and progressing to air wing workups 
at NAS Fallon. Thus VF-14 became 'Bombcat' qualified and can carry a 
wide range of iron bombs, cluster weapons and in future guided 
munitions. After the workups another cruise followed. As tensions in 
the Persian Gulf rose again in July of 1992, Kennedy and her 
squadrons were emergency deployed, but then recalled within days as 
the problems cooled. The scheduled cruise thus began in October of 
1992 and included VF-14 participation in "Deny Flight" sorties over the 
former Yugoslavia.</P>
<P>In late 1995 the squadron was detached from CVW-3 and directly 
assigned to Fighter Wing One at NAS Oceana. </P>
<P>1996 saw much uncertainty for VF-14, with much debate over whether they
would continue to fly the F-14 or would become VFA-14 flying the F/A-18 Hornet
and helping to fill the lack of Hornet squadrons. Late 1996 saw the decision
made in favour of keeping VF-14 as an F-14 squadron and the summer had seen 
VF-14 participate in their first cruise for several years, joining CVW-8 
onboard USS John F. Kennedy for a Mediterrenean cruise which also saw a port 
visit to Portsmouth. While Kennedy was in Portsmouth at least one VF-14 
aircraft took part in the static display of the 1996 RNAS Yeovilton 
airshow, along with aircraft from VF-41, VS-24, VAW-124 and VFA-15. 
At the same time much of the rest of CVW-8 flew in to RAF Lakenheath for an 
overnight stop. By joining CVW-8 the squadron restored it to two F-14 
squadrons, the other being VF-41. This meant that for a short while both 
Atlantic and Pacific fleets had one airwing apiece that had two F-14 
squadrons, rather than the now more normal one. The Pacific equivalent of 
CVW-8 is CVW-14, which had both VF-11 and VF-31 assigned. However with 
the move of VF-11 from CVW-14 to CVW-7 in early 1997 it is now only the 
Atlantic Fleet that has any airwings with two F-14 squadrons.</P> 
<P>Now that VF-14 had once again regained their sea legs they (and VF-41) 
prepared for another Mediterranean Sea/Arabian Gulf cruise in Spring 1997. 
VF-14 is presently on cruise onboard the USS John F.Kennedy in the 
Mediterranean Ocean. The two squadrons have both received LANTIRN capable 
Tomcat's.</P>
<P>Looking even further into the future VF-14 is due to become the only F-14 
squadron that will receive the F/A-18E, sometime in 2001. All other F-14 
squadrons are due to convert to the F/A-18F.</P>
<P>The image below shows VF-14's first markings for the F-14, extremely high 
visibility compared to the present markings. As well as the red tail the 
airwing code was carried in black on the inner surfaces of the tails. 
The aircraft carries its carrier name, USS John F. Kennedy, on the lower edge 
of the intake, a practice common among several F-14 squadrons in the early 
years of flying the F-14. Present practice generally sees the name carried on 
the wing root, just aft of the glove vane. </P>

<P>Today's VF-14 markings are much more subdued, if the triangle on the tail 
is carried at all it is only as a dark grey outline. The Tophat also 
tends towards dark grey. A dark grey tailcode is carried on the inner surface 
of the tails. The squadron's hi-vis aircraft are slightly more colourful, 
having the triangle in red and carrying the Tophat on a white background. </P>

<P>As of late 1996 VF-14 had the following F-14A's assigned:-<BR>
