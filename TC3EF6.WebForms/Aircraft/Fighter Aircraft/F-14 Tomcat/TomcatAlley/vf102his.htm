<H3>VF-102 Diamondbacks<BR>
Base:NAS Oceana<BR>
Tailcode:'AB'<BR>
Callsign:'Diamond'<BR>
Variant:F-14B<BR></H3>

<P>The present VF-102 was established on the 1st of July 1955 at NAS 
Jacksonville, Florida. Before flying Tomcat's the squadron flew F2H 
Banshees, F4D-1 Skyrays and the F-4 Phantom. VF-102's first ever 
cruise was onboard the USS Randolph from July of 1956. After 
returning to NAS Jacksonville VF-102 began to transition to the Douglas 
F-4D-1 Skyray, one of the first planes to carry the new AIM-9B 
Sidewinder heat seeking missile.</P>
<P>Transition to the F-4B Phantom began in 1960, VF-102 having moved 
to NAS Oceana at some time before this. In the next twenty years VF-
102 got to know the F-4 very well, some of it's more impressive 
achievements being:- "Operation Sea Orbit", the first nuclear task force 
circumnavigation of the globe, demonstrating how much a carrier's 
range and endurance could be improved by using a nuclear power 
plant. </P>
<P>VF-102 won the COMNAVAIRLANT Battle "E" efficiency awards in 1964 
and 1966. Then in 1968 VF-102, as with most Navy squadrons, did it's 
part in the Vietnam war. </P>
<P> After 20 years flying Phantom's the squadron started transitioning to 
the F-14A in July 1981, completing the change by May 1982. In mid 
1994 the squadron upgraded to the F-14B, which incorporates GE F110 
engines instead of the trouble prone P&W TF-30s. Avionics remain 
almost identical to the F-14A.</P>
<P>The squadron is part of CVW-1 on board the USS America (CV-66), 
up until 1995 being paired with VF-33. In March 1986 the squadron's 
Tomcat's were fired on by Libyan SAM's and triple-A while flying CAP's 
for Operation Prairie Fire. A month later VF-102 again flew top cover, 
this time protecting US Navy A-6's  and USAF F-111's that took part in 
Operation El Dorado Canyon. No combat losses were suffered on either 
occasion. </P>
<P>The next call to action was during Operation Desert Shield/Storm, 
after a shorter than usual work up period the two squadrons deployed 
in late December and within 48 hours of arriving were flying combat 
operations over Iraq. VF-102 and VF-33 were the only squadrons to fly 
combat missions from both the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea during the 
Gulf conflict, operating from USS America (CV-66). In the six week 
campaign VF-102 logged more than 1400 combat flight hours.</P>
<P>In August of 1993 VF-102 became the first F-14 squadron to try out 
the new US Navy air wing concept, where there is only one squadron 
of F-14's per wing. This took place on America's August 1993 to 
February 1994 cruise in the Mediterranean. The single squadron was 
expanded from 8 to 14 Tomcats, and the normal second squadron (VF-
33) not embarked, having been disestablished. VF-102 managed to clock 
up an impressive 98.7% mission capable rate, while being involved in 
CAP patrols over Bosnia (Deny Flight and Provide Promise), Iraq 
(Southern Watch) and Somalia (Restore Hope). Due to VF-102's success 
the navy decided to change the composition of all CVW's, removing one 
squadron of F-14's and replacing it in two ways, firstly enlarging the 
remaining F-14 squadron and secondly adding a third squadron of 10 
F/A-18 Hornets, thus giving the air wing more air-to-ground capability.</P>
<P>VF-102 was now USS America's sole F-14 unit and by the 24th of 
February 1996 the unit had completed it's final deployment on-board 
America, returning to NAS Oceana. After America's retirement VF-102 (and the rest of  CVW-1) have moved to  
USS George Washington (CVN-73), with CVN-73's previous airwing, 
CVW-7, having moved to the newest Navy carrier, USS John C. Stennis 
(CVN-74).</P>
<P>VF-102 is a TARPS capable unit, having been so since the squadron 
first received the F-14A,  and so generally has four TARPS capable 
birds when deployed, the remainder being a mix of 'vanilla' and LANTIRN capable F-14's.</P>
<P>VF-102 is now active with LANTIRN aircraft and pods, presently at NAS Oceana they are undergoing work ups for thier next cruise,
the first onboard USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74).</P>
<P>For much of the 1980's VF-102 markings took the form of the 'AB' tailcode surrounded by a diamond and a sash of diamonds
on the forward fuselage, illustrated below.<BR>

<P>Today the squadron markings are surprisingly colourful in these days of 
low vis camouflage and generally take the form of a snake (the 
squadron namesake- the Diamondback) coiled around a globe on the tail. 
Also on the tail is the legend USA in red white and blue. Finally a sash 
of diamonds stretches across the forward fuselage, in much the same 
way as on 'Jolly Rogers' F-14s. On the boss and CAG birds these 
markings are full colour, but on other machines tend to be low vis 
grey. </P>

<P>As of late 1996 VF-102 had the following aircraft assigned:-<BR>
