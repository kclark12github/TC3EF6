<H3>VF-41 Black Aces<BR>
Base:NAS Oceana<BR>
Tailcode:'AJ'<BR>
Callsign:'Fast Eagle'<BR>
Variant:F-14A<BR></H3>

<P>The present VF-41 was created at NAS Oceana on the 1st of 
September 1950, becoming the fourth US Navy squadron to bear that 
designation. At first the squadron was equipped with the F-4U Corsair, 
but early in the 1950's transitioned to F-2H Banshees. While with the 
Banshees VF-41 deployed to the Mediterranean and Far East onboard 
the USS Independence. The Banshees were lost in 1959, when VF-41 
received the F3H-2 Demon. The Demon was the first Navy fighter to be 
capable of all-weather operation, being equipped with forward quarter 
radar guided missiles. The time spent operating the Demon was short, 
as VF-41 exchanged them for new F-4B Phantom IIs in February of 
1962. When the Cuban Missile Crisis flared up in October of that year 
VF-41 made a rapid deployment to NAS Key West, standing ready to 
assist if the decision was taken to invade Cuba or to attack the missile 
sites.</P>
<P>In 1965 VF-41 deployed to the South East Asian theatre, where the 
Vietnam war was still escalating. Starting in May of '65, the deployment 
lasted seven months and saw VF-41 fly a wide range of missions:-
fighter cover, reconnaissance escort, flak suppression and day/night 
interdiction, thus demonstrating just how versatile a platform the F-4 
was.</P>
<P>The Black Aces' next deployment to a combat zone was in 1973, when 
the squadron deployed as part of the peacekeeping force that helped to 
keep the truce after the October War.</P>
<P>By 1975 VF-41 had moved from the F-4B to the F-4N and spent it's 
last cruise with the Phantom onboard USS Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
During 1975 VF-41 picked up the COMNAVAIRLANT Safety "S", an 
award it was to win again in 1981, 1989 and 1992. In April of 1976 the 
first F-14A Tomcat arrived, the first cruise with their new mount 
beginning in December 1977, as part of CVW-8 onboard the USS Nimtz 
CVN-68), the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier to join the Atlantic 
Fleet. Further cruises followed in 1978 and 1979, both seeing the 
carrier deploy to the Mediterranean. In 1980 Nimtz and CVW-8 took part 
in a round the world cruise. During this cruise the carrier served as 
the seaborne base for the abortive operation to rescue the US Embassy 
hostages from Iran. Due to these factors VF-41 (and the rest of the 
battle group) spent 144 continuous days at sea, the longest period the 
squadron had spent at sea without a break since World War II. </P>
<P>The risks inherent in Naval Aviation were terribly brought home to 
VF-41 during work ups for their 1981-82 Mediterranean cruise. An EA-
6B Prowler crashed onto the flight deck of the Nimtz, causing damage 
and starting fires. In the crash and subsequent damage control 
operations VF-41 lost three members and three F-14's. </P>
<P>19th of August, 1981, saw a very different day for the Black Aces. Flying a 
Combat Air Patrol over the Gulf of Sidra, two VF-41 aircraft, callsigns 
"Fast Eagle 102" and "Fast Eagle 107" were intercepted then fired upon 
by two Libyan Su-22 Fitters. As with the VF-32 incident the F-14's 
were able to manoeuvre into firing positions and then downed both 
Fitters. The incident marked the first time the F-14 had been used in 
air to air combat, the first Navy air combat since the end of the 
Vietnamese War and the worlds' first engagement between variable 
geometry (swing wing) fighters.</P>
<P>1981 was also the first year in which the Black Aces won the 
COMNAVAIRLANT Battle "E", signifying them as the most efficient 
squadron in the Atlantic fleet. VF-41 were also to collect this award in 
1985 and 1989. </P>
<P>Regular cruises to the Mediterranean followed, the 1982 cruise saw 
the squadron operate as part of the multi-national peace keeping force 
off the Lebanese coast, while the 1985 cruise saw the battle group 
spend 68 days off the Lebanese coast, this time in response to the 
hijacking of a TWA airliner. If the hijacking had not been solved by 
other means it is quite conceivable that VF-41 (and VF-84) would have 
been employed in much the same way as VF-74 and VF-103 were during 
the Achille Lauro incident, to intercept the hijackers and force them 
down to a place where they could be tried.</P>
<P>The cruise that began in December 1986 was to be VF-41's last with 
the USS Nimtz. When the carrier pulled into her new west coast home in 
June of 1987 VF-41 said good-bye and returned to NAS Oceana.  In 
October of 1987 CVW-8 met up with their new mount, the USS Theodore 
Roosevelt (CVN-71).  The first deployment was to the North Atlantic 
for Exercise Teamwork '88, which involved operations with the 
Norwegian Air Force. The USS Roosevelt's first Mediterranean 
deployment occurred in December of 1987. </P>
<P>For a short while in 1990 VF-41 and CVW-8 deployed onto the Navy's 
newest carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72), but then began to 
prepare to deploy onboard USS Theodore Roosevelt again, in response 
to the Gulf Crisis. The Black Aces embarked onboard Roosevelt on the 
28th of December 1990, arriving in theatre shortly after the hostilities 
had started. Combat sorties began straight away and with the Iraqi air 
force refusing to directly challenge the coalition's fighters VF-41 was 
actively engaged in escorting strike and recon missions, as well as the 
more usual CAP's. By February the pace of operations had increased 
considerably, with the Iraqi air defences in bad shape F-14's from VF-
41 and other squadrons ranged deep into Iraq in search of enemy 
aircraft, especially those attempting to escape to Iran. By February 
28th VF-41 had completed 1500 combat flight hours, with an amazing 
100% of sorties scheduled being completed. After the cease-fire had 
been agreed the USS Roosevelt and VF-41 remained in the Arabian Gulf 
to help enforce it. In April the battle group was moved to Turkey's 
Mediterranean coast to provide assistance to Kurdish refugees as part 
of Operation Provide Comfort. The Black Aces finally returned to NAS 
Oceana on the 26th of June 1991, performing a triumphant flyover of 
the base to celebrate their safe return. </P>
<P>VF-41 were soon back into the regular ritual of training, with more 
emphasis shifting to air to ground tactics as the F-14 community picked 
up the strike fighter role.</P>
<P>As of late 1991 VF-41 had flown over 46,500 hours without an 
accident over a time period of 11 years. </P>
<P>With the disestablishment of VF-84 in 1995 VF-41 picked up the 
TARPS mission, adding  to their capabilities. The disestablishment of 
VF-84 over VF-41 was the only occasion (in the active Navy) where a 
non-TARPS unit has survived over a TARPS capable unit, although I 
am not sure why. Thankfully VF-84 was not fully lost, with the Jolly 
Rogers insignia and tradition being moved to VF-103. </P>
<P>VF-41 has recently completed a mini North Atlantic cruise onboard 
USS John F. Kennedy, during which they were accompanied by VF-14, 
thus breaking the new Navy tradition of having only one F-14 squadron 
per air wing. Presumably this was to allow VF-14, which has been 
shore based for over two years, to test out their sea legs before a full 
cruise. This included a port visit to Portsmouth Naval Base on the th 
June. Also at least one VF-41 F-14A attended the RNAS Yeovilton 
airshow, providing much interest in the static display (alongside a VF-
14 F-14A), while much of the air wing moved off the boat and spent at 
least one night at RAF Lakenheath, providing an impressive spectacle 
for those who were there to watch the mass takeoff the next morning 
(much to my disgust I missed it-anyone out there have any photos they 
are willing to share?).</P>
<P>For the future VF-41 will continue to improve their air to ground 
skills, as part of the fleet wide upgrade they have received 
LANTIRN capable aircraft and pods, allowing them to designate 
targets for LGB's by themselves and to navigate effectively at night and at
low level. At the same time VF-41 also received Night Vision 
Goggles to complement the LANTIRN capability. Both these new pieces of 
equipment are being used to their utmost at present, as VF-41 is on 
cruise in the Mediterranean/Persian Gulf onboard USS John F.Kennedy 
(CV-67), once again as part of CVW-8 and partnering VF-14.</P>
<P>Markings for Black Aces Tomcats have changed significantly over the 
years. When F-14's were first introduced they featured a very large ace 
of spades on a white background, with the tailcode superimposed in 
white, and a black radome and anti glare panel. As orders came down 
to tone down markings VF-41 lost the black radome and white tail, also 
reducing in size the ace of spades. Now instead of the tailcode, "41" 
was carried inside the spade, with the tailcode being reduced to very 
small letters, often at the base of the fin, an example of the markings 
of this period can be seen below. Of note is the fact that this image 
depicts 'Fast Eagle 107' and so has a Su-22 kill marking under the 
cockpit. </P>

<P>After the Gulf War (during which at least one VF-41 F-14 
had nose art) the tail design changed slightly, with the ace of spade now 
being featured inside a full playing card design. However the markings have 
started to change again very recently, losing the full card, but retaining 
the ace of spades, this time with a red stripe running from the bottom front 
of the tail to the upper rear.</P>
