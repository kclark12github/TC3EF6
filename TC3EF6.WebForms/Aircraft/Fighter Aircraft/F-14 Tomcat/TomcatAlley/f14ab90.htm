<P><H3>Block 90</H3>
<H4><P> Aircraft of this block were the first to feature an angle of attack probe at the tip of the nose cone (although I do have a source that states this did not occur until Block 95). Provision was made for automated maneuvering flaps, although I am unsure whether they were actually fitted at this time. These flaps enhanced the F-14's ability to maneuvre at high angles of attack.
