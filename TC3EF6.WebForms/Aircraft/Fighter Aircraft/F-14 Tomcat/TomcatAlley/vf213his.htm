<H3>VF-213 Blacklions<BR>
Base:NAS Oceana<BR>
Tailcode:'NH'<BR>
Callsign:'Blacklion'<BR>
Variant:F-14A<BR></H3>

<P>The Blacklions were established as VF-213 on the 22nd of June 1955 and thus are one of a rare breed 
among Navy squadrons in that they retain the designation they were established with.
VF-213 were among the first Miramar squadrons to receive the F-14A, beginning conversion to it in 
September 1976, the new F-14 replacing venerable F-4B Phantom II's. Quickly becoming proficient on 
their new mount VF-213 departed for their first cruise as part of CVW-11 in October 1977. This first 
cruise took place on board the USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) and saw VF-213 paired with VF-114 
'Aardvarks', a pairing that was to last until the Aardvarks were disestablished.
After their Kitty Hawk cruise VF-213 and CVW-11 shifted to the USS America (CV-66) and took part 
in two Mediterranean cruises, one in 1979 and the other in 1981.</P>
<P>1982 saw VF-213 gain the first of their TARPS capable F-14's and quickly become proficient with the 
new equipment and role. </P>
<P>Late in 1982 CVW-11 once again moved carriers, this time to the nuclear powered USS Enterprise 
(CVN-65), beginning a partnership that was to last throughout most of the 1980's. Another cruise 
on board Enterprise followed in 1984 and regular cruises followed until Enterprise had to go into dock 
for nuclear refuelling. During this period CVW-11 (and VF-213) shifted to the USS Abraham Lincoln.
With VF-114 disestablished VF-213 now provides the main battle group protection for the Enterprise, 
with whom they are now reunited, and her battle group, as well as providing extra strike capability 
through their 'Bombcat capabilities. In the next few years these capabilities will be substantially 
increased with the introduction of NVG's and LANTIRN pods to allow VF-213 to designate targets for 
their own LGB's and to fly and navigate accurately at night. </P>
<P>The image below shows a VF-213 aircraft from the early 1990's, in very low-vis camouflage. The present 
scheme is slightly more noticeable, having added horizontal lines to separate the tailcode and lion (which has now reverted to having only one tail). The Co's aircraft has gold/yellow highlighting of the lines and tailcode.</P>
