<H3>VF-21 Freelancers <BR>
Base:NAS Yokosuka, Japan<BR>
Tailcode:'NK'<BR>
Callsign:'Lance'<BR>
Variant:F-14A<BR></H3>
 
<P>The squadron today known as VF-21 was first established in 1944 as 
VF-81, acquiring it's present designation in 1959, thus becoming the 
second US Navy squadron to be designated VF-21. The first Tomcats 
arrived in November 1983, replacing F-4N Phantoms. The transition was 
completed in March 1984.</P> 
<P>At first VF-21 was assigned to the carrier USS Constellation (CV-64) 
as part of CVW-14. A number of cruises followed until in 1990 the 
squadron moved, along with the rest of CVW-14 to the USS 
Independence (CV-62). The USS Independence was the first carrier to 
reach the Persian Gulf in response to the crisis of August 1990. 
However the squadron did not take part in Desert Shield, as by that 
time the carrier had returned to the US, but VF-21 played an important 
part in protecting the build up of allied forces in the Gulf and along 
with other rapid reaction units it is possible they are what deterred 
Saddam Hussein from attacking Saudi Arabia.</P>
<P>In August of 1991 the squadron moved to Japan, when USS 
Independence took over the role of USS Midway (CV-41) in being the 
only carrier home ported outside the USA, at Yokusuka. During this 
change the squadron stayed with the same carrier but moved air wings, 
from CVW-14 to CVW-5. This was because Midway's air wing had been 
without Tomcats, as the older Midway could not accommodate the F-14's 
size and weight. During the whole of it's F-14 career VF-21 has been 
partnered by VF-154.</P>
<P>This latest cruise of USS Independence has not been without incident 
or tension. Along with the Nimtz (CVN-68) Independence and her air 
wing have been involved in operations to demonstrate US resolve in 
support of Taiwan, during the recent tensions when Chinese military 
forces held large scale exercises showing their displeasure at Taiwan's 
recent Presidential elections.</P>
<P>VF-21 returned from a deployment onboard USS Independence (CV-62) 
in late 1995. Unfortunately this was their last deployment and the 
squadron has now disestablished, the official disestablishment ceremony 
happening on the 31st of January 1996.</P>
<P> VF-21's aircraft are marked with a leaping panther, contained within 
a shark's fin shaped border. The background to the panther has been 
seen in many colours, ranging from a rainbow to no colour at all. One 
of the most persistent seems to be a yellow background. The aircraft 
also often sport black trim around the canopy.</P>
<P>The image below shows VF-21's CAG aircraft from around 1985. Of note is
the extended canopy hood, curving down to the front of the TCS pod, and the full colour tail
markings. At this time the 'NK' tailcode was carried in black on the inner surfaces of the tails.
As an interesting aside I'm presently completing a model of this scheme, expect to see pictures of it in the model section eventually.</P>
