Another exhibit at the 1996 Farnborough airshow, this E-2C had travelled all the way from NAS Paxtuent River to be at the show.
For some curious reason, even though there is clear space between the nose and the edge of the negative, I am informed that the picture cannot be 
developed without cutting the front of the nose off.</P>
