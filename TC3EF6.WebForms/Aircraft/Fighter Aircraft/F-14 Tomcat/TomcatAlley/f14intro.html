The Grumman F-14 Tomcat is the world's premier carrier-based fighter/interceptor.  Its missions
include Combat Air Patrol, Maritime Air Superiority, Deck-Launched Intercept, Tactical
Reconnaissance, and recently its latent ground-attack capability has finally
been tapped by the US Navy.

<p>
The F-14 is a two-seat, twin engine, supersonic aircraft with variable-geometry
wings.  The two crew members are seated in tandem inside the cockpit covered by a large one-piece canopy.  The canopy gives excellent visibility all around with negligible distortion.  On the starboard side of the fuselage just  ahead of the cockpit
is the retractable in-flight refuelling probe.  On the port side the 
boarding ladder and steps are located below the cockpit.  Several small
sensory tubes are mounted on both sides of the forward fuselage.

The engines are deliberately set wide apart and each is contained within its own
nacelle; thus reduces the detrimental effect a damaged engine would have on
the other one.  Although the trough between the two engine nacelles imposes drag penalty, it also provides additional lift, conformal weapons attachment, and extra storage space for fuel to the aircraft.  The rear fuselage area sandwiched between the engine nacelles
is known as the <em>pancake</em>.  The pancake provides some 40% additional
lift to the airframe.  The rear end of the pancake is the <em>beaver tail</em>, 
which contains a fuel-dump pipe and a small ECM (Electronic Counter Measure)
antenna fairing.  Located both above and below the pancake are the speed brakes.
The lower speed brake is split into two halves to accommodate the arrestor hook.
Right next to the hook are the chaff/flare dispensers.

<p>
The two rectangular-shaped air intakes offer a direct airflow path to the engines.
When viewed from the side, the intakes are sharply raked from top to bottom, 
ensuring that sufficient amount of air will get into the engines at high angles of
attack.  Viewed from straight ahead, the top portions of the intakes are tilted
towards the centerline of the aircraft and the bottom parts are canted outwards.
The adequate separation of the intakes reduces interference between intake
airflow and the fuselage boundary layer.

The shoulder-mounted wings are controlled by computer for automatic
sweep during flight; a manual override is provided to the pilot in case of
emergency or other special circumstances.  The normal sweep range is
20&#186; to 68&#186;, a 75&#186; oversweep position is available for
stowage aboard the carrier.
The wings sport full-span leading-edge slats, plain trailing-edge flaps, lift spoilers 
and dumpers.  The F-14 does not have conventional ailerons.  The primary method
of roll control is by differential deflection of the all-moving horizontal 
stabilizers, supplemented by the wing spoilers located along the trailing-edge
of the upper wing surface.  When the wing sweep is greater than 57&#186; the
horizontal tailplanes operate alone to provide roll, while the wing spoilers are
used during lower speed and angles of wing sweep (less than 57&#186;).

<p>
Two small retractable triangular-shaped vanes are mounted on the leading-edge
of the wing gloves.  These glove vanes are extended automatically at 
supersonic speed (between mach 1 and mach 1.4) to generate additional lift
ahead of the aircraft's center of gravity and to push the nose up.  By doing so they
help to reduce the loads on the tailplanes, therefore maintaining the Tomcat's
turning performance .  However, these vanes were subsequently deleted from the
B(A+) and D models to provide extra space for fuel and ECM equipments.

<p>
Inside each intake there are two variable-angle ramps and an air-bleed
door located on the ceiling of the inlets.  The ramps are controlled by an
air inlet computer, which calculates the optimal ramp positions based upon
the air temperature, air pressure, engine speed, and the angle of attack.  
Excess air is diverted out of the duct through the air-bleed door.

<p>
Underneath the nose of the F-14 A and B(A+), a TCS (Television Camera Set) pod
is carried along with a small position light and ECM fairing.  In the D model, a dual
chin pod is used to house both the TCS and the new IRST (InfraRed Search
and Track) system.  The position light and ECM antenna were retained.

The Tomcat's armaments include the obligatory M61A1 20mm cannon.  The cannon
muzzle and assembly are located on the port side of the fuselage, just ahead of
the boarding ladder.  For short-range air-to-air engagements, up to four AIM-9 
Sidewinders can be carried on the wing glove pylons.  As many as six 
medium-range AIM-7 Sparrow missiles can be fitted in the four missile wells
underneath the fuselage and slung below the two glove pylons.  The F-14 is the
only aircraft in the world capable of carrying the ultra long-range AIM-54 Phoenix
air-to-air missiles.  As with the Sparrows, the aircraft can carry up to two of them
below the wing glove pylons, and four underneath the fuselage with special
adaptor pallets.

<p>
In recent years the Navy had finally decided to utilize the Tomcat's latent 
ground-attack capability.  Its  air-to-ground arsenal  
include the Mk. 80 series iron bombs, cluster bomb units, and various 
laser-guided munitions.  The recent addition of the LANTIRN (Low Altitude Navigation/Targeting InfraRed for Night) pod system has transformed the Tomcat into a precision strike aircraft.
