<P><H3>F-14A General Description</H3> 
<P> 
<H4><P> The F-14A is a twin seat, twin engined interceptor, also capable of air-to-air, 
air-to-ground and reconnaisance roles.<BR>
The crew consists of two, seated in a tandem arrangement on Martin Baker GRU/7A zero-zero ejection seats, with the pilot in
 front and RIO (Radar Intercept Officer) in back (leading to the RIO's unofficial nickname-GIB ie Guy In Back) .<BR>
Two Pratt & Whitney TF30 engines are mounted in the intake trunks. <BR>
Primary weapon system is the AWG-9, which controls the radar, calculates intercepts, sets priorities and monitors other 
subsystems. Physical firing of missiles is done by the AWG-15 computer, to eliminate, as much as is possible, the chance of 
short circuits detonating ordnance.<BR>
Weapons carried include the AIM-9 Sidewinder, AIM-7 Sparrow, AIM-54 Phoenix, M61A1 20mm vulcan cannon, 
Mk80 series bombs, training bombs, Mk20 cluster bombs, sea mines and Laser Guided Bombs (LGB's).<BR>

<P><H3> F-14A Blocks</H3>
<H4><P>  After the 12 pre-production XF-14A's Grumman shifted production to the virtually identical F-14A, of which 557 were produced between December 1972 and early 1987. As with most military aircraft, 
production of the F-14A was divided into blocks, with detail changes in equipment between the blocks.<BR> 
For the F-14 blocks are separated by gaps of 5, ie block 35 is followed by 40, then 45 etc. Blocks 1 to 
55 were taken by the XF-14A's, the first production F-14's being block 60 aircraft. <BR>
The links below lead to pages with more detailed information on each block and the BuNos (Naval 
Bureau Number-a system that gives each aircraft a unique six digit number) of each aircraft within that 
block. If anyone is able to give more information about the different blocks or tell me which units aircraft
 have been assigned to (and indeed where they are now)  I would be most grateful. Please <A HREF="mailto:dmd4@aber.ac.uk">e-mail </A> me at this address.</P></H4>

<P>Sources <BR>
  F-14 serial numbers and blocks come primarily from the excellant Joe Baugher F-14 Tomcat History available online at <A HREF="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~pettypi/elevon/">Elevon, </A>
checked against the information in the World Air Power Journal Publication:-US Navy and Marine Corps-Air Power Directory. There are still some discrepencies however, so any new information is welcome.<BR>
The dates and squadron assignments of individual aircraft are arrived at mainly by reference to dated photos from a number of publications, these were:-<BR>
Colors and Markings of the F-14 Tomcat-Atlantic Coast Squadrons, (C & M vol 2)<BR>
Colors and Markings of the F-14 Tomcat-Pacific Coast Squadrons, (C & M vol 8)<BR>
Also used were various magazine articles and model kit decal sheets </P>
