<P>VF-194 and sister squadron VF-191 were the two shortest lived F-14 squadrons in history and 
are thus unfamiliar to many observers. The original VF-194 took part in WWII and the Korean conflict, but was disestablished on the 1st of March 1978.
Thus while the VF-194 established on the 1st of December 1986 can claim the unit's name and markings it did not have the heritage of the original VF-191.
After training with VF-124 and being due to deploy onboard the USS Independence as part of CVW-10 VF-194 was disestablished
before the cruise could take place. </P>
