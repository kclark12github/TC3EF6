<P>The VF-32 lineage can be traced back to it's establishment as VBF-3 
on 1st of February 1945, 3 years later on 7th August 1948 the squadron 
gained it's present designation. VF-32 deployed to the Korean theatre 
of war in 1950 with F4U-4 Corsairs. December the 4th, 1950 saw an 
impressive show of courage earn a VF-32 pilot the Congressional Medal 
of Honor. While on a strike against the Chosin reservoir the F4U-4 
Corsair of ENS J.L.Brown was shot down. To try and save his 
squadron mate from capture LTJG Hudner landed his plane alongside 
ENS Brown. Although his brave attempt ended in failure Hudner's 
bravery was recognised by the award of the medal, while ENS Brown 
received the D.F.C. </P>
<P>After Korea VF-32 moved from Corsairs to the F9F-6 Cougar, then in 
1956 became the first US Navy squadron to receive the F8U-1 Crusader, 
in the process becoming the first supersonic squadron in the Navy. 
Nine years with the Crusader followed, till in 1965 VF-32 moved to the 
F-4B Phantom II. Finally in July 1974 VF-32 began to transition to the 
F-14A , the first East Coast squadron to make the change. Their first 
deployment with their new mount began in June 1975. During this 
cruise the squadron received the Adm. Joseph Clifton Award, signifying 
them as the best squadron in the Navy, an impressive achievement after 
only so short a time with their new equipment. </P>
<P>1979 saw VF-32 setting another record, the 19th of October saw the 
squadron complete 10 years of accident free flying and 17,000 accident 
free hours in the F-14. </P>
<P>On these and almost all subsequent deployments VF-32 was partnered 
by VF-14. While the partner squadron was fairly consistent the air wing 
assignment changed several times:- on it's first cruise (and two 
subsequent) ones VF-32 was part of CVW-1 onboard USS John 
F.Kennedy (CV-67). In 1982 they moved to USS Independence (CV-62) 
for a cruise, after which the squadron started to receive the TARPS 
pod and suitably wired F-14's. This capability was extremely useful in 
the next cruise, again onboard USS Independence (CV-62), when it was 
used to provide high quality photo intelligence to support US forces in 
both Grenada and Lebanon. For this second cruise onboard USS 
Independence both VF-32 and VF-14 were moved to be part of CVW-6. 
A third Independence cruise was made between October 1984 and 
February 1985.</P>
<P>At this point VF-32 moved air wings again, rejoining CVW-3 for a 
cruise onboard USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67). One notable event 
during this cruise was the first night barrier engagement by an F-14, 
presumably after the bird suffered problems with it's arrestor hook. 
The 1989 cruise onboard Kennedy saw the Swordsmen thrust into the 
limelight when two of their F-14A's engaged two Libyan MiG-23 
Floggers. The 4th of January saw AC-202 (BuNo.???) and AC-207 
(BuNo.???) on Combat Air Patrol (CAP). The MiG-23's took off from Al 
Bumbaw airfield, Tobruk and began to close on the two F-14's. For 
several minutes the MiG's tried to maintain a bearing that would enable 
them to engage the F-14's, while the F-14's strove to disengage 
themselves without being forced to leave the area. However after 
several manoeuvres and confirmation that the MiG's were armed (using 
the F-14's Television Camera System (TCS)) it was decided the Libyans 
had shown hostile intent (although they had not actually fired) and so 
the Tomcats were cleared to engage. AC-202 turned in and fired a AIM-
7 sparrow, which failed to track. His wingman, in AC-207, also fired a 
Sparrow, which tracked and destroyed one of the MiG's, it's pilot 
successfully ejecting. AC-202 then closed to within AIM-9 Sidewinder 
range and managed to maintain a firing position. Once fired the 
Sidewinder continued to track and hit the MiG-23's rear fuselage. Again 
the pilot managed to eject successfully. With two MiG's splashed the F-
14's continued their patrol.</P>
<P>The squadron's next call to combat was as part of the 1991 Gulf 
conflict, as part of CVW-17 onboard Kennedy. Once again the 
squadron's TARPS capabilities proved invaluable, providing  pre and 
post strike pictures. One of the squadron's crews had the distinction of 
being the last Navy crew over Baghdad, five days after the cease-fire.</P>
<P>Since Desert Storm VF-32 resumed Mediterranean deployments, at first 
with VF-14, later on by itself, after VF-14 was detached from CVW-17. 
The squadron has added air to ground missions to it's repertoire over 
the last few years and will presumably receive LANTIRN pods over the 
next few years. </P>
<P>The Swordsmen's present deployment, onboard USS Theodore 
Roosevelt (CVN-71), which began at the end of November 1996, sees the 
first time that the Navy has deployed digital cameras onboard carrier 
aircraft. The new cameras are fitted in the squadron's TARPS pods, 
replacing the KS-87 camera. The new Pulnix cameras can take up to two 
hundred digital images, being able to store them onboard or transmit 
them to appropriately equipped ground or sea based recievers at ranges 
of up to 300km. This new equipment gives the Tomcat a near "real-
time" reconnaissance capability. As well as the new TARPS cameras the present
deployment has VF-32 flying LANTIRN equipped F-14A's, only the second squadron
to take this new Tomcat variant out to sea. </P>
<P>When first delivered VF-32's aircraft featured three yellow bands on 
the inside and outside of the tails. The middle band was by far the 
largest, with the upper and lower ones forming trim to the middle. The 
middle band featured a black sword on the rudder, while the stabilator 
carried the air wing code, for most of the 70's and early 80's this was 
'AB'. The image below shows how the squadron's early markings looked.<BR>

<P>In the early 80's, with the introduction of all over gull grey 
camoflage the middle yellow band was removed, the tailcode reduced in 
size and the sword moved onto the stabilator, the tailcode being 
superimposed upon it.</P>
<P>When VF-32 moved carriers and air wings the markings changed 
significantly. The tailcode, now 'AE' was placed vertically down the 
rudder, while the sword was replaced by a twin tailed tomcat (of the 
feline variety) leaning upon a sword. As TPS greys were intorduced 
the yellow was removed from the remaining tail bands, replaced by a 
contrasting grey. </P>
<P>By the 1991 Gulf War VF-32 had reverted to their earlier style of 
markings, although by now all the tail markings were in grey rather 
than black. However, as with all Navy squadrons, VF-32 was allowed to 
paint up to two aircraft in hi-vis markings. These aircraft featured 
black tails, with a large yellow sword, the tailcode 'AC' in black but 
shadowed in yellow and the upper and lower tail bands in yellow. At 
times the legend 'SWORDSMEN' was carried on the rudder. The aircraft 
also featured a black hood running from the nose, around the cockpit 
onto the spine. </P>
<P>In the latest pictures I have (early 1996) VF-32's markings feature 
three black lines in place of each of the upper and lower bands. These 
lines are also now carried on the inside of the tail. The sword is 
outlined in black, filled in with white. Black shadowing is used to 
reprsent the 'AC' tailcode and all aircraft now feature the 'SWORDSMEN' 
legend on the rudder. The hi-vis aircraft have lost their black tails, 
instead featuring yellow where most of the aircraft use white, but have 
retained the canopy hood.  </P>
<P>As of late 1996 VF-32 had the following aircraft assigned:-<BR>
