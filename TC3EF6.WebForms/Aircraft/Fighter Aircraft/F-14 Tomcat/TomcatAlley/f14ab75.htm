<P><H3>Block 75</H3>
<H4><P> This block introduced a modified air brake and beaver tail, which improved the aircraft's combat radius and subsonic cruise performance. The beaver tail was cut back (earlier F-14's had their dielectric panels on the beaver tail removed to give a similar shape and were modified to the new shape during overhauls) to the present shape. The airbrake was squared off and introduced a hump in its centre section. The change also saw the rear position light move from the beaver tail to the tip of the port vertical fin. BuNos:- </P>
