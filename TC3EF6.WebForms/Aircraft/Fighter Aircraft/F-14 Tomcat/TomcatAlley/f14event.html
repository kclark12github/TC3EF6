first F-14 prototype aircraft (BuNo 157980) made its maiden flight on the late
afternoon of 21 December 1970.  Grumman chief test pilot Bob Smythe was the pilot,
while project test pilot Bill Miller sat in the RIO's seat.  The aircraft took to
the air with wings fixed in the unswept (20&#186;) position and carried four dummy
Sidewinder missiles.  Due to poor weather and imminent sunset the flight was relatively
brief.  The uneventful first flight could not have prepared Grumman for what would
happen next.

<p>Nine days later on 30 December, prototype Number One went aloft for its second
flight--this time with Miller at the helm and Smythe in the back seat.  It left the runway at
1018, the landing gear was retracted after the control and stability checks were
performed.  The Tomcat proceeded towards the assigned flight test area.

<p>At around 1043, a chase plane noticed a trail of fluid was streaming from the
aircraft.  As the chase plane maneuvered to get a closer look, Miller reported a
primary hydraulic system failure; he immediately aborted the mission and
headed home.

When they were four miles from the Calverton runway, the pilots used the
emergency nitrogen bottle to blow down the landing gear.  Just then the unthinkable
happened--the secondary hydraulic system also failed.  Using the Combat Survival
System--a last-resort control system driven by an electrical pump and used to
control only the tailerons and rudders--Miller attempted to land the aircraft.  But on
the final approach, even this limited control system was showing signs of failing!  It had
become obvious to the crew that the aircraft was not going to make it
and it was flying into a dense forest just short of the runway.  They had no choice but to punch out.  
Smythe ejected when the aircraft was only a mere 25 ft above the trees, while Miller got out
less than half a second before impact.  Fortunately they suffered only superficial
injuries and both remained with the F-14 program.

<p>The ensuing official investigations showed that fatigue failures of the pipes in
both hydraulic systems which led to the partial failure of the flight controls was the
culprit.  But given the fact that the aircraft had suffered no combat damage, and
the two hydraulic systems were deliberately designed to be set wide apart, the chances
of failure in both systems were very remote.  After further investigation, Mike Pelehach 
and his team finally discovered the problem: When the engine was set to idle mode
during test flights, its idle RPM happened to be on the same frequency as the 
nine-cylinder pump which worked off the engine.  That exact frequency happened to be
the one that would cause the lines to naturally resonate, the pipes vibrated, developed
metal fatigue, then broke.  Since the secondary hydraulic system was built as a
mirror image of the primary, it too failed for the same reason.

<p>From that day on, the redundant hydraulic lines in aircraft would be implemented
differently--a lesson learned from that crash.

September 1976, an VF-32 Tomcat (BuNo 159588) made headline
news when its engines roared out of control while taxiing across the deck of <em>USS 
Kennedy</em> and the aircraft plunged into 1,850 ft of water, took along with it a
priceless Phoenix missile.  The crew ejected safely.  At the time of the event, the
<em>Kennedy</em> was operating in international waters and nearby Soviet naval
ships had witnessed the entire incident.

Fearing the Tomcat and its Phoenix missile may fall into Soviet hands, the Navy 
immediately began its recovery operation.  A ten-day sonar search by the first
wave of salvage vessels located the Tomcat, but adverse weather suspended
the recovery effort.  When the operation resumed, the aircraft was relocated but at
a different location.  Under the watchful eye of the Soviet ships, US Navy's 
nuclear-powered NR-1 research submarine went down to inspect the aircraft.  It
hooked a cable onto the Tomcat's undercarriage, then a British vessel attempted
to pull the aircraft to the surface.  The cable snapped, so a stronger line was used
on a second attempt, but the cable broke again!  Clearly a better equipped salvage
ship was needed.

<p>
While waiting for the proper recovery vessel to arrive, the NR-1 retrieved the
Phoenix missile which had become separated from the aircraft.  When the two West
German ships--<em>Taurus</em> and <em>Twyford</em>--arrived on the scene,
the operation resumed.  They made firm attachment to the wreckage, but this time instead of trying to winch it
to the surface at once, they lifted it half way up then slowly dragged the aircraft to shallow waters, from where it was carefully hauled to the surface.  The entire operation lasted
almost two months and cost two and a half million dollars.

<p>While one reason for such an expensive and time-consuming endeavor was the
need to examine the wreckage and determine the cause of the accident, it is
unquestionably true that the overriding concern was to prevent some of America's
most sophisticated weaponry from being compromised.
