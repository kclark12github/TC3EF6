<P>VF-211's origins trace back to VB-74, which was established upon the 
1st of May 1945. The squadron acquired it's present designation on the 
9th of March 1959. Before receiving the F-14A Tomcat VF-211 flew the 
Navy's last all gun fighter, the famous F-8J Crusader, becoming widely 
known due to their attractive and visible markings. However, the 
Crusader's days were number after the 23rd of December 1975, when 
VF-211 made it's maiden flight in the, at that time, brand new and 
highly advanced F-14A. VF-211 was the ninth squadron to receive the 
F-14A, following VF-124, VF-1, VF-2, VF-14, VF-32, VF-142, VF-143, 
and VF-114. Within six months VF-211 was flying the F-14A in that most 
difficult of Navy arts: carrier landings, the first taking place on the 
USS Constellation (CV-64) in June of 1976. The squadron's first cruise 
(with VF-24 as part of CVW-9) was also on board Constellation, 
beginning in April of 1977. Regular cruises on board Constellation 
followed, until in October 1980 VF-211 was selected to pick up the 
reconnaissance mission, with the "interim" TARPS pod. The original 
plans envisaged the introduction of a recon version of the F/A-18 
Hornet within a few years, but VF-211 (and the rest of the F-14 
community) are still performing this vital mission today.</P> 
<P>July of 1983 saw the first cruise on board another carrier, as CVW-9 
shifted to the USS Ranger (CV-61), due to the USS Constellation going 
into the Naval Shipyard at Bremerton to have a refit and update that 
would install the F/A-18 avionics and maintenance areas. VF-211 shifted 
again in 1985, this time to the USS Kitty Hawk so that Ranger could 
have the F/A-18 update. The Kitty Hawk cruise lasted from July to 
December of 1985. After this cruise VF-211 renewed it's association with 
the Constellation, then in early 1987 moved to the Kitty Hawk again, 
being aboard from January to June 1987. Following this cruise the whole 
of CVW-9 moved to the USS Nimtz (CVN-68), newly transferred from 
the Atlantic fleet. </P>
<P>In 1986 VF-211 took part in trials of experimental water based 
camouflage schemes, painting at least four aircraft in temporary schemes 
that consisted of browns and greys, three different shades of each 
colour being used. These paint schemes were found to weather fairly 
quickly and on different aircraft the underlying TPS greys and 
squadron markings could be seen to differing extents. The paint took 
around four hours to apply and ten to remove, resulting in some of the 
most interesting F-14 schemes to date.</P>
<P>VF-211 started to receive the upgraded F-14A+ (now F-14B) in April 
of 1989, for the first time being able to fly the F-14 to it's aerodynamic 
limits rather than it's engine limits. While VF-211, as with most Navy F-
14 units, may well have been eagerly looking forward to receiving the 
vastly superior F-14D, this was not to be. With the end of the Cold 
War and changing requirements the Secretary of Defence, Dick Cheney, 
halted all production of the F-14D, after only 55 had been produced. 
Instead, in 1992, VF-211 was forced to return to the F-14A, due to a 
decision to shift all F-14B's to Atlantic Fleet units. </P>
<P>VF-211 has received training for air to ground weapons and now 
routinely flys sorties with the aircraft primarily configured for air to 
ground attack, which while part of the original Navy specification for 
the F-14, was a capability which for a long time was left untapped. VF-
211 has received LANTIRN capable F-14's in small numbers, but the present lack of pods means they are not
presently fully operative in the LANTIRN roles. The squadron left NAS Miramar in 
August of 1996, and is now settled in it's new home at NAS Oceana. 
When required for cruises, all squadrons assigned to west coast 
carriers will now fly across the USA, but for administrative reasons will 
be under the command of COMNAVAIRLANT. </P>
<P>As mentioned above, during the 1970's VF-211 had some of the most 
visible markings around and even in the present era are some of the 
most attractive in the F-14 community. Today's VF-211 markings feature 
dark grey checks upon the rudder, twin dark grey horizontal lines at 
the top and bottom of the tailfin and the NG tailcode in small letters. 
Aircraft from the squadron are often seen with a black/dark grey anti-
glare panel that continues along the cockpit and down the spine of the 
aircraft. A second thin stripe is often used to highlight this area.</P>
<P>The images below show the first steps in the move from hi-vis to low-vis 
markings for VF-211. The first shows a VF-211 aircraft in the early gull grey/white camouflage scheme, 
with very hi-vis markings. The coloured stars on the tail represent the squadrons assigned to CVW-9.

<P>In this second image the white has gone from the camouflage and the tailcode has reduced in size. 
Later changes would see the red, white and blue tail markings replaced with grey, as would be the blue canopy hood and the red underfuselage strake.</P>
