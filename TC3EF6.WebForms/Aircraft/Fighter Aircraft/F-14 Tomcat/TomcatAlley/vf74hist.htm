<H3>VF-74 Bedevilers<BR>
Base:NAS Oceana<BR>
Tailcode:'AA'<BR>
Callsign:'Devil'<BR>
Variant:F-14B<BR></H3>

<P>The squadron now known as VF-74 was established on the 16th of 
April 1945 as VBF-20, then was redesignated as VF-10A on the 15th of 
November 1946, VF-92 on the 12th of August 1948. It finally became 
VF-74 on the 15th of January 1950. This was not the first Navy 
squadron to use the VF-74 designation. </P>
<P>As with most Navy fighter squadrons, VF-74 operated the F-4S 
Phantom II before converting to the F-14A Tomcat, training beginning 
in February 1983 while the first aircraft arrived in June. By October of 
the same year the squadron was fully operational with the F-14, and 
the first cruise began in April 1984 onboard the USS Saratoga (CV-60). </P>
<P>In 1985 VF-74 and VF-103 were thrust into the public eye, taking 
action in the fight against terrorism. On the 7th of October members of 
the PLO had hijacked the Italian cruise liner Achille Lauro. When the 
ship arrived in Syria the hijackers made their way to Egypt, where 
they had been promised free passage to Italy in return for the hostages 
lives (the Egyptians were unaware that the hijackers had already killed 
one hostage, the US citizen Leon Klinghoffer). Boarding an Egypt Air 
737 on the night of the 10th the hijackers probably assumed they had 
made their escape. However they had not planned on the US Sixth 
Fleet, which President Reagan now ordered into action. The Saratoga 
launched planes to intercept the 737 and force it down, where the US 
Delta Force would capture the hijackers. To this end four Tomcats and 
an E-2C Hawkeye were launched. Although reports conflict I believe two 
of the F-14's were from VF-74 and the other two from VF-103. After 
being vectored in by the Hawkeye the F-14's took up positions to port 
and starboard, ahead and behind of the 737. Once the 737 pilot realised 
what had happened he had little choice but to follow the F-14's to 
Sigonella in Sicily. When the plane landed the hijackers were arrested 
by the Italian police, rather than Delta Force. </P>
<P>1986 was an equally busy year with VF-74 taking part in two 
operations against Libya, Operation Prairie Fire in March and Operation 
El Dorado Canyon on the 15th of April.</P>
<P>The next few years saw VF-74 making regular deployments to the 
Mediterranean as part of CVW-17. </P>
<P>The early part of 1989 saw VF-74 receive the F-14A+ (now F-14B) 
version of the Tomcat and by the end of the year the transition was 
complete. The squadron leader, CDR Gus Grissom and RIO LTJG Bob 
McGee, became the first crew to launch an AIM-54A from the new 
version Tomcat. </P>
<P>The Bedevilers next call to action was in 1991 when they took part in 
Desert Shield/Storm. VF-74 and CVW-17 arrived in the Persian Gulf on 
the 7th of August, relieving the crews of the USS Eisenhower battle 
group. When hostilities broke out VF-74 flew many successful Combat 
Air Patrols (CAPs) only to find that the Iraqi Air Force unwilling to 
leave their Hardened Air Shelters (HAS).</P>
<P>After the Gulf War VF-74 continued to deploy at regular intervals and 
widened their range of skills by starting to incorporate air-to-ground 
weaponry in their repertoire. But the post Cold War cuts signalled the 
end for VF-74, the squadron disestablishing in April 1994. Thankfully 
VF-74 were able to celebrate their 50th anniversary before 
disestablishment. </P>
<P>Markings for VF-74 aircraft have remained remarkably consistent, 
perhaps because they were among the last East coast squadrons to move 
to the F-14, thus their aircraft were delivered in low vis markings. </P>
<P>These markings featured a red lightning bolt with a horned red face 
superimposed. Over the face is a sniper's sight picture. Below is an image of 
a VF-74 aircraft wearing an Su-27 style camoflage scheme. All VF-74 aircraft had a variation on this scheme applied during the squadron's last months of existence when it served as an unofficial aggressor squadron. At least one of these aircraft (BuNo.161432) was later used by VF-101 and VX-4 in the Su-27 scheme, although it is likely that is has since been resprayed to standard TPS greys.</P>

<P> Thankfully the Bedevilers markings have not finally disappeared with the 
disesatablishment of VF-74, as VF-101 has retained one aircraft in VF-
74 markings (and indeed has done so with aircraft from other 
squadrons). </P>
