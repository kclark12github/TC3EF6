<P><H3>Block 125</H3></P>

<P>BuNos:-</P>

<P>161599 Joe Baugher has two F-14's from this block that he does not have full details for, one is 16159?, so I assume it is 599, based on the fact that the USN&MC Directory includes it, as does Paul.  </P>

<P>161608</P>

<P>161610</P>

<P>161615 I believe this aircraft to be the other of the two conversions Joe Baugher is unsure about, once again based on the fact that it is listed in the two sources mentioned above. </P>
