<p>World War II changed naval strategies forever.  The aircraft carrier and its lethal
assortment of aircraft had replaced the battleship and its massive guns.  No longer
would opposing fleets line up in parallel columns and hammer away at each
other.  Battles could be waged without the combatants ever coming into sight of one another.

After the war the United States realized that it could never return to 
semi-isolationism and it would need a potent naval force to be able to
project its power world wide.  Thus despite their enormous costs, a fleet of
supercarriers were built beginning in the early 1950s.

<p>The Soviet Union on the other hand had no need to project its naval strength
outside of Europe.  Its biggest concern was to keep U.S. warships out of Soviet waters.  It
invested heavily in missile technology, thinking that the most effective way to fend off
a carrier battle group is to neutralize it with hordes of low-cost long range cruise missiles
carried by bombers or submarines before the carrier could sail within the striking distance of its aircraft.

The Navy became concerned by the Soviet advances in missile technology.  In
1959, the Navy launched its FADF (Fleet Air Defense Fighter) program, ordering the
Douglas F6D-1 Missileer fighter and its Bendix XAAM-10 Eagle air-to-air missiles.  From
the inception, the Missileer was intended to be a missile-launching platform; it would 
remain on patrol for a long period of time (up to six hours) and track targets with its
long range Hughes pulse-doppler radar.  If necessary, it could engage multiple
targets with the Eagle missiles at any given time.  Although the Missileer
showed some promise, its high cost, single-role limitation, and inability to defend itself
once all the Eagle missiles have been expended ultimately spelled its doom.  The
concept never left the drawing board and was cancelled in December 1960.

With the arrival of the Kennedy administration, a new man took over the
Department of Defense.  Robert McNamara was a business man and had a successful
business career with the Ford Motor Company before he head up the DoD.  He brought
with him a team of civilian <em>specialists</em>--engineers, accountants, analysts--and 
immediately started to re-examine many of the current military programs.  They
demanded that all the programs and their requirements must be justifiable
and most importantly, <em>cost-effective</em>.  These bright young men themselves had
absolutely no operational experience, yet they refused to acknowledge the importance of allowing 
the men in uniform into the process.  Consequently, the "whiz kids" ruthlessly axed valuable programs 
such as the Skybolt air-launched cruise missile and the XB-70 Valkyrie bomber and came up with 
many utterly inane ideas of their own.  One of those ideas would especially cause great 
concern for the Navy.

<a name="tfx"></a>  <!------------------bookmark---------------------------->
<p><a href="#top"><img src="" align="bottom" border="0" width=17 height=17></a><br>
At the time when Navy was looking for a replacement for its FADF program, the Air Force
was also shopping for a new strike fighter to succeed its F-105 Thunderchief.  Although 
the two services had distinct different requirements for their new aircraft, McNamara  and his 
entourage of <em>analysts</em> saw this as an opportunity to save some money and 
insisted the two to be merged to create a single TFX (Tactical Fighter Experimental) design.  
The result would prove to be disastrous for the Navy.

<p>By August 1961, the Navy reported to McNamara that a compromise
TFX design simply would not work.  First and foremost, the Air Force needed a
75,000 lb gross weight aircraft, while the Navy required the weight to remain 
below 50,000 lb.  Indifferent to Navy's pleads, McNamara <em>ordered</em>
 the Navy to accept a gross takeoff weight of 55,000 lb design.

<p>Six companies bid on the TFX project.  Despite the fact that both the Navy and
Air Force favored Boeing's design, McNamara selected the General Dynamics'
submission because <em>it placed greater importance on commonality</em>!
General Dynamics subcontracted the naval version (F-111B) to Grumman while
itself concentrated on the F-111A (the Air Force variant).  Unfortunately for the Navy,
they were stuck with a 63,500 lb design.

The first F-111B flew in May 1965, it had an appalling gross weight of <em>more
than 70,000 lb</em>!!  In addition to the weight problem, the F-111B also suffered from
the same engine and intake headaches which dogged the F-111A.  Subsequent trials
were quickly to show that on final approach, the aircraft had to be flown at such a high
angle of attack that pilot could not even see the carrier deck.  Its side-by-side seating
was equally unsuitable for a fighter/interceptor.  Attempting to reduce the weight of the
aircraft, it was subjected to no less than five WIPs (Weight Improvement Program.)  The
result wasn't very impressive.  All in all, the F-111B was one dog of an airplane.
Recognizing the F-111B wasn't the answer to Navy's
needs, Grumman commenced its study on a possible replacement fighter.

<a name="vfx"></a><!-----------------------------bookmark-------------------------->
<p><a href="#top"><img src="" align="bottom" border="0" width=17 height=17></a><br>
By October 1967 Grumman had a new proposal which wrapped a variable
geometry wing fuselage around F-111B's engines and weapons system.  New 
engineering methods and larger scale use of titanium and boron epoxy will be implemented 
on the new aircraft to minimized weight.  The project was designated 
VFX <font size="2">(yes, from which I got my name.  A very appropriate 
name for a Tomcat fanatic, in my opinion.)</font> by the Navy.

<p>In May 1968 the Congress refused to further fund the F-111B, effectively ending the program. Formal cancellation came seven months later.  By then the Navy was already concentrating its
efforts on the VFX program.  In July, the Navy issued a Request for Proposals calling for an aircraft to fulfill the basic VFX requirements.  Although Navy was very impressed with Grumman's new proposal, the company found itself had to compete with offerings from General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas, North American Rockwell, and LTV.  From the beginning, Grumman's early start and vast experience with naval aircraft gave it a big advantage over its competitors.  So confident was Grumman about landing this contract, it began building parts for the airplane months before the victory was assured.  In January of 1969, Grumman was declared the winner.

<p>One major force behind the effort to dump the inadequate F-111B and get the Navy a real fighter aircraft was VADM Thomas F. Connolly--the namesake of the F-14 <b>Tom</b>cat (<i>Tom's Cat</i>).  Vice Admiral Connolly had the fortitude to <a href="f14quote.html">tell it like it is</a> before a congressional hearing.  His testimony nailed the coffin shut for the F-111B, and gave birth to the F-14 Tomcat; at the time, VADM Connolly was on the verge of being promoted to an Admiral.  By speaking the truth, he sacrificed the fourth star and his future in the Navy.  At the same time, he saved the generations of naval aviators to come.  VADM Connolly retired as a Vice Admiral in September 1971.  Men of his integrity and courage are difficult to find these days.

Up until then Grumman had been out of fighter business for about ten years,
but its earlier XF-10F Jaguar experiment had given the company more knowledge
about variable geometry wing technology than anyone else.  Grumman engineers
performed 9000+ hours of wind tunnel tests on nearly 400 different combinations
of engine air intakes and exhast nozzles.  Out of the eight final design models,
model 303E was the one that landed the contract for Grumman.  It looked pretty much
like the definitive Tomcat, with the exceptions of it had only one vertical tail fin and
the single ventral strake was large and foldable.  The Navy didn't like the lone tail fin, 
because it might have problems in maintaining directional stability in the event of an 
engine failure at high speed.  Its tall profile required it to be folded for hangar
stowage aboard the ship.  The large folding ventral strake was also considered 
to be too complex and unsuitable for carrier operation.  Grumman addressed the
problems by replacing the tall vertical fin with two tails of lower silhouette and 
substituting two samller fixed strakes for the large and foldable one.

About 40% of the aircraft is made of aluminum alloy, 18% steel,
and 25% titanium.  Stronger than steel but significantly lighter, titanium is used to
manufacture among others, crucial parts of the complex swing-wing mechanism; such
as the wing box and wing pivots.  The Grumman engineers also pioneered
electron-beam welding.  It allowed them to weld thick sections of material (especially
titanium) together more quickly and efficiently.

<p>The F-111A was the first variable geometry wing aircraft to enter service in the
world.  Several of them were lost following the failure of their steel wing boxes.  To
make sure that F-14 does not follow F-111's foot steps, Grumman put the titanium wing
box through a series of punishing tests.  The box passed all the <em>tortures</em>
with flying colors.

On 25 October 1970 the first Tomcat was on its way to Grumman's flight test
facility at Calverton, New York.  Taxi trials started on 14 December of the same
year, and by the 21st it was ready to fly.  In the late afternoon,
with Grumman chief test pilot Bob Smythe at the control and project test
pilot Bill Miller in the back seat, the Tomcat made its maiden flight.  The entire
flight lasted only ten minutes and both pilots praised the big cat's pleasant
handling characteristics.  Nine days later on 30 December, the same aircraft took
to the air for its <a href="f14event.html#crash">second flight</a>. 
This time it crashed due to a catastrophic failure in both hydraulic systems.  Both pilots ejected safely and 
would remain on the program.

<p>The loss of the first prototype did not greatly affect the flight test program.  The second prototype flew on 24 May 1971.  Various phases of flight testing proceeded rapidly.  As additional aircraft joined the flight test fleet, the program picked up even more speed.  The 12th airframe was redesignated 1X to replace the original prototype. A total of <a href="f14pro.html">twenty</a> aircraft were
assigned to flight trials, each being assigned a specific role.  The integration and 
testing of F-14 and the AWG-9/Phoenix weapons system commenced in 
October 1971 at the Point Mugu Naval Missile Test Center.

<p>On 28 June 1972 the first F-14 landed on carrier <em>USS Forrestal</em> (CV-59).
The video tape of the landing was submitted to the Congress shortly afterwards.  After 
viewing the tape Congress gave F-14 its full endorsement.

The delivery of production Tomcats began in June 1972.  The Fleet Readiness
Squadron VF-124 Gun Fighters based at NAS Miramar, San Diego, Calif. was the first unit to 
receive the aircraft.  Two operational squadrons were established in October 1972 
to become the first Tomcat operators.  They were VF-1 Wolfpack and VF-2 Bounty
Hunters.  Their deployment aboard the <em>USS Enterprise</em> (CVN-65) two years 
later ushered in a new era in naval aviation.  The F-14 Tomcat was now fully operational.
