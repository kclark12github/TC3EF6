Tomcat's Baptism of Fire</h3>

In mid-August 1981, carriers <em>USS Forrestal</em> (CV-59) and 
<em>USS Nimitz</em> (CVN-68) were
conducting routine training exercise in the Gulf of Sidra.  The exercise was taking
place in waters over which Libya claimed territorial rights, therefore it was to the
surprise of no one that on the first day of the exercise, some 30 sections of Libyan 
fighters were intercepted and turned back by CAPing (Combat Air Patrol) Tomcats while they were attempting to "monitor" the event.  No shots were fired by either side.<p>

The next day--19 Auggain took position on CAP duty.  At 0715 two VF-0715 two VF-41
Tomcats--aircraft 102 flown by Cdr Henry Kleeman and Lt Dave Venlet, and aircraft 107
piloted by Lt Larry Muczynski and Lt Jim Anderson--picked up two fighters coming out
of the airfield they were monitoring and were heading straight towards them.  Initially
the Tomcats maneuvered to try to gain an advantageous position, but thanks to the
good work of Libyan GCI (Ground Controlled Intercept), the bogies were able to neutralize the Americans' attempts
by making counter-moves of their own.  The Tomcats decided to greet the 
intruders head-on.<p>

At the distance of 10 miles, Muczynski deliberately positioned his aircraft high above 
Kleeman's to provide top cover while the latter took the bogies right down the nose
to get a visual identification.  As the distance between them closed to 1,000 ft, 102 was
about 500 ft above the Libyan fighters--which now have been identified as Su-22 Fitters,
he then proceeded to roll his left wing down to pass directly above the section so he
could eyeball them.  As 102 maneuvered, 107 observed a missile leave the port side
of the lead Libyan fighter and was <em>streaking towards them</em>!  Fortunately it was immediately obvious that the missile had failed to guide properly and it sailed pass underneath 102.<p>

The <em>Rules of Engagement</em> the aircrew were operating under stated that
they may return fire if they were ever fired upon.  With that in mind, both Tomcats chased
after the lead Su-22.  Realizing that 107 was in good position to deal with the leader,
102 turned to the wingman instead.  Soon Cdr Kleeman and Lt Venlet found themselves
to be about 40&#186; off the Fitter's tail at a distance of three-quarters of a mile.
Kleeman squeezed off an AIM-9 and destroyed the aircraft.  The pilot bailed out.
Meanwhile, the lead Su-22 had just completed a climbing turn with Lt Muczynski
and Lt Anderson behind him in perfect firing position.  Muczynski also fired a
Sidewinder which flew right up the aircraft's tailpipe and blew off the entire aft section.
The pilot ejected, but no parachute was seen.<p>

The entire engagement lasted only 45 seconds.  <b>US Navy 2 : Libya 0</b>.

Angered Cats Strike In Self Defense</h3>

On 4 January 1989, two F-14s of VF-32 (AC-202 and AC-207)  flying out of carrier
<em>USS Kennedy</em> (CV-67) were on CAP over 
Mediterranean providing top cover for
exercising A-6s.  Around noon, an E-2 AEW (Airborne Early Warning) aircraft alerted the pair
that two bogies had taken off from Al Bumbah and crossed the beach headed 
their way.  The flight leader (AC-202) was given a vector to intercept them as the A-6s
departed the region and headed north.  The lead RIO (Radar Intercept Officer) acquired a radar contact at a distance of 70 miles away with an altitude of 8,000 ft.  From past experiences, Libyan fighters normally would turn away once they have been painted by F-14's powerful radar; but these two did not.<p>

The two Tomcats began to descend from 20,000 ft while building up their speed.  In the
ensuing minutes, as the F-14s executed a series of jinking turns designed to offset
the bogies and discourage them from advancing any further, the Libyan fighters countered the Americans' maneuvers move by move with the help from their GCI. 
After the first turn and sensing a hostile encounter was imminent, the Air Warfare
Commander on <em>Kennedy</em> gave the aircrew the <em>Warning Yellow and Weapons
Hold</em> signal, which meant that any action taken in self defence from this point
on is authorized.<p>

After the bogies have jinked into the lead F-14 for the fifth time, the lead
pilot directed the section to turn on the master armament switches.  At the range of
13 miles the lead fired an AIM-7 and immediately executed a 30&#186;
turn to the left.  The other F-14 followed suit with a similar turn to the right.  Quickly
both aircraft turned back into the MiGs and 202 fired another Sparrow.  At the same
time off to its right, 207 had also unleashed an AIM-7 of its own, which destroyed
one of the MiGs as it flew right into the intake duct and exploded.  The pilot ejected
and a good chute was seen.<p>

As the first Libyan fighter went down in flames, the lead F-14 pilot
performed a four and a half G turn to put himself on the tail of the remaining MiG and 
prepared to fire an AIM-9.  Strangely, the familiar Sidewinder growl was nowhere to
be heard!  Frantically, he switched to another missile station, still nothing!  With his RIO
screaming in the background and the distance between him and the MiG closing at a 
perilous speed, he attempted to use Sparrow instead.  But he was too close
to the aircraft in front of him for the Sparrow to do any good.  In desperation, the flight
leader switched back to the AIM-9 mode and reached down to the Sidewinder tone 
volume knob and started twisting it......
<b><em>a tone!  He got a tone!</em></b>  Apparently the damned thing
was accidentally turned off in the heat of the combat!  Without wasting another second
he squeezed off the missile and watched the MiG exploded into a great ball of fire.
The pilot managed to punch out safely.<p>

Less than seven minutes had elapsed between the initial call from the E-2 to the 
destruction of the last MiG.  <b>US Navy 4 : Libya 0</b>.

A Small Victory in the War Against Terrorism</h3>

On 7 October 1985, the cruise liner Achille Lauro was hijacked by PLO terrorists headed
by Mahammed Abbas while it was on a short cruise between the Egyptian ports of
Alexandria and Port Said.  Abbas demanded the Israeli government to release 
political prisoners, which included several known terrorists.<p>

During the incident, the hijackers killed an American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer, and
dumped his body overboard.  This cold-blooded act of savagery outraged Americans
worldwide.  Instead of trying to bring these perpetrators to justice, the Egyptian
government promised them a safe passage out of the country if they'd release the
rest of the passengers.  After the liner docked in Cairo, the terrorists boarded a chartered
Egypt Air Boeing 737.<p>

The White House ordered the Sixth Fleet to take action and approved a plan devised
by the Carrier Air Wing Commander Robert Brodzky.  Eight airplanes took off from the carrier <em>USS Saratoga</em>--four F-14A fighters (VF-74 and VF-103), 
one E-2C AEW aircraft, two KA-6D tankers, and an EA-6B EW airplane, all Grumman built aircraft!--to participate in the mission.<p>

The E-2C was positioned off the coast of Egypt and scanned the sky for departing airplanes from the Cairo airport.  The F-14As were positioned in a north-south
BarCAP (Barrier Combat Air Patrol).  Two nearby EC-135 and EA-3A monitored all electro-magnetic emanations from each radar contact and listened-in on the radio
transmissions.  Once the 737 had been identified, the EA-6B entered the picture.  It jammed all transmissions from the 737, effectively isolating it from the outside world.
The F-14s were then vectored to intercept it.<p>

The Tomcats approached the airliner with all lights extinguished, one of the F-14s had
to get as close as fifteen feet from the airliner to visually identify its markings!  
At this point, three more F-14s joined the silent hunt, and the E-2C began
to communicate with the airline crew.  When the pilots of the 737 refused to turn toward
Sigonella because they were intimidated by the terrorists, the E-2C proceeded to the
next step in the plan.  The F-14s were directed to move up beside and slightly ahead of the airliner, then at the command of the Hawkeye, they simultaneously switched on all their
external lights.  Imagine the sheer terror the people inside the 737 must had experienced when they finally realized that they were surrounded by what seemed to be
an armada of fighters!<p>

At that point, the pilots of the airliner had no choice but to obey the orders given to them.
The 737 finally landed at the Italian NATO air base at Sigonella, Sicily.  The terrorists
were swiftly taken into custody by the Italian officials.<p>

The Achille Lauro incident represents the most sophisticated and well-planned anti-terrorism operation ever undertaken to date.  The flawless execution of the operation is indicative of the professionalism of the men and women of the American armed forces.<p>

The Persian Gulf War</h3>

On 8 December 1990, aircraft carrier <em>USS Ranger</em> (CV-61) sailed from NAS North Island toward Persian Gulf.  Aboard that carrier was Carrier Air Wing Two (CVW-2) with its attachment of Fighter Squadrons One and Two (VF-1 and VF-2).  Around noon on 6 February 1991--three weeks after Operation Desert Shield became Operation Desert Storm, while flying top-cover for EA-6B Prowlers, a section of VF-1 F-14As were redirected by Red Crown to a new tasking.  The lead aircraft (BuNo 162603, coded NE-103) was flown by Lt Stuart "Meat" Broce with Cdr Ron "Bongo" McElraft in the backseat.  After a rendezvous with an Air Force KC-135 to top-off their fuel tanks, the two aircraft headed north.<p>

Soon the section was given a vector by a USAF E-3 Sentry to intercept a suspected bandit.  After visually identified the bandit--an Mi-8 Hip helicopter, the Tomcats greeted it head-on.  Lt Broce then turned around and chased down the helo.  When he got within firing range, he pitched up the aircraft to the left, rolled inverted, brought the nose back down to boresight the Hip, then he let loose an AIM-9  Sidewinder.  The missile made a direct hit and the helicopter erupted into a tremendous fireball.  This was the only Tomcat aerial victory of the short Gulf War, and it was one of the three air-to-air kills for the US Navy.<p>
