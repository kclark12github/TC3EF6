<H3>VF-101 Grim Reapers<BR>
Base:NAS Oceana<BR>
Tailcode:'AD'<BR>
Callsign:'Gunfighter'<BR>
Variants:F-14A, B, & D<BR></H3>

<P>While a squadron known as the 'Grim Reapers' did exist during WWII, 
they were disestablished in November 1945. Thus the lineage of the 
present squadron only goes back to 1952, when VF-101 was commisioned 
at NAS Cecil Field on the 1st of May. Initially the squadron was 
equipped with the FG1-D Corsair, although by the end of the year VF-
101 had moved to the jet powered F2H-1 Banshee. </P>
<P>VF-101 deployed with their new mounts to the Mediterrenean Sea, 
taking part in exercises in Southern Europe and the Middle East. </P>
<P>Another change in equipment came in August of 1956, when VF-101 
received the F4D-1 Skyray, their first radar equipped aircraft. </P>
<P>Just under two years later, in April 1958 VF-101 saw a change in 
role, when it was merged with the Fleet All Weather Training Unit 
Atlantic and moved from being a deployable unit to the training of all 
weather fighter pilots, both on the F4D-1 and the F3H-2 Demon. In 
becoming part of the training structure VF-101 became part of 
Readiness Attack Carrier Air Wing 4. </P>
<P>June 1960 saw VF-10 enter a new era, when Detatchment "A" was 
created at NAs Oceana to operate the F4H-1, later F-4B, Phantom II. </P>
<P>By the end of 1962 both the Skyray and Demon had been phased out 
and in February of 1963 Detatchment "A" was disestablished, F-4 
training moving to NAS Key West. </P>
<P>The 1st of May 1966 saw another detatchment formed at NAS Oceana, 
taking over the roles of training replacement pilots and RIO's in the 
areas of aerial refuelling, carrier qualification and conventional 
weapons. The Key West unit concentrated upon air-to-air combat, 
missile firing and radar intercept techniques. </P>
<P>In August of 1967 VF-101 introduced the second generation of the F-
4, the F-4J, to squadron service. VF-101's administrative command, 
Readiness Attack Carrier Air wing Four, was diestablished on the 1st of 
June 1970, with VF-101 shifting to the control of Command Fleet Air 
Key West, but this move lasted less than a year, the Grim Reapers 
moving to the control of Commander Fleet Air Norfolk in February 1971. 
By April of that year the move from NAS Key West was completed, with 
a detatchment remaining at Key West. VF-101's third change of control 
happened in July, when they moved under the command of Commander 
Fighter Wing 1. </P>
<P>January 1976 saw the beginning of VF-101's time with the F-14, when 
it started training Tomcat air and groundcrew as well as those for the 
F-4. The first F-14 conversion class began in June to support VF-41 
and VF-84 in their move from the F-4N to the F-14A. </P>
<P>1975 and 1976 saw VF-101 pick up the CNO Aviation Safety Awards 
and in November of '76 the squadron had received its fourth Safety 
Citation due to 36 continuous months of without air or ground accident. </P>
<P>With the increasing number of F-14 units in the fleet it was decided 
to form separate units for both F-14 and F-4 training. Thus on the 5th 
of August 1977 VF-101 was split into two squadrons, VF-101 to continue 
F-14 training on the East Coast while a new squadron, VF-171, was 
created to carry on F-4 East Coast training. VF-171 lasted in this role 
until 1984, when, with the withdrawl of the F-4 from active fleet units 
it was disestablished. </P>
<P>In 1986 VF-101 completed another 3 years of accident free operations, 
earning it another Safety Citation.</P>
<P>A third CNO Safety Award was presented to the squadron in March of 
1988, this year also saw big changes at VF-101, the squadron being the 
first to receive the new F-14A+ (now F-14B). The new variant cured 
the F-14's most serious problem, that of sensitive and troublesome 
engines, the previous TF-30's being replaced by GE F110's, which 
offered a 14,600 lbst increase over the F-14A. Even more importantly 
the F110 improved fuel economy of the F-14B, giving it one third more 
time on station and sixty percent more range. As well as the engines 
the F-14B featured an upgraded fire control system, the Hughes AWG-
15F, the ALR-67 Threat Warning and Recognition System, a gun gas 
purge system, an ARC-182 UHF/VHF radio system, A Fatigue/Engine 
Monitoring system (FEMS) and a Direct Lift Control/Approach Power 
Control system (DLC/AFC MOD). The F-14A's wing glove vanes were 
deleted, as their effect was found to be minimal.</P>
<P>On the 12th of September 1990 VF-101 opened another new door for 
the F-14, dropping MK-84 2,000lb bombs. In part this and other efforts 
were motivated by a desire to persuade policy makers to restart F-14 
production, but led to the F-14's increasing role as a Strike Fighter 
rather than a pure air-to-air platform. The present VF-101 weapons 
training encompasses a whole range of air-to-ground weapons, from iron 
bombs, cluster munitions, mines, flares, laser guided munitions and air 
launched decoys as well as air-to-air weapons. </P>
<P>After VF-124 was disestablished in 1994 VF-101 took over its training 
role, creating a detatchment at NAS Miramar to train crews and ground 
personnel on the F-14A and D. The aircraft assigned to Miramar all had 
modex nos in the 200 series, while the Oceana unit used those in the 
100 series. As nearly all West Coast F-14 squadrons have now moved to 
NAS Oceana the VF-101 detatchment has returned there too, moving 
back in September of 1996. Now all F-14 training, for all three variants 
is carried out at NAS Oceana, although VF-101 still maintains its NAS 
Key West detatchment for ACM training. </P>
<P>The future will see VF-101 continuing to train the next generation of 
F-14 crews, with the training syllabus changing to accomodate the 
LANTIRN and NVG upgrades that are spreading throughout the fleet. </P>
<P>At first VF-101's markings were similar in style to VF-32, featuring a 
large central tail band with thinner ones above and below it. However 
the VF-101 aircraft had their central band in red, with the thinner 
ones in blue. The 'AD' tailcode was in black, shadowed with gold. 
The image below shows a VF-101 F-14A in the markings of the late 1970's/early 1980's.</P>

<P>As colour schemes toned down the coloured bands and shadowing of 
the tailcode were removed. The early 1980's saw the 'AD' shift to the 
rudder, on all over grey aircraft it was in black, but TPS grey aircraft 
had it in dark grey. At some point a 'Grim Reaper' was added to the 
scheme, showing a scythe armed skeleton swooping down. The squadron 
number has varied, at times being seen at the bottom of the rudder and 
at others on the under engine strake. </P>
<P>Today VF-101's markings have an enlarged Grim Reaper that fills the 
entire outer surface of the tail. The tailcode has been moved to the 
inner surface of the rudders.An example of these markings can be seen below.</P>

<P> Several VF-101 aircraft also feature the markings of disestablished squadrons, among them VF-1, VF-24, VF-33 and VF-74. These aircraft all carry the 'AD' code on the inner rudder. A feature peculiar to both VF-101 and VF-124 during their careers seems 
to be that many of their aircraft featured oversized modex numbers on 
their noses, I believe this continues today. </P>

<P>As the only F-14 RAG left VF-101 has expanded considerably in the last 
few years and now generally has around 130 F-14's of all three 
variants in service. It also uses a small number of T-34C's for 
currency training and range control work.</P>
