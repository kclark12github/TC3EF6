The powerful AN/AWG-9 fire control system is the heart of the F-14's weapons system.  From the start, it was developed to control the long range Phoenix missile, with accommodations for the AIM-7 Sparrow, AIM-9 Sidewinder, and M61 Gatling gun as well.  It can detect and track up to 24 targets--anything from a sea-skimming cruise missile, to a high-flying bomber--at ranges over 100 miles, and simultaneously attack 6 of them with missiles.<p>

The radar can operate in several modes: PS (<i>pulse search</i>), PSTT (<i>pulse single target track</i>), PDS (<i>pulse doppler search</i>), RWS (<i>range while scan</i>), PDSTT (<i>pulse doppler single target track</i>), and TWS (<i>track while scan</i>), among others.  The TWS mode is what gives the Tomcat its unique capability to engage multiple targets at once.  In this mode, 6 different targets can be picked out, and using time-sharing techniques, a Phoenix missile can be guided against each one of them.<p>

As capable as the AWG-9 is, it is old analog technology from the 60s.  Its reliability and maintainability leave something to be desired.  With the advent of the F-14D Super Tomcat, a digital version of the radar emerged to take the AWG-9's place--the Hughes AN/APG-71.<p>

The APG-71 represents a major overhaul on the basic AWG-9 system; only the power supply, transmitter, and the backseat RIO's TID(tactical information display) are retained from the old radar.  It has imcreased detection and tracking ranges, improved ECCM (electronic counter-countermeasures) capabilities, and a state-of-the-art analog-to-digital converter.  The data processing speed also sees a six-fold improvement thanks to a better data processor.  New radar modes allow BVR (beyond visual range) target identification, the ability to distinguish closely-spaced targets, and distortionless ground mapping.<p>

For passive, long range search, the APG-71 can be linked to the IRST (infrared search and track) chin pod carried by the F-14D.  The radar is much more reliable than its predecessor, and being the beneficiare of technology developed for the USAF's APG-70 radar, its maintainability is also improved.

The M61A1 Vulcan is a six-barreled 20mm Gatling gun that has been in service for the last 30 years.  Many modern US tactical aircraft all carry the Vulcan gun as their standard internal armament--including F-4, F-111, and the teen fighters.<p>

The Tomcat usually carries the gun with 675 rounds of ammunition. The gun muzzle and assembly are located on the port side of the forward fuselage.  Originally, gas-purging vents were fitted around the gun.  But they had a tendency to vent gun gases into the intakes and cause problems for those temperamental TF30 engines.  These vents were later replaced by a more efficient diffuser system, which is consisted of three triangular air scoops around the weapon.  After firing, instead of ejecting them overboard, the empty cases are returned to the drum for storage.

In the 1950s three types of Sparrow missiles were developed, with Sparrow III (the designation for AIM-7C and onward) being the most successful and massly produced; its development continued until recent years.<p>

The AIM-7 uses semi-active radar homing guidance, which means after launch, the aircraft must keep the target illuminated with its radar, otherwise the missile will not be able to lock-on.  The Sparrow's performance in actual combat have always been very poor.  Its dismal showing in Southeast Asia spurred the development of AIM-7E-2 and AIM-7F.  The AIM-7F variant is almost a complete redesign of the original missile.  It featured solid-state electronics, and increased warhead size, and a more powerful rocket motor.  The AIM-7M, with its improved ECCM and look-down/shoot-down capabilities, represents a further refinement on the F model.<p>

In the 1991 Gulf War, the Sparrows redeemed itself by being responsible for 69% of the total Iraqi ait-to-air losses.  Nevertheless, the missile will eventually be superseded by the AIM-120 AMRAAM; though the F-14 will most likely be stuck with AIM-7s for the remainder of its operational career.<p>

The Tomcat can carry up to six Sparrows--four underneath the fuselage and one on each of the wing glove pylons.

The AIM-9 Sidewinder is the most widely used air-to-air missile in the western world--just about every major western fighter and attack aircraft, even a few helicopters, can carry this simple, yet very effective infrared homing missile.<p>

The AIM-9L is the first all-aspect version of the missile, which means it is no longer limited to engaging the enemy aircraft from the rear quarters, thanks to a more sensitive heat seeker.  The Lima also has better tracking stability than its predecessors, and a more potent warhead.  The AIM-9M offered a few improvements over the previous version:  It uses a lower-smoke motor and has better ECM resistance and background discrimination ability.<p>

The Tomcat carries up to four Sidewinders, two on each of the wing glove pylons.

The AIM-54 Phoenix is the longest ranged and most sophisticated air-to-air
missile in service anywhere in the world.  Along with the powerful
AWG-9/APG-71 fire control system, they give the Tomcat unmatched long range punch.<p>

The Phoenix has a built-in pulse doppler radar and is capable of transmitting 
and receiving radar signals independent from the launching aircraft; 
thus making the AIM-54 a <i>fire-and-forget</i> missile.<p>

The AIM-54A was the first production model of the missile.  It had analog
electronics, liquid-cooled hydraulic and thermal conditioning system.  AIIM-54C
offered significant improvements over the A model:  Digital processors replaced
the analog electronics, better target discrimination and ECCM ability,
greater maneuverability, and increased lethality.  When the F-14D Super Tomcat
entered service, a slightly improved version of the AIM-54C was developed
for it--the AIM-54C+.  The C+ is no longer required to draw temperature cooling
liquid from the mother aircraft, it also features a high-power transmitter adopted
from the AIM-120.<p>

Although no Phoenix has ever been fired in combat, during peacetime testings 
and trainings, it has proven itself to be the most potent air-to-air missile around.  
The F-14 can carry up to six of these missiles--four on adaptor pallets mounted 
underneath the fuselage and one on each of the wing glove pylons.

In the late 1970s when the RA-5C and RF-8G dedicated reconnaissance platforms had begun to be phased out of service, the TARPS (<i>Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System</i>) was developed as an interim solution to Navy's recce needs until the planned RF-18s became available.  The F-14's high speed, long range, and good agility made it an ideal platform to carry the TARPS.<p>

Housed in the front end of the pod is a two-position (vertical and forward oblique) KS-87 frame camera.  Behind the frame camera is a KA-99 low-altitude panoramic camera.  Next in line is the AAD-5 imaging infrared sensor.  These sensors make the TARPS a very effective low-to-medium altitude reconnaissance system.<p>

The pod is carried under Tomcat's weapon station #5 (the right rear Phoenix station).  It poses minimal penalty on aircraft performance and makes little demand on the aircraft, only power, signal, and environmental control connections are required.<p>

The system entered service with VF-84 and VF-211 in 1981.  With the retirement of the last RF-8G Crusader in early 1982, TARPS-equipped F-14s became the fleet's principal tactical reconnaissance system, and will most likely remain so into the 21st century.
