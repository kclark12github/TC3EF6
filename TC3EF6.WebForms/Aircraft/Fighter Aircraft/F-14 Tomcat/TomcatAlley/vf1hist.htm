<H3>VF-1 Wolfpack<BR>
Base:NAS Miramar<BR>
Tailcode:'NE'<BR>
Callsign:'Wichita'<BR>
Variant:F-14A<BR></H3>

<P>Established on the 14th of October 1972 at NAS Miramar, at the same 
time as VF-2, the squadron received it's first F-14As on 1st July 1973. 
Squadron markings take the form of a stylised wolf's head, either red 
(for the CAG and boss bird) or low vis grey. </P>
<P>The squadron made the first Tomcat cruise on USS Enterprise (CVN-65) 
from September 1974. The end of this cruise saw the Tomcat's conflict 
debut, as VF-1 and VF-2 flew air patrols over Saigon in April 1975 to 
cover the final evacuation of US personnel. </P>
  <P>During 1976 and 1977 VF-1 (along with VF-2) took part in trials of 
prospective new camouflage schemes for the Tomcat. While I am unsure 
as to how many aircraft were actually repainted, one I definitely know 
about is BuNo. 158979, at the time VF-1's CAG bird. The scheme was 
devised by aviation artist Keith Ferris in an attempt to break up the 
aircraft outline. Due to it's look it became known as "splinter" scheme. 
While it was originally intended to make the aircraft less visible, I 
believe that trials showed it to have the opposite effect, the sharp 
edges and high contrast in the pattern actually making aircraft more 
visible! The colours used were dark grey, FS36118, on the top and 
tails, with a medium grey, FS36231, on the top and bottom surfaces. 
The remainder of the aircraft, the sides and areas of top and bottom, 
were painted in a mix of light grey, FS16440 (90%),  and white, 
FS17875 (10%). An image of the colour scheme can be seen below.</P>

 <P> VF-1 then changed from CVW-14 to CVW-2, entailing a move of 
carrier to the USS Ranger (CV-61) in September 1980. The squadron 
flew several successful cruises then shifted to USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) 
for a single cruise in 1984. In 1984 VF-1 achieved the impressive total of 22,000
hours of flying without accident. By 1986 VF-1 had returned to Ranger and 
was still with the carrier when she participated in Desert Storm in 
1991. A plane from the squadron scored the F-14's only air to air kill 
of the war when NE-103 (BuNo.162603) shot down an Iraqi Mil Mi-8 Hip 
using an AIM-9 Sidewinder.</P>
 <P> With the decommissioning of Ranger in 1993 the squadron was left 
without a carrier assignment and so operated out of NAS Miramar. I 
believe at one point the squadron was due to convert to the F-14D 
Super Tomcat, however, due to a lack of airframes and the Navy's 
decision to reduce the number of F-14 squadrons per carrier from two 
to one, VF-1 was disestablished on the 1st October 1993.</P>
<P>Traditionally VF-1's markings have been very colourful, reflecting the Wolfpack theme strongly.  
Below can be seen an image of their CAG aircraft in an early, full colour scheme. At this time the 
tailcode was carried on the inside of the vertical tails. The later low vis schemes removed almost 
all of the colour, until in the end all that was left was the wolf's head on the tail in low vis grey. At 
times the tailcode was carried behind the wolf's head, between the horizontal lines on the outisde 
of the tail, while other periods saw it shifted to the more usual inside tail position.</P>
