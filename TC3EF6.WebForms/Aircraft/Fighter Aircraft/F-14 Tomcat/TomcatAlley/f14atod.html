If the F-14A has a fault, it is the Pratt & Whitney TF30-P-412A turbofan engine.  It is prone to compressor stalls and doesn't produce enough power to justify its glutton appetite for jet fuel.  With 20,900 lb of wet thrust, even two of these engines could not produce adequate power to push a 70,000 lb (full combat load) fighter around.  What's
even worse, it had a nasty tendency to shed turbine blades!  The later P-414 variant
offered very little improvement, if any at all.
The TF30s are extremely unreliable and have accounted for about 28% of all F-14 crashes.  

<p>Despite its problems, the TF30 was chosen because it was the only available engine at the time and waiting for a more suitable engine to emerge would've caused extensive delay to the progem.  Navy's plan was to use it as the powerplant for the prototype, trials and evaluation aircraft, plus the first 67 production examples, while the Navy evaluated the intended replacement--the Pratt & Whitney F401.

One F-14A airframe were converted to serve as prototype aircraft for the F-14B program.  The prototype was fitted with two Pratt & Whitney F401-P-400 engines; each produced 28,000 lb of thrust with afterburner.  The F401 was a variant of the P & W F100-PW-100 engine used by the USAF's F-15 Eagle, and later by the F-16 Fighting Falcon.  In addition to providing 30% more power than did the TF30, the F401 also weighed less.  The F-14B first flew in Dec. 1973.  But due to technical difficulties and escalating costs, the program was cancelled and the sole F-14B was placed in storage.

<p>Starting in 1982, as F-14s came in to the lot for scheduled maintenance and overhaul, they were fitted with a new variant of the TF30 engine--the P & W TF30-P-414A.  The 414A produced the same amount of thrust as the 412A and actually is a little heavier than the latter.  But it was more reliable and used less fuel.  The biggest problem it suffered from was that it produced smoky exhaust which made the aircraft easy to spot in combat.  Knowing this was still an interim solution, the Navy continued to search for a better powerplant.

The introduction of a new generation of Soviet fighters convinced the Navy that it could no longer put off the task of finding an engine that would do the F-14 justice.
In 1981 the F-14B was dusted off and used as the testbed for the General Electric F101 DFEs (Derivative Fighter Engines.)  These engines offered 27,000 lb  of wet thrust each and consumed far less fuel than did the TF30s.  They were later redesignated the GE F110-GE-400 engines and in July of 1984, a contract was given to Grumman to install F110s in the F-14B prototype.  The flight tests followed were proven to be highly successful and gave Navy the impetus to go ahead with the F-14A+.

F-14C was an updated development of the F-14B proposed by Grumman.  It was to have upgraded avionics--which included increased computer memory and a progrmmable signal processor, Honeywell laser-gyro inertial navigation system, an improved radar and fire control system, a TCS (Television Camera Set), and a non-cooperative target identification system.  Its projected hight cost prompted the Navy to order more A-6 Intruders and look for a low cost alternative -- which resulted in the VFAX program.  However, all of F-14C's proposed features were later incorporated into the late production F-14As.  The F-14C remained a paper version.

The heart of the F-14A+ is the new power plant: two General Electric F110-GE-400 engines.  Since it is a variant of the F110-GE-100 used by F-15s and F-16s, it retained some 80% parts commonality with the USAF's engine.  Its 35% increase in thrust enabled the F-14A+ to be catapulted off the carrier deck in military power and brought the thrust-to-weight ratio to almost unity in full combat load.  Its care-free handling
characteristics is a fighter pilot's dream come true.  Tomcat pilots can finally
fly the aircraft itself instead of having to fly the inferior engines.

<p>In addition to the F110 engines, a Fatigue/Engine Monitoring System, Direct Lift Control/Approach Power Control module, ALR-67 Threat Warning and Recognition system, ARC 182 UHF/VHF radio installation, AWG-15 Hughes Radar Fire Control System and a gun gas purge system were all parts of the F-14A+ upgrade.  Later on, the gun gas purge system was to be implemented on all F-14s.

<p>The production of the F-14A+ began in March of 1987, carrier suitability testing started in April 1988 aboard USS Independence.  VF-101 and VF-74 were the first two F-14A+ operators.  The F-14A+ is the fighter that F-14 should have been from the very beginning.

The F-14D is the latest, and perhaps the definitive version of the Tomcat.  It uses the same engine as the F-14A+, and features advanced digital avionics, instrumentation, an even more powerful radar, and a dual optical/electronics chin pod, which houses both the TCS and IRST (Infrared Search and Track) system.

<p>Despite its proven prowess, the AWG-9 radar carried by the F-14A and F-14A+ is old analog technology from the 60s.  The news Hughes AN/APG-71 radar used by the F-14D, with its high speed digital processing, offers a six fold improvement in information  processing over the AWG-9.  It also has improved ECCM (Electronic Counter Countermeasures) capability.

<p>Besides the new radar, the digital avionics upgrade also enhance the F-14D's capabilities considerably.  These state-of-the-art digital electronic equipments include two AN/AYK-14 mission computers, programmable digital displays and controls, ASN -139 digital inertial navigation system, and ALR-67 RWR (Radar Warning Receiver.)  The JTIDS (Joint Tactical Information Distribution System) allows an F-14D to pass on its radar generated information to other "silent" Tomcats.

<p>Cockpit upgrades include MFDs (Multi-Function Displays), and HOTAS (Hands-On-Throttle-And-Stick) "switchology".  A new triple-redundant digital AFCS (Automatic Flight Control System) will replace the analog AFCS.

<p>The F-14D is also cleared to carry a number of advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons; including the AIM-120 AMRAAM, Mk. 80 series iron bombs, AGM-78 ARM, Rockeye cluster bombs, and other laser guided munitions.

<p>Without a doubt, F-14D is the most lethal fighter/interceptor in the world.  It is truly a shame that only a handful was procured by the Navy due to <em>
budgetary constraints</em>--actually politics had more to do with the decision than
anything else..

Sensing the Navy was experiencing difficulties with the N/ATF (Naval Advanced
Tactical Fighter) program, Grumman proposed the Tomcat 21--a private venture of the
company--to the Navy.  With the cancellation of the N/ATF, the hopes
were high for the Tomcat 21.

Tomcat 21 would have been an aircraft that is even more advanced than the
F-14D.  It would feature new, more powerful and fuel efficient engines, the ability
to <em>supercruise</em> (the ability to travel at supersonic speed without using
the afterburners), reduced RCS (Radar Cross Section) by extensive use of
composite meterials, and advanced ground-attack capabilities with provision for
AGM-84 Harpoon, AGM-84E SLAM (Stand-off Land Attack Missile), AGM-65
Maverick, and the usual Mk. 80 series iron bombs.

<p>
Although it was only a paper airplane, the Tomcat 21 was an aircraft with 90% of
the requirements of the N/ATF for about 60% of the cost of a totally new aircraft.
Unfortunately the Navy decided to go with the F/A-18 E/F and terminated
F-14D program and any other possible F-14 upgrades.  The Hornet proponents
in the Navy and DoD had it their way.  That decision could very well be a big mistake.
Only time will tell...
