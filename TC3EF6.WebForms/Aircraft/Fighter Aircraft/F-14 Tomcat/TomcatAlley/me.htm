<CENTER><H3>So just who is this Tomcat loving nutter?</H3></CENTER>

<P>For those of you interested here is a short biogrpahy of myself and for those with a really strong disposition 
a picture of me to view.<BR>
David Davies is curently a third year student at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, studying 
International Politics and Strategic Studies. While Aberyswyth (or 'Aber' to its inhabitants, much
easier to pronounce when you've had a few beers : ) is hardly a well known town, the Department of International 
Politics is world reknowned. Whilst studying here I've had the opportunity to take modules on such diverse subjects as
the Cuban Missile Crisis, the British Army since 1945, Intelligence and National Security, International 
History, the Arab-Israeli wars, International Political Theory Today, Warfare in the 20th Century and Strategy in the 
Nuclear Age. <BR>
When I'm not studying (most of the time actually) I can often be found glueing my fingers together while attempting to 
put together something vaguely resembling an aircraft model. When I tire of that I write HTML for this page 
(as you can all guess I have WAYYYYY too much free time upon my hands :), cruise the World Wide Web or indulge in
another of my favorite pastimes-pizza. <BR>
Every once in a while, when feeling energetic, I take a wander around the beautiful welsh countryside. 
Aber is a seaside town and some of the sunsets are quite stunning. Hopefully I'll put some images of them up soon.<BR>
Apart from that I do very little, sleeping, eating and watching TV. <BR>
