<H3>VF-2 Bounty Hunters<BR> 
Base:NAS Miramar<BR>
Tailcode:'NE'<BR>
Callsign:'Bullet'<BR.
Variant:F-14D<BR></H3>

<P>Established at NAS Miramar at the same time as VF-1 the squadron 
completed crew training and received it's first F-14s in July 1973.   
Squadron markings in the 70's were among the most colourful of all F-14 
units. They composed a blue rudder with two white stars, the 'NE' 
tailcode and a blue/white/red sash on the forward fuselage, known as a 
"Langley Stripe", in reference to the markings carried by aircraft 
flying from the first ever US navy carrier, the USS Langley (CV-1). 
Most recent markings seem to be a small 'NE on the rudder and a skull 
on the tail.</P>
<P>As with VF-1 the squadron flew top cover over the Saigon evacuation 
in Operation Frequent Wind. The squadron formed the TARPS unit for 
both CVW-14 and CVW-2, deploying aboard USS Enterprise (CVN-65) at 
first, then switching to USS Ranger (CV-61) where they stayed till 
1993, apart from a single cruise aboard the USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) in 
1984. Along with VF-1, VF-2 took part in trials of the "splinter" 
camouflage in the late 1970's. The CAG bird, BuNo. 158985, was the 
only plane repainted as far as I know. For more information please see 
VF-1 history. </P>
<P>During it's time as an F-14 operator VF-2 has been highly successful 
in the various awards it has collected. These include 3 COMNAVAIRPAC 
(Commander of Naval Air Forces Pacific) Battle "E"s during the 1980's. 
A Battle "E" signifies the squadron is the most efficient in the Pacific 
fleet. VF-2 also won 3 Boola-Boola awards between 1985 and 1987, a 
prize given to the squadron that accumulates the most points on it's 
annual missile shoot. The coveted Mutha trophy was also won 3 times, 
an award presented to the best F-14 squadron in the Pacific fleet. VF-2 
has also won awards in the West Coast TARPS, Fighter Derby, ECCM 
and High Noon Gunnery competitions.</P>
<P>The squadron became the first to launch an F-14 from an aircraft 
carrier while towing an air to air gunnery target, this event occurring 
on 2nd of June 1984. In 1987 the squadron logged Ranger's 260,000th 
landing. As with VF-1 the unit took part in Desert Storm aboard USS 
Ranger, the carrier being one of two forward deployed into the Persian 
Gulf. Unfortunately the squadron did not have the opportunity to 
engage any Iraqi targets and had to be content with escort, recon and 
CAP missions, playing an important part in ensuring the safety of Navy 
bombers to and from targets. </P>
<P>When Ranger was decommissioned in 1993 the squadron was left 
without a carrier. In 1994 it was decided to make VF-2 one of only 
three squadrons that would be lucky enough to upgrade to F-14D Super 
Tomcat. Having completed the transition the squadron was assigned to 
the newly refurbished USS Constellation (CV-64) and as of March 1994 
was completing carrier qualifications along with the rest of CVW-2.</P>
<P>After their 1995 cruise Vf-2 returned to NAS Miramar, but were only 
in residence for a few months before beginning the process of moving to 
the new home of almost all F-14 Tomcat squadrons-NAS Oceana. The 
move began in April of 1996 and was completed within a relatively 
short space of time. To commemorate the event VF-2 painted it's CAG 
bird (modex 100) in the 1970's camouflage scheme, a welcome change from 
the ever present low vis schemes of today. </P>
<P>Once at Oceana VF-2 began training in earnest for their next 
deployment. During the later stages of this period the Bounty 
Hunters gained F-14's modified to carry the LANTIRN laser 
designation pod, giving them an all weather precision strike 
capability. Not all squadron aircraft were modified, the usual 
being 9 out of 14 (the others being the TARPS capable aircraft in 
F-14A & B squadrons, although all F-14D's are TARPS capable). </P>
<P>Once all training was complete Vf-2 deployed onboard the USS 
Constellation once more, beginning a WESTPAC cruise that will last 
several months. The ship and squadron have recently made a port 
visit to Australia (May 1997) and are featured in the May issue of 
AirForces Monthly.</P>
<P>The image below shows the earliest style of VF-2 hi-vis markings, 
emphasising just how much today's markings are toned down. </P>
