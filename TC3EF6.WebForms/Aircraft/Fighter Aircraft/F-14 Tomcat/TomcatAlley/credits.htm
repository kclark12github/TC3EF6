<P> If you're impressed by this page then these are the people to thank, not me. I simply assembled all that was given to me.
These people are the ones who have provided the facilities, the knowledge, the pictures, the stories and most importantly the large
amounts of patience necessary to deal with my questions. Some of these people probably live in fear of the phrase "I've just one 
more question, if you don't mind........"  While some have provided more help than others, everyone's contribution has been important, 
thus this list is arranged in alphabetical order, not in any order of importance.<BR>
Many others not on this list have also contributed, pointing out my errors, providing recollections and tidbits of information. A
complete list would take up huge amounts of space so I'd just like to express my gratitude to them also.</P></H4>
<P>If you think your name should be on this list please <A HREF="add@premier.co.uk.html>">e-mail</A> me so that I can correct the oversight.
The same goes if you would like your entry on this page changed in any way.</P> 

<P><A HREF="http://www.awacs.demon.co.uk/">Paul Abadesso</A> provided the images from the NAS Miramar 1994 airshow and huge amounts of data on F-14 serials and where they all are now. Without him the F-14 block
pages would be much emptier.</P>

<P><A HREF="Torsten.Anft@post.rwth-aachen.de.html>">Torsten Anft</A> for squadron information and pictures. Torsten is also the author of the fine artwork now featured in 
all my squadron histories.</P>

<P><A HREF="DAKOTA204@aol.com.html>">Scott Bilyou, </A>formerly a plane captain with VF-142, has provided all manner of information on the F-14A PLUS and Navy life. </P>

<P><A HREF="http://pages.ripco.com/~bones">Bones</A> has provided some fine F-14 images and future versions of the page will see more of his work appearing.

<P>Dorian Dogaru and all at <A HREF="yaap.html">YAAP </A>
for giving me space to bring this creation to life. While it may have seemed a good idea at the time they probably suffer nightmares
about it now. :) Extra thanks to Dorian for all the wonderful animations he has created for this page.</P>

<P>James C.Kao for giving me space at <A HREF="index4.html">Tomcat's Lair</A> to start my F-14 ramblings. James has also contributed some fine F-14
pictures to the picture galleries.</P>

<P><A HREF="heyjoe@wbbinc.com.html>">Dave Parsons,</A> a former F-14 pilot, has been very kind in allowing me to use some images from his excellant book "Fighter Country-The F-14 Tomcats of NAS Oceana".

<P><A HREF="bplescia@U.Arizona.EDU.html>">Brian Plescia</A> has provided information on colour schemes and units, the mammoth Hasegawa model kit review and some wonderful images which were planned to be online by now.
However the university scanner is still broke, so they haven't made it into the latest update. As soon as I can they'll be in. He's looking for old pals from VF-24, VF-31 and other F-14 units, so if you know him give him a mail.</P>

<P>Nigel Pretty has contributed data on F-14 squadron assignments, that will be used in future editions of squadron pages.</P>

<P>Troy Quigley for telling me all there is to know about the F-14. </P>

<P><A HREF="rainman@inetworld.net.html>">Lt Dave Raymond, USN,</A> has provided several fine images for the archives and squadron data.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://nanaimo.ark.com/~dshaw/">Darryl Shaw </A>for all his wonderful US Navy unit patch scans and some fine images of Navy aircraft.</P>
