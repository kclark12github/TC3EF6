<p>There were a total number of twenty F-14 aircraft assigned to flight
trials,  each one had a specific role.  The following is a summary of the prototype aircraft
and their assigned tasks.

<table border="4" width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3">

<tr>
<th>Aircraft</th>
<th>Assigned Role</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 1</td>
<td>The original prototype.  It made F-14's maiden flight on 21 Dec. 1970.  Nine days
later it crashed during its <a href="f14event.html#crash">second flight</a>.  A leakage in the hydraulic fluid caused the crash.  It was intended for envelope expansion flights and high speed testing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 2</td>
<td>Assigned for low speed, high lift, and stall/spin tests.  For these tests its wings were
fixed in 20&#186; (unswept) position and the air inlets were locked in fully open 
configuration.  It also performed the first 68&#186;-wings landing tests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 3</td>
<td>It was used to clear the airframe to fly at specified G-loadings (7.5G in the ground
attack role and 6.5G for the interceptor job.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 4</td>
<td>The first aircraft to leave Grumman.  It was delivered to Naval Missile Test Center at
Pt. Mugu, California in Oct. 1971, where Hughes Aircraft installed and tested the AWG-9
fire control system and AIM-54 Phoenix missiles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 5</td>
<td>Delivered to to Pt. Mugu to be used for systems installation, test and compatibility
work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 6</td>
<td>Also delivered to Pt. Mugu where it was used for missile separation and weapons
system compatibility work.   The aircraft was lost in an accident in June 1973, when a warheadless 
AIM-7E missile pitched up seconds after being launched and struck the Tomcat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 7</td>
<td>The sole F-14B aircraft.  Assigned to flight test the Pratt &  Whitney F401 engine.  It flew in Sept. 1973 with one TF30 and one F401 engine.  After the cancellation of the F401
the aircraft was put into storage.  In 1981 aircraft No. 7 was taken out of storage and
used as the testbed for the General Electric F101 DFE engine.  Later on it became an
F-14D trials aircraft.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 8</td>
<td>It was used for drag-reduction tests, JBD and catapult trials at Lakehurst, New Jersey.  It was also the first F-14 to dogfight the F-4J.  The Phantom took a mauling from the Tomcat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 9</td>
<td>It was assigned to evaluate and test the F-14 avionics at Pt. Mugu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 10</td>
<td>Grumman used it for structural validation tests.  Later it was taken aboard a carrier
for catapult launch and arrested landing trials.  On 30 June 1972, with Bill Miller (one of the pilots who'd flown the ill-fated aircraft No. 1) at the helm, it struck the water when Miller
made a technical oversight while practicing for an upcoming airshow.  Miller died in
the crash.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 11</td>
<td>It was hoisted aboard the aircraft carrier <em>USS Independence</em> and underwent handling tests on the flight deck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 12</td>
<td>After the crash of the original prototype, aircraft No. 12 was redesignated as
1X and took over No. 1's flight test duties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 13</td>
<td>Grumman mounted No. 13 within an anechoic chamber to test the
electromagnetic compatibility of the Tomcat's avionics suite, ensuring that each
individual component did not interfere with one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 14</td>
<td>It carried out the maintenance and reliability demonstration work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 15<br> No. 16</td>
<td>Used for pilot training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 17</td>
<td>This aircraft replaced the crashed No. 10 and continued the carrier
compatibility trials.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 18<br> No. 19</td>
<td>Used for pilot training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No. 20</td>
<td>It performed climatic tests in the weather hangar at Pt. Mugu.</td>
</tr>
