<P><H3>Block 65</H3>
<H4><P> This block introduced the TF30-P-412A engine, a modification of the original TF30 designed to reduce the problems of compressor stall, turbine blade cracking and to improve containment of any blade failures. This was only the first of several variants of the TF30, each of which was progressively better at solving these problems. Apart from this I know of no differences between block 65 and block 60 aircraft.  BuNos:- </P>
