<H3>VF-31 Tomcatters<BR>
Base:NAS Miramar<BR>
Tailcode:'NK'<BR>
Callsign:'Tomcat'<BR>
Variant:F-14D<BR> </H3>

<P>At sixty-one years of age VF-31 is the second oldest continuously 
active US Navy aircraft squadron. Originally established as VF-1B on 
1st July 1935 the squadron received it's current designation in August 
1948. While there had previously been other VF-31's there was no direct 
link between them and today's VF-31.</P>
<P>Before converting to the F-14 the 'Tomcatters' had a notable history, 
being the only US squadron (of all three air arms) to score confirmed 
kills in three wars, World War II, Korea and Vietnam.</P>
<P>VF-31's association with their namesake, the F-14 Tomcat, began in 
late 1980, but they did not receive their first F-14 until the 22nd of 
January 1981. In a short time, however, they had received their full 
complement and officially stood up with the F-14 on the 4th of June 
1981. As with all squadrons at this time VF-31 received the F-14A. </P>
<P>The squadron's first cruise was onboard the USS John F. Kennedy 
(CV-67) as part of CVW-3, beginning in January 1982. By September of 
1983 VF-31 was to embark on it's fourth cruise onboard Kennedy. This 
cruise took the carrier and it's air wing back into the southern 
Mediterranean, more specifically off the North African coast. It was on 
this cruise that VF-31 crews regularly flew over Lebanese and Syrian 
positions, often being fired at by Syrian AAA, which had little chance 
of hitting the fast and high F-14's. However on a flight in early 
December (perhaps the 3rd?) a more serious threat emerged, SA-7 heat 
seeking SAMs were fired at the F-14's. Although both the Tomcats 
(standard procedure for recon missions was one bird with the TARPS 
pod and another to fly on it's wing, providing cover against possible 
air threats)flying were able to return safely this action led to US Navy 
retaliatory air strikes. On the 4th of December attack aircraft from both 
Kennedy and USS Independence (CV-62) attacked the SAM sites, 
but this time there were losses, one A-7 and one A-6.</P>
<P>VF-31 shifted carriers and air wings in April of 1985, moving to 
become part of CVW-6 onboard the USS Forrestal (CV-59), along with 
it's sister squadron VF-11. Cruises onboard Forrestal continued until 
early 1992, when Forrestal became the US Navy's replacement for USS 
Lexington (AVT-16) as a permanent training carrier. </P>
<P>This prompted a series of big changes for VF-31, the squadron 
changing coasts, carriers and planes all in one go! Moving from NAS 
Oceana to NAS Miramar VF-31 became part of CVW-14 onboard the USS 
Carl Vinson (CVN-70). However the biggest change was in terms of 
planes, VF-31 (and VF-11) trading their A model F-14's for the new 
and improved D. The D Tomcat has a huge increase in capability over 
the A, featuring new engines, radar and ejection seats. </P>
<P>VF-31, like all F-14 squadrons, is presently in the process of 
receiving LANTIRN capable Tomcat's, although the small number of pods 
purchased so far means that at present they have to be shared amongst the 
fleet </P> 
<P>As with sister squadron VF-11, VF-31 moved to NAS Oceana in 
January/February of 1997.</P>
<P>VF-31's markings are among the most famous of F-14 squadrons, 
featuring the Felix the Cat, who was created by Emile Chourre. The 
markings tend to feature a running Felix clutching a bomb on which the 
fuse is burning down. Felix has been featured on a number of 
backgrounds, while with F-14A's the background tended to be bright 
red (an example of which can be seen below), but with the shift to F-14D's and
low vis camouflage now tends to be seen on a grey background. </P>

<P>VF-31's CAG aircraft has had a chequered history in the last few years, 
undergoing several changes of markings. November of 1994 aircraft '200' 
had little in the way of special markings, simply featuring Felix in a 
yellow circle and a rainbow at the base of the tail. The CO of the unit at 
this time, CDR Randy "Pogo" Clarke was persuaded to liven it up somewhat. 
So the rainbow flash was enlarged and now ran from the front base of the tail
to the rear edge. Felix was increased in size and put on a larger yellow 
background. Tragically, not long after being painted in these markings 
this aircraft and another from VF-31 collided in midair. Although all 
four crewmembers were safely rescued the aircraft now reside in the Pacific.
Undetered VF-31 repainted their new '200' aircraft in the same markings about
one month later. Before leaving for their 1996 Western Pacific cruise 
VF-31 decided to improve the markings even more, adding an all black tail and
a bright yellow 'NK' tailcode on the inner surfaces. Excellant pictures of
all these schemes can be seen in the F-14D photogallery.</P>


<P>The table below shows the aircraft assigned to VF-31 at different points in time. In theory as the table builds up you will be able to track which aircraft have served with VF-31 and for approximately what time period. The code "N.P." means the aircraft was not present at that date. The 06/96 data is not a complete listing of aircraft attatched to the squadron. <BR>
