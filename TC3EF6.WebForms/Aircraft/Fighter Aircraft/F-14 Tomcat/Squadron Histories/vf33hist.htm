Base:NAS Oceana<BR>
Tailcode:'AB'<BR>
Callsign:'Tarbox'<BR>
Variant:F-14A<BR></H3>
   
<P>Established in September 1943, VF-33 were first equipped with the 
Grumman F6F "Hellcat". Their first operation was to the Soloman 
islands, the first time a US Navy squadron has used the F6F in combat. 
VF-33 was land based at this time, supporting the island hopping 
Pacific campaign. VF-33 disestablished in July 1946.</P>
<P>VF-33 was re-established on the 11th of October 1948, this time flying 
the famous Chance-Vought F4U "Corsair". After seeing action during 
the Korean war (and being awarded the Navy Unit Citation for their 
success) several changes of equipment and location followed in  quick 
succession. By 1962 the unit was flying F8U-2NE "Crusaders" from the 
world's first nuclear powered aircraft carrier, the USS Enterprise 
(CVN-65) and as part of this team took part in the blockade of Cuba.</P>
<P>In 1964 the squadron started to become familiar with the aircraft 
which (in two different versions) would last them the next 17 years and 
became the backbone of Naval Fighter Aviation. The plane was, of 
course, the F-4 "Phantom II". Initially equipped with the F-4B, VF-33 
set a new Atlantic Fleet record by winning the CNO Aviation Safety 
Award for four years in a row (1961-64). However VF-33's time with 
the F-4B was short and in 1967 they upgraded to the F-4J. The new F-
4 featured a different radar, higher thrust engines, slatted tailplanes, 
extra fuel cells and larger main wheels (to handle the increased 
weight). </P>
<P>Almost as soon as the new F-4's were received VF-33 was once again 
deployed to combat, this time to South-East Asia onboard USS America 
(CV-66). During their time in theatre VF-33 dropped over 3,000,000 
pounds of ordnance! This was in the space of 4000 combat hours flown 
over 5 months. On the 10th of July 1968 a VF-33 bird downed a MiG-
21C, the first air to air kill by an East Coast Fighter squadron over 
N.Vietnam. </P>
<P>After returning from Vietnam VF-33 continued it's association with 
CVW-7 and USS Independence (CV-62), deploying most years. Several 
awards were won during this time, including the CNO safety award in 
1969 and 1970. The 75-76 cruise saw the squadron win the Golden 
Tailhook Award, recognising it's skill at carrier landing. February 1979 
saw VF-33 achieve 3 years of accident free flying. </P>

<P>In 1981 VF-33 entered a new era, with the introduction of the F-14A 
Tomcat. As the transition took place VF-33, who up until this time had 
the official squadron name of "Tarsiers", began to unofficially use their 
callsign, "Starfighter" as the squadron name, perhaps inspired by the 
huge increase in capability the F-14A brought. </P>
<P>VF-33's first deployment with their new mount was between August 
and October of 1982 onboard USS America (CV-66).  </P>
<P>Another AIRLANT record fell to VF-33 on the 20th of August 1985, as 
the squadron became the first to complete 50 missile firings without a 
single failure, testimony to the skill of VF-33's Ordnance and IWT 
shops, part of the AV-ARM division.</P>
<P>Another deployment onboard USS America (CV-66) as part of CVW-1 
began in March of 1986, this time headed for the southern 
Mediterranean. VF-33 and VF-102 provided air cover for the carrier 
battle group as it moved south of Colonel Ghaddafi's "Line of Death" 
(Ghaddafi claimed that Libya's territorial waters extended 12 miles from 
the Libyan coast, as opposed to the internationally recognised limit of 3 
miles. Any plane or ship crossing that line was thus within Libyan 
waters, Ghaddaffi claimed, and thus liable to attack). </P>
<P>On the 15th of April 1986, after a terrorist attack on a west German 
disco hall, President Reagan ordered airstrikes against targets within 
Libya. F-111F bombers, from the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW), 
based at RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom, attacked targets in Tripoli, 
while Navy A-6's from the carriers America and Coral Sea attacked 
Benghazi harbour. Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18A Hornets and Navy 
A-7E's attacked Sam sites with HARM missiles. The Tomcat squadrons 
provided aerial cover for the entire strike force.</P>
<P>Also in 1986 VF-33 flew 895 continuous sorties without an abort, a 
record that stands within the F-14 community to this day.</P>
<P>1987 began with a short cruise onboard the Navy's newest carrier, 
USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71), allowing CVN-71 to shake down 
prior to full introduction to service. </P>
<P>1987 also saw the unit officially become known as 'Starfighters', it's 
previous official name being 'Tarsiers', with the then commanding 
officer, CDR Tony Bucchi, designing the new squadron patch. The 
squadron members had unofficially referred to themselves as 
Starfighters for several years prior to this.</P>
<P>As part of their flawless missile record VF-33 launched an AIM-54 
Phoenix off the oldest active east coast F-14, BuNo 159010, an 
impressive achievement considering the complexity of the Tomcat's AWG-
9 radar system. </P>
<P>Two more cruises onboard USS America followed, one in 1988 and one 
in 1989. February of 1990 saw VF-33 (and presumably VF-102) switched 
to CVW-9 onboard the USS Constellation (CV-64) for a two and a half 
month transit from San Diego to Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The time 
was put to good use, however, with VF-33 performing several joint 
exercises with South American nations. Once in Philadelphia, 
Constellation began her Service Life Extension Programme (SLEP).</P>
<P>Late 1990 saw the arrival of the Gulf crisis, as part of the 
multinational force deployed to the area VF-33, onboard USS America 
(CV-66) helped enforce the sanctions then participated in Operation 
Desert Storm, providing air cover to Navy and allied aircraft. </P>
<P>After the success of Desert Storm VF-33's days were numbered. In 
October 1993 the squadron had the dubious honour of being the first F-
14 squadron to be disestablished in the recent round of cuts. This was 
due to the Navy move from 2 F-14 squadrons per air wing to 1. </P>
<P>VF-33's markings have followed several  styles since the introduction 
of the F-14. Two high visibility aircraft have featured black tailfins, 
with the star and lightning bolt being outlined in yellow. The air wing 
code was carried, for the most part, in yellow on the insides of the 
rudders. These two aircraft were an F-14A loaned from VF-101, used to 
display VF-33 markings before the squadron received it's own F-14's. An image of 
one of these aircraft can be seen below.</P>

<P>The second aircraft was VF-33's first CAG bird, nose modex 201, 
unofficially known as "the Batmobile". This aircraft carried these very 
high visibility markings until late 1984, when it suffered a serious 
accident and was not returned to VF-33 until 1988. During it's rebuild 
the squadron had received low vis markings.</P>
<P>An interesting feature of these two high vis birds was a lightning 
bolt running from the air intakes to the modex. Once again this was 
yellow, outlined in black. Unfortunately it's use was discontinued 
sometime after 1982.</P>
<P>Low vis aircraft featured the same design of tail markings, but had 
no background colour, the star and lightning bolt simply being outlined 
in grey, with yellow highlighting inside. The tailcode (again on the 
inside of the rudder) was dark grey. In mid 1985 only two aircraft 
were painted this way, the CAG and boss birds (modex nos 200 and 
201, BuNos 161142 and 161151 respectively). </P>
<P>All the other aircraft featured solid black stars and yellow lightning 
bolts, outlined in dark grey, once again with the airwing code on the 
inside of the rudder in dark grey. </P>
<P>As VF-33's aircraft were sent back to NARF (Naval Air Rebuild 
Facility) they came back in the very low vis scheme, with no yellow in 
the lightning bolt or black in the star.</P>
<P>Finally in the early 1990's some VF-33 aircraft featured a low vis 
variation on the "Batmobile" scheme, with low vis tail markings and a 
dark grey lightning bolt on the forward fuselage.</P>
 <P>At the VF-33 disestablishment ceremony in October of 1993 one of the 
squadron's last aircraft featured a large image of VF-33's mascot, 
"Minky", on the inside of the port vertical tail.</P>
