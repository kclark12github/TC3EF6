<H3>VF-11 Red Rippers<BR>
Base:NAS Miramar<BR>
Tailcode:'NK'<BR>
Callsign:'Ripper'<BR>
Variant:F-14D<BR></H3>

<P>VF-11 converted from the F-4 Phantom to the F-14A in 1980. The 
squadron, while having the same insignia and tradition as the original 
Red Rippers, cannot claim their lineage as the original Red Rippers 
were disestablished  on 15th of February 1959, one day before the 
present VF-11 stood up. Squadron markings consist of a boar's head 
above a dark blue shield on which is a thunderbolt and two circles.</P>
<P>VF-11's combat debut occurred on the 4th of December 1984. The 
squadron flew combat air patrols over a US Navy strike force. 
The strike was in response to Syrian anti-aircraft fire directed at VF-
31 Tomcats the previous day. Unfortunately two of the twenty-eight 
strong attacking force were shot down in the course of the raid. 
However neither of these were from VF-11, the losses being one A-7E 
from VA-?? (USS Independence) and one A-6E from VA-75. The A-7E 
pilot was rescued, but one member of the A-6E crew died on impact, 
while the other was held prisoner by the Syrians for a year, then 
released. </P>
<P>After cruises on Kennedy the squadron shifted air wings and 
carriers, joining CVW-6 on board USS Forrestal (CV-59), staying with 
this carrier until December 1991 when Forrestal replaced USS Lexington 
(AVT-16) to become the training carrier. VF-11 then moved from  NAS 
Oceana to NAS Miramar, picking up F-14D's in the process. At present 
the squadron is assigned aboard USS Carl  Vinson (CVN-70) with CVW-
14. While many of the Navy's F-14 squadrons have been disestablished 
VF-11 is to escape the axe, instead it has been decided that CVW-14 
will remain with two F-14 squadrons onboard. </P>
<P>In 1994 VF-11 added another upgrade to the F-14, giving it the 
capability to use NVG's (Night Vision Goggles). These literally allow 
pilots to see in the dark, replacing instrument flying with a clear (but 
green tinted) view of the world around them. While having their 
limitations, NVG's provide a big leap in night time capability, especially 
in roles such as precision night bombing, forward air control and 
combat search and rescue, where accuracy and being able to correctly 
identify the target are essential.</P> 
<P>The NVG's are mounted onto the pilot's helmet and flip up out of view 
when not needed. As NVG's multiply available light hundreds of times 
changes had to be made to the F-14's internal and instrument lighting, 
which if left at their normal level would blind pilots wearing NVG's. 
Thus VF-11 developed a set of filters and lenses to fit over F-14 
cockpit instruments and controls to allow the flight crew to change 
between normal and NVG lighting. </P>
<P>Unusually the VF-11 NVG system was developed in house by the 
squadron, rather than first being tested by Naval test and evaluation 
squadrons. This has saved much time and money over normal methods. 
Up until 1996 the squadron only had one modified Tomcat, but by the 
time the squadron deploys to the western Pacific it will have 6 aircraft 
with the NVG system installed. Long term Navy plans envisage the 
system being fitted to all F-14's, hopefully providing an excellent 
complement to the LANTIRN night vision and targeting system that is 
slowly being introduced into the fleet.</P>  
<P>VF-11, as with all but one Pacific fleet F-14 squadrons, has 
moved to NAS Oceana. This happened after their 1996 cuise 
onboard the Vinson was completed, with both VF-11 and VF-31 
arriving at Oceana in the first two months of 1997.</P>
<P>Soon after arriving at NAS Oceana VF-11 started to convert from 
the F-14D Tomcat to the less capable F-14B. This move was 
necessary due to the limited numbers of F-14D airframes in the 
fleet, which has made it impossible to support 3 active squadrons, 
the RAG and various test units. VF-11 had completed conversion by 
May 1997 and has also acquired a number of LANTIRN modified 
airframes, althoug they have yet to receive the pods themselves. 
The next scheduled deployment of the Red Rippers will be as part 
of CVW-7 onboard USS John C. Stennis. </P>  
<P>Markings for VF-11 aircraft have been fairly low key, generally featuring the 
squadron insignia as represented on the patch at the top of this article. At times the 
boar's head has been included while at other times it is absent. In general, while assigned the F-14A,
VF-11's markings took the form represented in the image below. A few cruises featured the 'AE' 
tailcode on the inside of the tails, while most saw it on the outside.</P>

<P>When VF-11 transitioned to the F-14D its markings became even more low-vis, now the squadron insignia 
is generally in dark grey, without the boar's head, while the present tailcode of 'NK' is carried on the inside of the vertical fins. 
However the squadron, as with all Navy squadrons, is allowed to paint two aircraft in "display" markings and these feature VF-11's markings in full 
colour.</P>  
<P>As of mid 1996 VF-11 had the following F-14D airframes 
assigned, with the conversion to F-14B none of these are any 
longer with VF-11, but I have no newer information at present.</P>

<P>This list is incomplete, as I do not have the data as to which 
aircraft wore the modex's 112, 113 and 114. Any help filling this 
gap would be appreciated. If anyone has the squadrons new serials 
for their F-14B's that information would also be most appreciated.</P>
