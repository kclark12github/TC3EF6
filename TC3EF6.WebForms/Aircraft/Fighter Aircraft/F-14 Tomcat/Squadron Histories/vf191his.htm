<H3>VF-191 Satan's Kittens<BR>
Base:NAS Miramar<BR>
Tailcode:'NM'<BR>
Callsign:unknown<BR>
Variant:F-14A</BR></H3>

<P>VF-191 and sister squadron VF-194 were the two shortest lived F-14 squadrons in history and 
are thus unfamiliar to many observers. The original VF-191 took part in WWII and the Korean conflict, but was disestablished in 1978.
Thus while the VF-191 established on the 4th of December 1986 can claim the unit's name and markings it did not have the heritage of VF-191.
After training with VF-124 and being due to deploy onboard the USS Independence as part of CVW-10 VF-191 was disestablished
before the cruise could take place. </P>
