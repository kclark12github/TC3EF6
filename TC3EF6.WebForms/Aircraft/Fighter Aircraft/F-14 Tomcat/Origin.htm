<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Grumman F-14 Tomcat
carrier-based interceptor fighter is a relatively elderly design
by contemporary world standards, but continual developments and
improvements have maintained its capabilities to the extent that
it is still a potent threat and an effective deterrent to any
hostile air force unwise enough to threaten US Navy carrier
battle groups. Its mix of air-to-air weapons is unmatched by any
other interceptor type, and its radar is the most capable
long-range airborne interception radar carried by any fighter
today. With its mix of weapons, it can attack any target at any
altitude from ranges between only a few hundred feet to over 100
miles away. A total of 556 F-14As were procured for the US Navy,
while 80 roughly similar machines were purchased by the Iranian
government before the downfall of the Shah. The improved F-14B
and F-14D have been built and deployed by the Navy in modest
numbers. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Grumman Aircraft
Corporation of Bethpage, Long Island had dominated the market for
US Navy carrier-based fighters ever since the early 1930s,
creating one successful design after another. The FF, F2F and F3F
biplane fighters, the F4F Wildcat and F6F Hellcat monoplane
fighters of the Second World War, and the postwar F8F Bearcat and
the jet-powered F9F Panther and Cougar fighters had dominated the
decks of Navy carriers for nearly three decades. However, by the
mid-1950s the Grumman company seemed to be running out of gas and
was beginning to lose its edge over its competitors. In 1953, the
company's Design 97 proposal, a single-seat fighter powered by a
single Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 turbojet, lost out to the Vought
F8U Crusader. The Design 118 project, a two-seat missile-armed
interceptor powered by a pair of General Electric J79 turbojets,
had initially been ordered by the Navy as the F12F- 1, but was
cancelled in favor of the McDonnell XF4H-1 Phantom in 1955 before
any aircraft could be built. Even the successful Design 98 (F11F
Tiger) had its production career cut short in favor of more
Crusaders for the Fleet. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In the early 1960s, In
search of more business, Grumman had collaborated with General
Dynamics in the development of a carrier-based escort fighter
version of the TFX, the F-111B. The F-111B had the same
swing-wing geometry as did the F-111A Air Force tactical fighter
version, but was equipped with a Hughes AN/AWG-9 long range
search radar and was armed with a battery of six Hughes AIM-54
Phoenix long-range air-to-air missiles. It was powered by a pair
of Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30 turbofans. However, as the 1960s wore
on, the F-111B began to encounter some severe difficulties,
especially with an ever-increasing weight. In spite of herculean
efforts on the part of Grumman, the weight problems ultimately
proved to be incurable, and the axe finally fell in May of 1968,
when the US Congress refused to fund F-111B production,
officially terminating the program. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Even before the final
cancellation took place, Grumman management had seen the
handwriting on the wall with the trouble-ridden F-111B program.
They concluded that they had better have some sort of alternative
project in mind should the F-111B project end up being cancelled,
lest the successful Grumman line of Navy fighters come to an end.
Consequently, even before the F-111B project was officially
terminated, Grumman began work on a company-funded project known
as Design 303. The basic goals of Design 303 were to combine the
particular aptitudes of the F-111B with capabilities that would
be superior to those of the McDonnell F-4 Phantom, particularly
in the air superiority, escort fighter, and deck-launched
interception role. At an early stage, Grumman decided on a tandem
rather than a side-by-side seating arrangement for the two crew
members. The armament was to consist of a mix of Sparrow
semi-active radar homing missiles, Sidewinder infrared homing
missiles, and Phoenix long-range missiles. A built-in 20-mm
rotary cannon was to be included as standard equipment. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">On June 18, 1968, only a
month after the F-111B project was cancelled, the Navy issued a
request for Contract Definition Phase proposals in search of an
alternative. The RFP issued to the industry a month later
specifically mentioned a requirement for a fleet defense fighter
with tandem two-seat crew accommodations, a mix of short, medium,
and long-range missiles, an internal cannon, two TF-30 turbofans,
and track-while-scan long-range radar. The new fighter was to be
capable of patrolling 100-200 miles from its carrier, remaining
on station for up to two hours. A secondary close support role
was also envisaged for the aircraft, and the plane was to be
capable of carrying up to 14,500 pounds of bombs. Maximum speed
was to be Mach 2.2. Grumman, General Dynamics, Ling-Temco-Vought,
McDonnell Douglas, and North American Rockwell submitted bids.
Four out of five of the submissions were for variable-geometry
designs. In December 1968, Grumman and McDonnell Douglas were
selected as finalists. Grumman had the inside track in this
particular contest, and was announced as the winner on January
14, 1969. The designation F-14 was assigned. Grumman was awarded
a research, development, test, and evaluation contract on
February 3, 1969. During fiscal year 1971, contracts were signed
for 12 prototypes and 26 production aircraft. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The project which Grumman's
design team, led by Mike Pelehach, had submitted was for a
two-seat, twin jet aircraft with the pilot and weapons system
officer seated in tandem under a single elongated canopy. The
powerplant was to be a pair of afterburning Pratt &amp; Whitney
TF30 turbofans, which had also powered the abortive F-111B. </font></p>
