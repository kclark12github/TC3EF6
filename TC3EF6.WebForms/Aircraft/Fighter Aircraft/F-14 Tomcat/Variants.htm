History</b></font></h1>

<hr>

<h2><a name="F-14B"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>F-14B</b></font></a></h2>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Almost from the start of
the Tomcat project, Grumman was aware that the TF30-powered F-14A
would be somewhat underpowered. On February 27, 1970, almost a
year before the first flight of the F-14A, Grumman had suggested
that a Tomcat derivative be built powered by the winner of the
Advanced Technology Engine competition, the two contestants being
the General Electric GE1/10 and the Pratt &amp; Whitney JTF22.
The Navy wrote up an new requirement (which they named VAX-2)
which would eventually lead to a new designation of F-14B being
assigned. It was anticipated that the F-14B would have 40 percent
better turning radius, 21 percent better sustained g-capability,
and 80 percent greater radius of action. At this stage of the
Tomcat project, the F-14A was considered only an interim type,
pending the introduction of the definitive F-14B. It was also
proposed that all existing F-14As be brought up to F-14B
standard. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The winner of the engine
contest was the Pratt &amp; Whitney entry, which was later
redesignated F401-P-400. This engine was a derivative of the
JTF22 Advanced Technology Engine, which had also spawned the F100
turbofan that was used by both the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle
and the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The F401-P-400
offered 16,400 pounds of thrust dry and an afterburning thrust of
28,000 pounds. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The seventh Tomcat (BuNo
157986) was set aside to serve as the prototype. It flew for the
first time on September 12, 1973 with the F401-P-400 engine. With
the new engine, the thrust-to-weight ratio of the F-14B was
raised to greater than unity, offering a much improved
performance. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Original plans called for
the F-14B to start rolling off the production line with the 67th
production edition, with earlier F-14As being converted to F-14B
configuration when sufficient numbers of F401s became available.
However, the development of the F401 turbofan soon ran into
serious trouble, and failed its initial flight rating tests.
Since the F-14A had already encountered severe cost overruns, and
since the Navy's budget had been severely cut back at the end of
the Southeast Asia war, the Navy decided to stick with the
TF30-powered F-14A, and plans for the production of the F-14B
were abandoned in April of 1974. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Following the cancellation
of the F-14B, 157986 was put into storage. It was brought out of
storage in 1981 for evaluation of the General Electric F101 DFE
engine, paving the way for the development of the F-14A(Plus) and
F-14D versions. </font></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="F-14C, never built"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>F-14C, never built</b></font></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b> </b></font></h2>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The F-14C was to have been
a version of the F-14B fitted with upgraded avionics system that
provided for all-weather attack and reconnaissance capability.
Like the F-14B, the F-14C was to have been powered by a pair of
F401-P-400 turbofans. However, the high costs of the F-14C caused
the Navy to order more Grumman A-6 Intruders instead and to
initiate the VFAX program which resulted in the McDonnell Douglas
F/A-18 Hornet. The F-14C was abandoned before any examples could
be built. </font></p>

<h2><a name="F-14A(Plus), F-14B, F110 engines"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>F-14A(Plus), F-14B, F110 engines</b></font></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b> </b></font></h2>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Following the cancellation
of the F-14B, F-14A BuNo 157986 was put into storage. In 1981, it
was taken out of storage and re-engined with two General Electric
F101 DFE (Derivative Fighter Engine) turbofans, each rated at
16,400 lb.s.t. dry and 27,400 lb.s.t. with afterburning. The
F101-DFE used the core engine from the F101, which had originally
been developed for the B-1B, and was modified by adding a
scaled-up fan and augmenter nozzle taken from the F404 engine
used by the F/A-18A Hornet. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The first flight of the <i>Super
Tomcat </i>(as the aircraft was unofficially known) took place on
July 14, 1981 at Calverton. Grumman test pilot Chuck Sewell
called this aircraft &quot;a fighter pilot's dream&quot;. The
test program showed significant performance gains, including a 62
percent increase in intercept radius, and such vast improvements
in takeoff performance that non-afterburning carrier takeoffs
were now a distinct possibility. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In the meantime, the Air
Force had decided to adopt an alternative engine strategy for
both the F-15 and F-16 fighters, splitting engine orders between
Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric. With each new fiscal
year, a new set of engine orders would be issued. Having a second
source would help to ensure a steady supply of engines, and
competition between these two companies would, it was hoped, keep
prices down. The Navy announced that it too would move to
competitive yearly engine evaluations in selecting a new
powerplant for the Tomcat. Initially, the Navy announced that the
candidates would be the General Electric F110 and the Pratt &amp;
Whitney PW1128 turbofans. However, in the summer of 1983, the
Navy abandoned this plan and announced that they would rely on
the results of the USAF's competitive evaluation. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The two USAF candidates
were the General Electric F101 DFE (now redesignated F110) and a
revised Pratt &amp; Whitney F100. In February 1984, the USAF
announced that General Electric had been awarded with 75 percent
of the total contract for engines for the FY1985 run of F-16
fighters. All of the FY 85 F-15 Eagles and the remaining FY 85
F-16s would use the upgraded Pratt &amp; Whitney F100. The F110
was to be phased into the General Dynamics F-16 production line
as soon as production engines became available, but it was agreed
that individual USAF F-16 units would never operate a mix of
engine types, the choice of engine being made at the wing level.
Future models of the F-15 would be designed to accept either the
F110 and F100. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Navy liked the F110
better than the F100 since the F110 had greater thrust and
promised to have lower overall support costs. The Navy announced
that they would be adopting the F110 for all future Tomcats, and
would not be doing USAF-style annual procurement competitions. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In August 1984, the Navy
awarded Grumman a contract for improved versions of the F-14 and
A-6. The new Tomcat would be known as the F-14D. The troublesome
TF30 would be replaced by the F110-GE-400, the avionics would
upgraged from analog to digital, the aircraft would receive an
enhanced radar, a new computer, a stores management system, new
controls, new displays, and a digital INS. While the full F-14D
avionics suite was being developed, an interim aircraft,
designated F-14A(Plus), would be produced which would introduce
only the F110 engines and keep the F-14A electronics suite.
However, all F-14A(Plus) aircraft would eventually be upgraded to
full F-14D status. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The go-ahead for the
interim F-14A(Plus) and the definitive F-14D program was given in
July of 1984, when Grumman was awarded a contract. Both these
versions were to be powered by General Electric F110-GE-400
turbofans, rated at an afterburning thrust of 27,000 lb.s.t.
each. The engines were to be fitted with a computerized fuel
control system to prevent compressor stalls in all flight
regimes. In addition, the F-14A(Plus) was to be fitted with the
AN/ALR-67 threat warning and recognition system. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The basic F110 was
considerably shorter than the TF30 which it replaced. In order to
avoid having to completely redesign the air intake ducting, the
Navy version of this engine was &quot;stretched&quot; in length
by adding a new section between the engine and the afterburning
section. Apparently, this created no significant engineering
difficulties. The nozzle is positioned 11 inches further aft,
which should reduce the aerodynamic drag of the boat-tail area of
the rear fuselage. Very few structural changes were needed to
adapt the F-14A to the new F110 engine. Almost the only changes
needed were the rearrangement of the engine accessories and their
drive gearbox, plus minor modifications of the surrounding F-14
secondary structure. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">F-14A BuNo 157986 (which
had also served as the F-14B prototype) was chosen as the engine
development aircraft for the new aircraft and was fitted with a
pair of F110-GE-400s in 1986 and took off on its first flight on
September 29, 1986, piloted by Joe Burke. This engine offered
considerable extra thrust over the old TF30 turbofan, and offered
a considerable better performance. The new F110 engines offered
the additional benefit of fewer compressor stalls, a more
unrestricted throttle movement throughout the entire flight
regime, and improved fuel economy. In addition, the F110-GE-400
had over 80 percent commonality with F110 variants used by the
Air Force. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The increased power of the
F110 engine dramatically improved all-round combat performance.
It also made it possible to make catapult takeoffs from carriers
without afterburner. The fuel consumption of the F110 was also
much better than that of the TF30, increasing the mission radius
by 62 percent. Time to reach high altitudes was reduced by 61
percent. Last and by no means least, the pilot could at long last
forget about his engine during combat maneuvers and move the
throttles shut or wide open no mater what the angle of attack or
airspeed without having to worry about the danger of a compressor
stall. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The F-14A(Plus) program
called for the manufacture of 38 new aircraft and the rebuilding
of 32 existing F-14As. BuNo 158630, the first F-14A(Plus) rebuilt
from a TF30-powered F-14A, flew on December 11, 1986, and the
first new-build F-14A(Plus) (BuNo 162910) flew on November 14,
1987. A second new-build F-14A(Plus) was accepted in 1987, 17
were delivered in 1989. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Externally, the F-14A(Plus)
can be distinguished from the F-14A by its larger engine exhaust
nozzles, the deletion of the wing glove vanes, a modified door
near the gun port, and the installation of the new AN/ALR-67
radar warning receiver with antennae below the wing glove area. A
new Direct Lift Control/Approach Power Control system was
installed, and the gun bay was redesigned, incorporating a gas
purging system with NACA-type inlets replacing the original
grilles. A fatigue/engine-monitoring system was added and
AN/ARC-182 UHF/VHF radios are installed. The modernized and
modified radar fire control system was redesignated AN/AWG-15F. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In May of 1991, the Navy
decided to redesignate the F-14A(Plus) F-14B, using the same
designation as that of the stillborn F401-powered aircraft of
1973. A total of 38 F-14Bs were newly built. 32 additional F-14Bs
were produced by conversion from existing F-14A airframes. These
conversions were allocated the sequential KB-series
identifications KB-1 to KB-32 respectively. About 17 more
conversions have since been funded. Most F-14Bs may be upgraded
to F-14D standards under a general depot-level update program
that was used for some of the earlier F-14As. </font></p>

<h2><a name="F-14D"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>F-14D </b></font></a></h2>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The F-14D designation had
originally been assigned to a cost-reduced, stripped version of
the Tomcat, proposed at a time when the rapidly-increasing cost
of the F-14A was causing great concern. This project never
achieved fruition. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The F-14D that is known
today originated back in 1984 as an advanced Tomcat derivative
that was to be developed in parallel with the F-14A(Plus). Both
variants were to be powered by the 27,600 lb.s.t. Pratt &amp;
Whitney F110-PW-400 turbofan, designed to remedy some of the
defects of the TF30, particularly the problems with compressor
stall, but the F-14D was to possess a much more advanced avionics
suite. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The avionics suite of the
F-14D was to be centered around the Hughes AN/APG-71 radar. The
APG-71 radar is a digital processing system that replaces the
AWG-9 of the F-14A and gives the F-14D improved detection and
tracking range. The APG-71 is a development of the APG-70 used in
the F-15E Strike Eagle. It features a low-sidelobe antenna, a
sidelobe-blanking guard channel, and monopulse angle tracking,
all of which are intended to make the radar less vulnerable to
jamming. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The F-14D is equipped with
dual AYK-14 Standard Airborne Computers. The F-14D is a
&quot;digital ship&quot;, based on a multiprocessor MIL-STD-1553B
database system to which all the avionics are connected. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">On the F-14A, integration
of the missiles was handled by the AWG-9, but on the F-14D this
is done by a digital stores management system. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The F-14D is provided with
a dual chin pod under the nose that contains both a Television
Camera System (TCS) and an Infrared Search and Track (IRST)
system. Previous Tomcat versions carried one or the other of
these systems, but not both. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The wing glove box leading
edge extensions of the F-14D were recontoured to house antennae
for the ALR-45, for the Itek ALR-67 radar-warning receiver and
for an AN/ALQ-165 airborne self protection jammer. The ALR-67
incorporates both the traditional crystal-video pattern type of
receiver used for radar warning, plus a superheterodyne receiver
receiver controlled by a high-speed reprogrammable digital
processor. This makes it more flexible in the face of evolving
threats. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The F-14D uses the ASN-130
digital inertial navigational system, which is also used by the
F/A-18A. The new ASN-139 laser inertial navigation system is
designed to be compatible with the -130. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In addition, the F-14D has
equipment for onboard oxygen generation and features revised
cockpit displays with night vision goggle capability. It is
equipped with the new Martin Baker Mk 14 Navy Aircrew Common
Ejection Seats (NACES), which offer the possibility of
higher-velocity escapes (up to 700 knots in level flight and 600
knots at any attitude). </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In contrast to the F-14A,
all of the F-14Ds are capable of carrying the TARPS
reconnaissance pod. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The F-14D can make an
operational sortie 150 miles from the carrier, loiter for two
hours, and retain sufficient fuel reserves for several passes on
its return to the carrier. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In support of the F-14D
development program, four TF30-powered F-14As were converted,
serials being 161865, 161867, 162595, and 161623. F-14A BuNo
161865 was modified as an avionics test bed for the F-14D program
and flew for the first time on November 23, 1987. It had F-14D's
APG-71 radar, digitized avionics and cockpit, but retained the
TF30 engines. In 1988, 161867 was fitted with a pair of
F110-GE-400s to become the first fully-configured F-14D. This
aircraft flew for the first time on April 21, 1988, piloted by
Tom Cavanaugh. It was later brought up to partial F-14D
configuration with the D-model's avionics and radar. 162595 and
161623 were both powered by TF30 turbofans and made their maiden
flights on May 31 and September 21, 1988, respectively, and were
used for radar and stores management integration, ECM and RWR
testing, and IRST and TCS integration, plus live weapons firing
and JTIDS development and systems verification. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The first production F-14D
was first flown on February 9, 1990 and was displayed in a March
23, 1990 ceremony at Calverton. Externally, the most obvious
difference between the F-14D and the F-14A is the presence of the
dual chin pod under the nose of the F-14D that contains both the
Television Camera System (TCS) and the Infrared Search and Track
(IRST). </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Grumman had hoped to
deliver at least 12 &quot;new-build&quot; F-14Ds to the Navy
every year through 1998, while also remanufacturing many of the
earlier F-14As to F-14D standards. However, in 1989 Secretary of
Defense Dick Cheney decided that the entire F-14D program should
be terminated in an economy move. Newspaper and TV advertisements
did nothing to persuade Cheney to change his mind. However, the
Navy still wanted more F-14Ds, and Secretary of the Navy H.
Lawrence Garrett issued a strong appeal for at least 132
&quot;new-build&quot; F-14Ds from 1992 onward. Secretary Cheney
turned this proposal down flat, and went a step further in March
1991, and deleted all F-14D production funds from the FY 1992
budget. This was a catastrophe for Grumman, stopping Tomcat
production in its tracks and forcing massive layoffs. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Thirty-seven of the planned
127 new-build F-14Ds were completed before the program was
cancelled. The last F-14D was delivered to the Navy on July 20,
1992. Another 18 F-14Ds were produced by conversions of existing
F-14As, these planes being redesignated F-14D(R) upon completion
of the conversions. A total of 104 F-14D(R) conversions were
originally planned, but the program was cut way back in the 1989
budget reduction. The six F-14D(R) aircraft of FY90 were spared
the axe, but 98 planned conversions funded between FY91 and FY95
were cancelled. However, the 12 FY91 F-14D(R) conversions were
later restored. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">A total of 55 F-14D
new-builds and conversions were produced. This was enough to
equip only three front-line squadrons. These F-14D-equipped
squadrons are VF-2 <i>Bounty Hunters</i>, VF-11 <i>Red Rippers</i>,
and VF-31 <i>Tomcatters</i>. In addition, part of the Pacific
Fleet training unit VF-124 is equipped with F-14Ds. A few
prototype and early test F-14Ds have been redesignated NF-14Ds
and serve with some dedicated test units. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Along with the F-14Bs in
service, the F-14Ds are to receive a planned Block 1 upgrade.
This includes the introduction of GPS capability, a digital
flight control system, AN/ARC-210 radios, and probably an attack
FLIR, plus the capability of carrying the AN/ALE-50 towed decoy. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Early F-14Ds 163145 and
163146 were permanently assigned to test duties under the
designation NF-14D. They were operated by VX-4. The N prefix
indicates that the planes have received a degree of modification
which makes it impractical to return them to operational status. </font></p>

<h2><a name="F-14 for the Air Force, never built"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>F-14 for the Air Force, never
built </b></font></a></h2>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In 1971, Grumman proposed
the F-14 as a contender for the USAF's Improved Manned
Interceptor program, which was an attempt to find a replacement
for the Convair F-106 Delta Dart. The USAF F-14 looked very much
like the Navy F-14 but had enormous conformal fuel tank on the
belly and four external fuel tanks. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The USAF found this
proposal attractive because of its very long range and the
capabilities of its AN/AWG-9 fire control system and its
associated AIM-54 Phoenix missiles. However, the IMI F-14
proposal was ultimately defeated by its high cost, and nothing
ever got off the drawing board. </font></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="F/A-14D"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>F/A-14D
</b></font></a></h2>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">One of the the latest
Tomcat upgrade proposals is the F/A-14D, which is an upgraded
strike derivative of the F-14D. It is proposed as a possible
replacement for the A-6 Intruder, but should not interfere with
the planned F/A-18E/F procurement. If approved, the F/A-14D would
be produced by upgrading existing F-14D, F-14B, and F-14A
airframes. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In the first stage of the
F/A-14D upgrade plan, all of the planes involved would be brought
up to basic F-14D standard, with F110 engines, AYK-14 on-board
computers, and digital avionics. An attack FLIR (Forward-Looking
Infra-Red) would be fitted, and a MIL STD 1760 bus would be added
for compatibility with other advanced weapons systems. In the
second stage of the program, an AN/ALE-50 towed decoy would be
added, a navigation FLIR would be provided and a full night
vision cockpit would be fitted. In the third and last stage,
software modes from the F-15E's AN/APG-71 would be added, which
include Doppler beam sharpening, synthetic aperture, sea surface
search, moving target indication, and a terrain-following mode. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">However, in the current
military drawdown, the F/A-14D proposal has an uncertain future. </font></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="F-14T and F-14X"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>F-14T
and F-14X </b></font></a></h2>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The F-14T was a very
austere Tomcat derivative designed during the early 1970s as a
alternative to the F-14A and B, which were becoming increasingly
costly. The F-14T would have had only Sparrow and Sidewinder
missile capability. The Navy concluded that the F-14T would offer
little advantage over the F-4 Phantom, and the F-14T proceeded no
further than the concept stage. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The F-14X was the
designation given to several different proposals for cost-reduced
Tomcats that were somewhat less radically-downgraded than the
F-14T. Some retained AIM-54 capability, but some eliminated it.
Some of these proposals reduced simultaneous target tracking from
24 to 12 targets, and removed the glove vanes and the approach
power compensator. The various F-14X proposals were discarded
after the Yom Kippur War of October 1973, when high Israeli
attrition rates suggested to the Navy that they had better equip
their carriers with the best-available aircraft. </font></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="F-14 Quickstrike"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>F-14
Quickstrike </b></font></a></h2>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The so-called
&quot;Quickstrike&quot; was a proposed long-range strike fighter
version of the F-14D Tomcat, designed to fill in the gap created
by the cancellation of the A-12 as a possible A-6 Intruder
replacement. It was envisaged as a sort of naval equivalent of
the Air Force's McDonnell Douglas F-15E <i>Strike Eagle</i>. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Quickstrike was
basically a minimum-change F-14D Tomcat equipped with FLIR
capability and provided with more modes for its APG-71 radar.
These additional modes included synthetic aperture and Doppler
Beam Sharpening for ground mapping, making the radar more similar
to the APG-70 of the F-15E. There would be four hardpoints under
the central fuselage which would each carry five munitions
substations, whereas the two wing glove pylons would have two
munitions substations each. Navigation and targeting pods would
be provided that would be similar to those already carried by the
F-15E. The cockpit would have FLIR, HUD, and moving-map displays
for the crew. The aircraft would be capable of carrying and
delivering laser-guided bombs, stand-off SLAM missiles, and
Maverick air-to-surface missiles. HARM antiradiation missiles and
Harpoon antiship missiles could also be carried. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">However, the McDonnell
Douglas F/A-18E/F has been selected as the successor to the A-6,
so the <i>Quickstrike</i> derivative of the Tomcat has a dim
future. </font></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="Super Tomcat 21"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Super
Tomcat 21 </b></font></a></h2>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Super Tomcat 21 is a
proposed multi-role adaptation of the F-14D Tomcat. It was
proposed as a low-cost alternative to the Naval ATF, and drew
heavily on the work done on Grumman's &quot;Quickstrike&quot;
proposal. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Like the
&quot;Quickstrike&quot;, the Super Tomcat 21 was to have a FLIR,
and was to be provided with more modes for its APG-71 radar, such
as synthetic aperature and Doppler Beam Sharpening for mapping.
Four underfuselage hardpoints would have five munitions
substations each, while the two wing glove pylons would have two
substations. Naviagation and targeting pods could be installed.
The Super Tomcat 21 differed, however, from the Quickstrike in
making an attempt to reduce its radar cross section by a
significant amount. In addition, it was to have been powered by
improved F110-GE-129 turbofan engines which offered
&quot;supercruise&quot; (the ability to achieve sustained
supersonic cruising speeds without the need for afterburning) and
would even have included thrust vectoring capability. The Super
Tomcat 21 would also have featured enlarged tailplanes with
extended trailing edges giving greater area, plus
newly-configured wing gloves housing additional internal fuel. It
would also have featured increased-lift slotted flaps and
extended-chord leading edeg wing slats to allow no-wind carrier
takeoffs or conventional carrier takeoffs at higher loaded
weights. A new more powerful radar suite would be fitted, and the
weapons delivery capability would be markedly enhanced by the
adoption of helmet-mounted sights. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Attack Super Tomcat 21
was based on the Super Tomcat 21 but had thicker outer wing
panels that carried more fuel. In addition, the aircraft would
have provision for carrying larger external fuel tanks.
Refinements to the leading-edge slats and the trailing-edge flaps
were to give a 18-mph reduction in the landing approach speed.
The aircraft was to have had the Norden radar that had been
developed for the abortive General Dynamics/McDonnell Douglas
A-12 Avenger II. The Attack Super Tomcat 21 has received quite a
bit of attention as a potential alternative to the cancelled
A-12. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">However, in the present
military drawdown mode, both of these Tomcat 21 proposals share
an uncertain future. </font></p>
