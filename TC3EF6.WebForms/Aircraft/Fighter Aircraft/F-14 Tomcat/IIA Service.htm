<h2><a name="Tomcat in Iranian service"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Tomcat in Iranian service</b></font></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b> </b></font></h2>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The F-14A Tomcat was
exported to only one foreign customer, the Nirou Havai
Shahanshahiye Iran, or Imperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF). </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The government of the Shah
of Iran had been granted large amounts of military assistance by
the United States government in the hope that Iran would act as a
bulwark against Soviet expansions southward into the region of
the Persian Gulf. In addition, Iranian oil revenues made it
possible for the Shah's government to purchase massive amounts of
Western-manufactured arms, including advanced warplanes such as
the Northrop F-5A and E, the McDonnell F-4D and E Phantom, and
the Lockheed P-3F Orion. In addition, large numbers of Chieftain
and Shir main battle tanks were purchased from Britain. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In May of 1972, President
Richard Nixon had visited Iran and the Shah had mentioned to him
that MiG-25 Foxbat aircraft of the Soviet Air Force had regularly
been flying unimpeded over Iranian territory. The Shah asked
Nixon for equipment which could intercept these high-speed
intruders, and Nixon told the Shah that he could order either the
F-14 Tomcat or the F-15 Eagle. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In August of 1973, the Shah
selected the F-14 Tomcat, and the sale was approved by the US
government in November of 1972. The initial order signed in
January of 1974 covered 30 Tomcats, but in June 50 more were
added to the contract. At the same time, the Iranian
government-owned Melli Bank agreed to loan Grumman $75 million to
partially make up for a US government loan of $200 to Grumman
which had just been cancelled. This loan enabled Grumman to
secure a further loan of $125 from a consortium of American
banks, ensuring at least for the moment that the F-14 program
would continue. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Iranian Tomcat was
virtually identical to the US Navy version, with only a few
classified avionics items being omitted. The base site for
Iranian Tomcat operations was at Isfahan. Imperial Iranian Air
Force aircrews began to arrive in the USA for training in May of
1974, and shortly thereafter the first Grumman pilots arrived in
Iran. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Iranian Tomcats were
fairly late on the production line, and were therefore delivered
with the TF30-P-414 engine, which was much safer than the
compressor-stall-prone P-412 engine. The first of 80 Tomcats
arrived in Iran in January of 1976. By May of 1977, when Iran
celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Royal House, 12 had been
delivered. At this time, the Soviet Foxbats were still making a
nuisance of themselves by flying over Iran, and the Shaw ordered
live firing tests of the Phoenix to be carried out as a warning.
In August of 1977, IIAF crews shot down a BQM-34E drone flying at
50,000 feet, and the Soviets took the hint and Foxbat overflights
promptly ended. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The IIAF Tomcats bore the
US Navy serial numbers of 160299/160378, and were assigned the
IIAF serial numbers 3-863 to 3-892 and 3-6001 to 3-6050. The last
of 79 Tomcats were delivered to Iran in 1978. One Iranian Tomcat
(BuNo 170378) was retained in the USA for use as a testbed. Iran
also ordered 714 Phoenix missiles, but only 284 had been
delivered at the time of the Revolution. These Phoenix missiles
were of slightly-reduced capability as compared with those
delivered to the US Navy. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Toward the end of the
1970s, there was increasing chaos in Iran. On January 16, 1979,
the Shah fled the country and on April 1, an Islamic republic was
declared, with the Ayatolla Khomeini as the head of state. The
Imperial Iranian Air Force was renamed the Islamic Republic of
Iran Air Force (IRIAF). The new government rapidly took on an
anti-Western stance, denouncing the United States as the
&quot;great Satan&quot;. Following the Islamic revolution,
massive numbers of contracts with Western arms suppliers were
cancelled by the new government, including an order for 400
AIM-54A Phoenix missiles. Relations with the USA became
increasingly strained, especially by the occupation of the US
embassy in Teheran by militant students and the holding of 52
Americans hostage. The US responded with a cutoff of all
political and military ties to Iran and the imposition of a
strict arms embargo. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">This arms embargo against
Iran imposed by the West caused a severe spare parts and
maintenance problem. Even the best-equipped units were often
poorly trained and could not operate without Western contractor
support. The political upheavals and purges caused by the
fundamentalist revolution made the situation much worse, with
many pilots and maintenance personnel following the Shah into
exile. As a result, by 1980 the IRIAF was only a shadow of its
former self. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">This embargo was to have a
especially severe long-term effect on the Tomcat fleet, since the
embargo prevented the delivery of any spares. In addition, by
August of 1979, all 79 of the F-14A Tomcats had supposedly been
sabotaged so that they could no longer fire their Phoenix
missiles. According to various accounts, this was done either by
departing Grumman technicians, by Iranian Air Force personnel
friendly to the US shortly after the fall of the Shah, or even by
Iranian revolutionaries in an attempt to prevent operations by an
Air Force perceived to be too pro-Western. The Iran-Iraq war
began on September 22, 1980 with an Iraqi air attack on six
Iranian air bases and four Iranian army bases. It was followed by
an Iraqi land attack at four points along a 700-kilometer front.
Before the war ended in 1988, somewhere between 500,000 and a
million people were dead, between 1 and 2 million people were
injured, and there were two to three million refugees. Although
little-covered in the Western media, the war was a human tragedy
on a massive scale. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Air power did not play a
dominant role in the Iran-Iraq war, because both sides were
unable to use their air forces very effectively.
Fighter-vs-fighter combat was rather rare throughout the entire
course of the Iran-Iraq war. During the first phase of the war,
Iranian aircraft had the fuel and the endurance to win most of
these aerial encounters, either by killing with their first shot
of an AIM-9 or else by forcing Iraqi fighters to withdraw.
However, at this stage in the war the infrared homing missiles
used by the fighters of both sides were generally ineffective in
anything other than tail-chase firings at medium to high
altitudes. Initially, Iranian pilots had the edge in training and
experience, but as the war dragged on, this edge was gradually
lost because of the repeated purges within the ranks of the
Iranian military which removed experienced officers and pilots
who were suspected of disloyalty to the Islamic fundamentalist
regime or those with close ties or sympathies with the West. As
Iranian capabilities declined, Iraqi capabilities gradually
improved. After 1982, Iraq managed to improve its training and
was able to acquire newer and better arms from French
manufacturers, especially the Dassault Breguet Super Etendard and
the Mirage F-1. The Mirage F-1 was capable of firing the Matra
R-550 Magic air-to-air missile, which had a 140-degree attack
hemisphere, a head-on attack capability, high-g launch and
maneuver capability, and a 0.23 to 10-km range. The Magic could
also be launched from the MiG-21, and proved to be far superior
than the standard Soviet-supplied infrared homer, the Atoll.
Mirage F-1s were reported to have shot down several Iranian
aircraft with Magic missiles and as having scored kills even at
low altitudes. After 1982, Iraq generally had the edge in most
air-to-air encounters that took place, with Iran losing most of
the few air-to-air encounters that took place after 1983 unless
it used carefully-planned ambushes against Iraqi planes that were
flying predictable routes. The Iranians could not generate more
than 30-60 sorties per day, whereas the number of sorties that
Iraq could mount steadily increased year after year, reaching a
peak as high as 600 in 1986-88. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Tomcat never proved
very effective in IRIAF service, since only a relatively small
number could be kept airworthy at any one time. Very often, they
served in a mini-AWACS role by virtue of their powerful radars
and were deliberately not risked in combat. Several Iranian
Tomcats were reported lost in action, most of the reported losses
being kill claims by Iraqi sources. Iraq first claimed to have
shot down an Iranian F-14Aa on November 21, 1982, the kill
reportedly being made by a Mirage F1EQ. In March 1982, a downed
Iranian pilot is reported to have told his captors that he was
really surprised to see an Iraqi MiG-21 shoot down such an
advanced aircraft as an F-14. On September 11, 1983, two Iranian
Tomcats attempting to intercept Iraqi aircraft attacking Iranian
positions were claimed to have been shot down. One Tomcat was
lost in a dogfight with Iraqi aircraft on October 4, 1883,
another in an air battle over Bahragan on November 21, 1983 and
single examples were lost on February 24, and July 1, 1984. Iraq
claims to have shot down three F-14As in a single day on August
11, 1984. It is impossible to judge the reliability of these
claims, but there is probably nothing intrinsically implausible
about them. Iranian F-14As are known to have shot down at least
three Iraqi fighters, including two Mirage F1s and one MiG-21. An
Iranian Tomcat achieved a kill against an Iraqi Mirage F1 as late
as the spring of 1988, indicating that the IRIAF was able to keep
at least one Tomcat operational. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">It is extremely difficult
to get any reliable estimates of just how many Iranian F-14As
were in service at any one time during the war. Western
intelligence estimates tended to put the number of serviceable
Tomcats flying with the IRIAF at a very low level, often less
than ten, with planes having been deliberately cannibalized to
keep at least a few flying. In the summer of 1984, the Pentagon
estimated that Iran could field only 15-20 Tomcats, maintaining
them largely by cannibalization. Iranian sources tended to
discount these Western estimates as &quot;imperialist
propaganda&quot;, and placed the number of in-service Tomcats at
a much higher value. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">An indication that Western
intelligence may have consistently underestimated Iranian
capabilities in this area may have taken place on February 11,
1985, when no less than 25 Iranian F-14A Tomcats took place in a
mass flypast over Teheran. In spite of the Western arms embargo,
Iran seems to have been able to maintain a more-or-less steady
supply of spare parts for its fleet of Tomcats, Phantoms, and
F-5Es. Some of these parts seem to have been smuggled into Iran
by collusion with Israel. Some may have come in as a result of
the &quot;arms-for-hostages&quot; deal in which the US government
supplied arms to Iran in exchange for its assistance in getting
hostages held in Lebanon released. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Phoenix missiles and/or
their guidance avionics were reportedly rendered inoperative by
sabotage before the war began and have not been operational
since. There are no reports of any Phoenix missiles being fired
during the Iran-Iraq war. However, the AN/AWG-9 radar did remain
operational, and the Iranian Tomcats could still fire AIM-7 and
AIM-9 missiles. Most IRIAF Tomcats flew with a missile load of
four Sparows and two Sidewinders. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The accidental shootdown of
Iran Air Flight 655 by missiles launched from the USS <em>Vincennes</em>
on July 3, 1988 with the loss of 290 lives may have been caused
by the accidental misidentification of the Airbus A300 as an
IRIAF F-14A by the ship's radar system operators. Rumors had been
going about that Iranian F-14As had been fitted with the
capability to launch air-to-surface anti-ship missiles. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Despite the Iranian
regime's official anti-Communist stance (the Communist Party is
officially banned in Iran), there are persistent rumors that one
or perhaps several IRIAF F-14A were delivered to the Soviet Union
in exchange for other arms assistance. At least one Iranian F-14A
crew has reportedly defected to the Soviet Union. There is every
reason to believe that the F-14A, its AWG-9 fire control system,
and its Phoenix missiles were completely compromised at this
time. An examination of the Phoenix supposedly helped the Soviets
to build the Vympel R-33 (known in the West as AA-9 <em>Amos</em>)
long-range missiles which arm the MiG-31 Foxhound. However,
Gennadiy Sokolovskiy of the Vympel Design Bureau denies that the
R-33 was based on the AIM-54 Phoenix, maintaining that he has
never actually seen a live Phoenix. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">I believe that some F-14As
are still flying in Iran, but I am not sure of the number. </font></p>
