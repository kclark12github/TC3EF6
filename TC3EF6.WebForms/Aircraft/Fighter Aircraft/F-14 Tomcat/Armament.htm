History</b></font></h1>

<h2><a name="Armament suite of the F-14A Tomcat"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>Armament suite of the F-14A
Tomcat </b></font></a></h2>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Even today, the armament of
the F-14A Tomcat remains the most potent of that of any
interceptor currently in service. It has four basic
components--an internal cannon and Sidewinder infrared homing
missiles for short-range encounters, Sparrow semi-active radar
homing missiles for intermediate-range encounters, and Phoenix
missiles for long-range encounters. All of these weapons are
directed and controlled by the powerful AN-AWG-9 fire control
system. </font></p>

<p><a name="Fire-Control System:"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><strong><u>Fire-Control System:</u></strong></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The heart of the Tomcat's
weapons system is the powerful Hughes AN/AWG-9 fire control
system. The AWG-9 has the ability to carry out near-simultaneous
long-range missile launches against up to six targets while
tracking 24 more. The set incorporates a lightweight 5400B
digital computer. The antenna is a 36-inch flat plate unit. The
IFF antennae are mounted directly on the plate and take the form
of an array of dipoles. The output power is 10.2 kilowatts. The
AWG-9 can look down into ground or sea clutter, detecting and
tracking small targets flying at low level. The clutter is
removed by a signal processor which uses analog filtering. </font></p>

<p><a name="Phoenix:"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><strong><u>Phoenix:</u></strong></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Hughes AIM-54A Phoenix
missile is the primary armament of the F-14A, and the Tomcat was
originally designed with this missile in mind. The Phoenix
missile is propelled by a single-stage Rocketdyne MK47 solid-fuel
rocket motor, which gives a velocity at burnout of Mach 3.8 at
low altitudes, although Mach 5 can be achieved at high altitudes
in the long-range mode. The missile has four fixed delta-shaped
wings and is steered by tail-mounted control surfaces. On trials,
the missile has been able to maneuver at 17 g. The fuselage and
aerodynamic surfaces of the Phoenix are made from metal, but the
fuselage is covered with ablative thermal insulation. The missile
is 13.2 feet long, the body is 13 inches wide, and the wing span
is 3 feet. The launch weight is about 985 pounds The missile has
a 132-pound high-explosive warhead. So far as I am aware, the
Phoenix is not nuclear-capable. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">After launch, the Phoenix
can use three different types of guidance - autopilot,
semi-active radar homing, and fully-active radar homing. For
long-range shots, the missile generally flies a pre-programmed
route immediately after launch under autopilot control. At
midcourse, the nose-mounted radar seeker takes over, operating in
semi-active mode, homing in on radar waves reflected off the
target from the Tomcat's AWG-9 radar. Once it gets within about
14 miles of the target, the Phoenix's own radar takes over for
the final run in to the target, and the missile operates in
fully-active radar homing mode. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">At this time the missile is
completely independent of its launching aircraft, and becomes
&quot;fire-and-forget&quot;. Some reports have suggested the
existence of a &quot;flyout&quot; mode in which the missile can
be launched at heavily-jammed targets upon which the AWG-9 radar
is unable to achieve a lock. In such a mode, the missile flies
most of the way to the target under autopilot control, switching
over to its built-in seeker for the final approach. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">One of the more advanced
features of the AWG-9/Phoenix weapons system is the ability to
track and engage multiple targets at the same time.
Track-While-Scan (TWS) mode is used for multiple-target tracking
and multi-shot Phoenix engagements. As each target within the
region of sky being scanned is detected, the AWG-9 determines its
range and angular position and this information is passed along
to the computer where it is compared to the predicted positions
of the targets already detected. If the newly-detected target can
be correlated with an already-known target, the target's track
file is updated with the current position. If not, then a new
track file is opened for what is presumed to be a new target. The
computer then assigns threat priorities to each track. In this
mode, each target is not continually illuminated by the radar,
and the Phoenix missile guidance system receives only samples of
radar data. Maximum missile range in this mode is about 90 km. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In Range-While-Search (RWS)
mode, the set provides range and angular data without stopping
the normal antenna TWS search pattern. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Pulse-Doppler
Single-Target Track (PDSTT) mode is used when a single target is
to be tracked. The AWG-9 antenna is locked on to a single
long-range target at ranges of up to 130 km. The missile can be
launched at 100 km range. A Jam Angle Track (JAT) facility can be
use to provide range, speed, and angular information on targets
being protected by ECM. In this mode, the radar can be slaved to
the aircraft's electro-optical sighting unit. The AWG-9 also has
conventional pulse modes for use at short and medium ranges. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">On maximum-range missions,
the Phoenix is usually lofted into a high trajectory designed to
reduce interference between the AWG-9's powerful transmitter and
the missile's receiving system. The flight time on such missions
can be up to three minutes. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Tomcat has the
capability of carrying up to six Phoenix missiles, four on
individual pallets mounted underneath the fuselage and one on
each of the fixed wing glove pylons. However, in typical
operations, the usual weapons load is four Phoenix, two Sparrows,
and two Sidewinders. The original specification called for six
Phoenix missiles, but it was found that the deck impacts during
carrier landings were too hard when carrying six Phoenix
missiles, so the full load of six Phoenixes is rarely carried. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The first Phoenix launch
from a Tomcat took place on April 28, 1972. During a later test,
a Phoenix missile hit a target which had been flying at a
distance of 116 miles when the missile was launched. In November
22, 1973 a single Tomcat fired six Phoenix missiles in 38 seconds
while flying at Mach 0.78 at 24,800 feet over Point Mugu,
California. The targets were six drones. One Phoenix missile
failed and a second was released against a drone which veered off
course, but the other four scored direct hits. In other tests,
the AWG-9/Phoenix combination has scored hits against Bomarc
missiles simulating the MiG-25 Foxbat and against drones
simulating the Tu-26 Backfire. Others test verified the
capability of the Phoenix against sea-skimming anti-ship cruise
missiles and against violently-maneuvering targets. The AIM-54A
was approved for service use on January 28, 1975. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The AIM-54B had improved
resistance to jamming, and was introduced into service in 1983.
It had sheet-metal wings and fins instead of honeycomb structure,
non-liquid hydraulic and thermal conditioning system, and
somewhat simplied engineering. The AIM-54C had a higher-thrust
motor, an improved warhead, fully solid-state electronics, and an
improved fuse that was better capable of detonating the warhead
at the precise moment to maximize its destructive effect on the
target. The AIM-54C has better electronic counter-countermeasures
capability, allowing it to cope with small, low-altitude targets,
being able to discriminate between the true target and any
&quot;chaff&quot; that might be released in an attempt to break
lock-on. The AIM-54C has the ability to take on targets at
greater range or higher altitudes than can the A version, and can
cope with higher degrees of target maneuverability. The goal was
to make the Phoenix a better counter against the Soviet AS-4 <i>Kitchen</i>
and AS-6 <i>Kingfish </i>stand-off missiles. The move to field an
improved Phoenix missile may have been at least partly spurred by
the fear that the Soviets may have been able to get their hands
on one or more of the earlier AIM-54As that had been supplied to
Iran before the fall of the Shah and the rise of the Islamic
fundamentalist regime that now controls that country. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">It is not very often that
Phoenix missiles are fired during training, since they cost over
a million dollars a shot. The Phoenix missile has never been
fired in actual combat. </font></p>

<p><a name="Sparrow:"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><strong><u>Sparrow:</u></strong></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The AIM-7C, D, and E
versions of the Sparrow semi-active radar homing missile were
used in Vietnam with disappointing results. The Sparrow had
originally been designed to attack subsonic, non-maneuvering,
large targets such as bombers. If fired against maneuvering
targets or against targets flying below 5000 feet, it usually
missed. In the Vietnam War, only 9 percent of the Sparrows
launched in anger actually hit their targets. In all fairness,
however, some of the disappointing results with the Sparrow can
be blamed on the Rules of Engagement that were in force at the
time, which generally forbade the launch of Sparrows during
beyond visible range encounters (where they could have been the
most effective), lest they inadvertently be fired against
friendlies. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The first Sparrow version
to be used by the F-14A was the AIM-7E-2, which had been used in
the latter stages of the Vietnam war. It contained numerous
&quot;fixes&quot; intended to to cure some of the problems of
reliability that had been encountered in Vietnam. Among these
were the use of clipped wings, an improved autopilot, and better
fusing. In the AIM-7F that was first introduced in 1977,
solid-state electronics were substituted for the miniature vacuum
tubes of the earlier versions. This miniaturization enabled the
warhead to be moved forward of the wings, with the aft part of
the missile being devoted almost entirely to the rocket motor.
The extra space that was made available by the introduction of
solid-state miniaturization made it possible to introduce a
dual-thrust booster/sustainer rocket motor that enabled the
effective range of the Sparrow to be essentially doubled (up to
28-30 miles) in a head-on engagement. The AIM-7L had fewer tubes
and more solid state features. The AIM-7M introduced in 1982
featured a inverse-processed digital monopulse seeker which was
more difficult to detect and jam and provided better look-down,
shoot-down capability. The AIM-7P was fitted with improved
guidance electronics including an on-board computer based on
VLSIC technology. It is intended to have better capability
against small targets such as cruise missiles and sea-skimming
antiship missiles. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The AIM-7M is 12 feet long
and has a launch weight of about 500 pounds. The missile carries
a 85-pound high-explosive blast fragmentation warhead. It has two
sets of delta-shaped fins--a set of fixed fins at the rear of the
missile and a set of movable fins at the middle of the missile
for steering. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The AIM-7M is usually
carried in pairs on the bottom rail of the wing glove pylons of
the Tomcat, but up to four additional Sparrows can be carried
semi-recessed in slots underneath the belly. However, this space
is usually reserved for four AIM-54 Phoenix missiles. After
Sparrow missile launch, the F-14 must continue to illuminate the
target with its radar in order for the missile to home in for a
kill. For the F-14, this means staying within a 65-degree cone so
that the antenna of the AWG-9 will be able to follow the target. </font></p>

<p><a name="Sidewinder:"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><strong><u>Sidewinder:</u></strong></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Sidewinder infrared
homing missile dates back to 1956, but the missile has been
continuously upgraded over the years. The Tomcat can carry four
AIM-9 Sidewinders (two on each wing glove pylon), but the usual
load is two, mounted one each on outboard shoulder pylons
attached to the fixed wing glove section. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Early F-14As carried the
AIM-9J, which was the first major post-Vietnam improvement of the
Sidewinder missile. The J model had an expanded target-engagement
cone which enabled it to be launched at any spot in the rear half
of a target aircraft rather than merely at its exhaust. Compared
with the Vietnam-era AIM-9G, it had a more powerful motor and an
improved warhead. The AIM-9J introduced the Sidewinder Expanded
Acquisition Mode (SEAM), which slaved the seeker head of the
missile to the radar when in &quot;dogfight&quot; mode, which
enabled the AIM-9J seeker head to be uncaged, slewed toward a
specific target by the aircraft radar, and made to track that
particular target only. The AIM-9H introduced some minor
improvements. The AIM-9L introduced in 1979 was
&quot;all-aspect&quot;, and was no longer limited to engaging an
enemy aircraft from the rear. The seeker head was more sensitive
and was able to pick up heat from the friction off the leading
edges of an aircraft's wing and was able to distinguish between
aircraft and decoy flares. The AIM-9L also uses a higher-impulse
rocket motor, a more powerful warhead, and a proximity fuse
rigged to blow outward toward the target in order to ensure
better probability of a kill. The AIM-9M introduced in 1982 had
better capability to distinguish between aircraft and decoy
flares, and has a low-smoke rocket motor so that it is less
likely to be seen by its prey. The number of vacuum tubes was
reduced to two. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The AIM-9 Sidewinder is 9.4
feet long, has a wingspan of 25 inches and a diameter of 5
inches. The missile has four tail fins on the rear, with a
&quot;rolleron&quot; at the tip of each fin. These
&quot;rollerons&quot; are spun at high speed by the slipstream in
order to provide roll stability. The missile is steered by four
canard fins mounted in the forward part of the missile just
behind the infrared seeker head. The Sidewinder missile has a
launch weight of about 180 pounds, and a maximum effective range
of about 10 miles. The blast-fragmentation warhead weighs 21
pounds. Despite the advanced age of the basic design, the
all-aspect Sidewinder remains a potent threat, exceeded in
effectiveness perhaps only by the Russian-built Molniya/Vympel
R-73 (known in the West as the AA-11 <i>Archer</i>) which
combines aerodynamic and thrust-vectoring control systems. </font></p>

<p><a name="Cannon"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><strong><u>Cannon</u></strong></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">For really close-in
encounters, the Tomcat is provided with an internally-mounted
cannon. The 20mm General Electric M61A1 Vulcan rotary cannon is
carried on the port side of the forward fuselage. A muzzle gas
diffuser is fitted to prevent gun gases from getting sucked into
the engine intakes where they could cause engine flameouts. A
total of 675 rounds of ammunition are carried in a drum. When the
guns are fired, the empty cases are returned to the drum rather
than being ejected overboard. </font></p>

<p><a name="Bombs:"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><strong><u>Bombs:</u></strong></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The F-14A can carry up to
14,500 pounds of bombs and rockets, although it was not assigned
a ground-attack mission. The under-fuselage pallets which
ordinarily carry Phoenix missiles can also mount bomb racks for
1000-pound Mk 83 or 2000-pound Mk 84 bombs or other free-fall
weaponry. VF-122 dropped the first bombs from a Fleet Tomcat on
August 8, 1990. For a while, an advanced bomb-equipped F-14
Tomcat was pictured as a replacement for the General Dynamics
A-12 Avenger II, cancelled in December 1990. Today, the training
syllabus includes some emphasis on air-to-ground strike, although
such missions would only be carried out in a relatively
permissible combat environment because of the high cost of the
Tomcat. The Tomcat can carry only conventional &quot;dumb&quot;
bombs, and has no precision-guided munition capability except
when operating in conjunction with a separate laser designator
aircraft. </font></p>
