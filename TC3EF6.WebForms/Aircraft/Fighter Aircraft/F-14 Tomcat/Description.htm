Tomcat </b></font></a></h2>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The winning Grumman design
(Design 303E) featured engines in separate nacelles, set well
apart from each other so that damage to one of them would have
minimal effect on the other. The main central and rear area of
the fuselage consisted of two separate engine nacelles joined
together by a shallow flat area known as a &quot;pancake&quot;.
At the extreme rear of the aircraft, this pancake is little more
than a decking between the engine pods. This leaves a deep tunnel
between the engines which imposes a drag penalty. However, it
adds to overall lift, gives an extra attachment area for weapons
pylons, and provides some additional fuselage space for fuel and
equipment. The rear part of the broad between-engines pancake is
gently curved upwards to reduce both the supersonic trim drag and
the negative zero-lift supersonic pitching moment. There are
door-type speed brakes at the rear of the pancake both above and
below, the lower brake being split in two to accommodate the
arrester hook. At the extreme end of the decking are a large fuel
dump pipe and housings for electronic warfare equipment. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">A similar arrangement was
used in the Soviet MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters, which were designed
much later. One of the problems with this configuration is that
it puts the thrust line of each engine rather far outboard from
the centerline, producing sudden and violent nose slices
(rotation in yaw) in the event of an engine failure. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Most of the aircraft
structure was made of conventional aluminum alloys, with some
components being made up of steel. About 25 percent of the empty
weight was made up of titanium alloy, which was used for the wing
box, wing pivots, upper and lower wing skins, the intakes, rear
fuselage skins, as well as the hydraulic lines. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The wings feature variable
sweep, ranging from a minimum of 20 degrees to a maximum of 68
degrees (which could be set manually on the ground to as much as
75 degrees for carrier stowage). The variable-sweep wing panels
are supported by a massive wing carry-through structure which
spans the upper center section of the aircraft, terminating at
each end in a large pivot point for the outer moveable wing
panels. This carry-through structure is made from electron-beam
welded titanium alloy. The fixed wing glove structure forms a
diamond-shaped surface. The beam has slight dihedral to reduce
the cross sectional area of the central fuselage, reducing drag
and assisting in the area-ruling of the fuselage. In order to
maintain a snug fit between the trailing edge of the wing and the
upper surface of the rear fuselage, the rear edges of the fixed
wing glove uses a set of inflatable canvas bags. Teflon paint on
the underside of the wing help to ensure that there is minimal
abrasion of these bags as the wings are extended or retracted. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Wing sweep angle is
automatically controlled by the air-data computer. Throughout the
entire speed/maneuver regime, an automatic wing sweep program
matches the sweep angle to the optimal position. However, the
system can be manually overridden by the pilot in an emergency.
Should the wings get stuck in the fully-aft position, the F-14A
can still land safely at 200 mph with 4000 pounds of fuel or at
166 mph with 2000 pounds of fuel, in spite of the fact that the
wing flaps are inoperative when the wing is swept. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The wing has no
conventional ailerons, roll control being provided at low speeds
by wing-mounted spoilers and at high speeds by the
differentially-moving horizontal tailplane. The full-span
trailing edge flaps have a small inboard section and a larger
outboard section. These flaps are deliberately made inoperative
when the wing is swept back to prevent damage. Leading-edge
maneuvering slats occupy virtually the full span of the outer
wing panel leading edge. To improve combat maneuverability, the
slats and outboard flap sections can be deployed while the wing
is in the fully-forward position. When wing sweep is greater than
57 degrees, the wing spoilers are locked down, and roll control
is provided completely by the differentially-moving horizontal
stabilizers. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Air is admitted to the
engines via two large, rectangular-shaped, sharp-lipped intakes,
one mounted on each side of the fuselage. The edges of the
intakes are swept sharply backward from top to bottom, ensuring
that adequate amounts of air get into the engine at high angles
of attack. These intakes are mounted well outboard of the
fuselage sides, far enough away that turbulent boundary layer air
is kept from entering the engine without the use of complex
diffuser systems such as those fitted to the F-4 Phantom. Because
of the overall dihedral of the wing glove box, the intakes are
canted outwards at the bottom. However, even at the top of the
intakes where they are closest to the fuselage, the inner wall of
the intake is still at least 8 inches away from the fuselage.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The intakes are of
multi-ramp wedge configuration and offer a straight path for the
air entering the engines. Each intake has a pair of adjustable
ramps attached to the upper part of the inner intake. Hydraulic
actuators in the upper part of the intake adjust the positions of
the first and second ramps in the upper surface of the inlet and
of the diffuser ramp located further aft, reducing the inlet air
to subsonic velocity before admitting it to the engine. A gap
between the back edge of the second ramp and the leading edge of
the diffuser ramp allows bleed air to escape from the inlet,
passing overboard via a bleed-air door in the outer surface of
the inlet. The inlet ramps are under the automatic control of a
computer, which calculates the optimal position for the ramps
based on engine speed, air temperature, air pressure, and angle
of attack. At supersonic speeds, the hinged panels narrow down
the throat area while diverting the excess airflow out of the
ducts through aft-facing spill doors at the top of the intakes.
At low speeds (especially during takeoff) when more engine air is
needed, this airflow is reversed and extra air is sucked in.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Two small triangular-shaped
vanes were mounted on the leading edge of the wing gloves. These
vanes are normally retracted, but are extended at supersonic
speeds under the control of the air-data computer. The purpose of
these vanes is to generate additional lift ahead of the
aircraft's center of gravity, which helps to compensate for a
nose-down pitching moment that takes place at supersonic speeds.
These vanes are automatically deployed when the speed exceeds
Mach 1.4 in order to push up the nose and unload the tailplanes,
giving them enough authority to pull 7.5 g at Mach 2. The vanes
can be manually deployed between Mach 1 and Mach 1.4, but will
not operate when the wing sweep is less than 35 degrees because
that would lead to too much pitch instability at low speeds. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The original Design 303E
featured a single tall vertical fin and a folding ventral strake.
At Navy insistence, Grumman switched to a twin-tail configuration
at the last minute and replaced the large folding strake with two
smaller fixed strakes mounted underneath each engine nacelle.
Each of the twin tail fins holds a conventional rudder for yaw
control. The twin tail fins provide an effective means of
countering destabilizing flow generated by the air intakes during
sustained flight at high angles of attack. In addition, the dual
rudders have the added advantage of reduced height for carrier
stowage. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The two-seat, tandem
cockpit is enclosed by a single-piece clamshell-type canopy. The
pilot is in front, and the radar intercept officer is in the
rear. The crew members sit on Martin-Baker GRU-7A
rocket-propelled ejector seats which can be used from zero
altitude/zero airspeed up to 450 knots airspeed. There is minimal
duplication of controls and instruments for the pilot and the
radar intercept officer. The pilot has three displays for viewing
flight, navigation and tactical data, including armament controls
and flight instruments. The aft cockpit has controls and displays
for the AWG-9 fire control system. The back-seater operates the
radar, identifies the adversary, and guides the pilot in making
an effective interception. Unlike in the Phantom, either crew
member can fire a missile. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The engines for the F-14A
are a pair of Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30-P-412 axial flow
turbofans, each rated at 12,350 lb.s.t. dry and 20,900 lb.s.t
with afterburning. The TF30-P-412 was essential similar to the
TF30-P-12 that had been used for the F-111B. The exhaust features
a variable-geometry nozzle with movable petals which slide on
curved tracks to close down to minimum area for subsonic cruise
and fully opened to a convergent and then divergent profile for
afterburning flight during takeoff and at supersonic speeds. The
F-14 employs a system known as Direct Lift Control (DLC) for
automatic control of attitude during carrier landings. When DLC
is engaged, the spoilers on the upper wing pup up into what is
known as the &quot;neutral&quot; position. When these spoilers
are lowered, instant lift is generated with no need for an
attitude change. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">For its primary
interception role, the F-14 is equipped with the Hughes AN/AWG-9
radar fire control system. The AWG-9 has the ability to carry out
near-simultaneous long-range missile launches against up to six
targets while tracking 24 more. The antenna is a 36-inch flat
plate unit. The IFF antennae are mounted directly on the plate
and take the form of an array of dipoles. the output power is
10.2 kilowatts. The AWG-9 can look down into ground or sea
clutter, detecting and tracking small targets flying at low
level. The clutter is removed by a signal processor which uses
analog filtering. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The single-wheeled main
landing gear elements retract forwards into wells inside the wing
glove, rotating 90 degrees to lie flat. The twin-wheeled nose
unit retracts forward into a well in the nose. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Integral fuel tanks are
provided between the wing spars of the outer section, holding 295
US gallons each. The tapering section of the rear fuselage aft of
the wing carry-through structure carries an additional 648 US
gallons of fuel, and a 691-US gallon tank is fitted between the
cockpit and wing carry-through structure. Two feeder tanks
combined offer a 456-gallon capacity, bringing total internal
fuel capacity to 2385 US gallons. A 267-gallon external drop tank
can be carried on hardpoints underneath each air intake. The
Tomcat is equipped for in-flight refuelling via a retractable
probe on the starboard side of the fuselage. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Early Tomcats were equipped
with a gimbal-mounted AN/ALR-23 infrared detection set mounted
underneath the nose that could be slaved to the radar or used
independently to scrutinize areas not searched by the radar. Its
indium antimonide detectors were cooled by a self-contained
Stirling-cycle cryogenic system. In practice, this IR sensor
proved to be ineffective, and was replaced by the Northrop AXX-1
Television Camera Set (TCS), which consists of a television
camera fitted with a stabilized telephoto lens. Displays appear
on both the pilot's and the WSO's control panels. The system can
be used to spot an enemy visually and to identify him early,
hopefully preventing Tomcat pilots from shooting down friendlies.
The first production installation of the TCS was incorporated in
161597, the first Block 125 aircraft. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Central Air Data
Computer (CADC) is an AiResearch CP-1166B/A. It uses data from
sensors which measure pitot and static pressures, air
temperatures, and angle attack to select the optimal wing sweep
angle and sends commands to the control surfaces. It also passes
to the Air Inlet Control Systems (AICS) the information it needs
to set the inlet ramps to their optimal positions. The AN/ARA-63
aircraft approach control system uses the AN/SPN-41 and the
AN/TRN-28 transmitting sets. It provides primary or backup
instrument approach capability. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The spine of the Tomcat
contains blade antennae for the UHF/TACAN and data link/IFF.
Radio and navigation equipment on board the aircraft include the
APX-71 IFF transponder, AXX-76 IFF interrogator, ARC-51 (later
switched to ARC-159) UHF radios, ARR-69 auxiliary receiver, KY-58
cryptographic system, ASN-92 CAINS II (Carrier Aircraft Inertial
Navigation System II) inertial navigation system, APN-154 beacon
augmenter, APN-194 radar altimeter, Gould ARN-84 TACAN and ARA-50
automatic direction finder. A Harris ASW-27B digital datalink
provides high speed data communication between the Tomcat and
ship-based command and control systems. This system can also be
used to link to the Airborne Tactical Data Systems of Grumman
E-2C Hawkeye early warning aircraft. This system can be used to
pass target data back and forth between aircraft, extending the
effective radar range. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Tomcat initially
carried APR-25 and APR-27 radar warning receivers. These have
largely been replaced by the Magnavox ALR-50 which is designed to
warn crews of SAM launches. A major upgrade updated this
equipment to deal with the SA-6 <i>Gainful</i> missile and its
associated <i>Straight Flush</i> radar. The Tomcat is equipped
with the Goodyear ALE-39 chaff and flare dispensing system, which
has replaced the ALE-29 originally carried. The Tomcat entered
service with the Sanders Associateds ALQ-100 noise deception
jammer, but this has been replaced with the Sanders AN/ALQ-126A. </font></p>
