History</b></font></h1>

<hr>

<h2><a name="F-14A in service with US Navy"><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b>F-14A in service with US Navy</b></font></a><font color="#000080" face="Arial"><b> </b></font></h2>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The first F-14A was finally
ready for rollout in late 1970. Taxi trials of the first F-14A
Tomcat (BuNo 157980) began at Calverton on December 14, 1970. On
December 21, project test pilot William (Bob) Millar and company
chief test pilot Robert Smythe made the first flight, which was a
short hop with the wings kept in the fully-forward position. This
flight was uneventful. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Disaster struck on the
second test flight on December 30. During this flight, the
aircraft suffered a primary hydraulic system failure and began to
trail smoke. Millar and Smythe immediately turned the plane back
to the Calverton field, and used the emergency nitrogen bottle to
blow down the landing gear in preparation for an emergency
landing. However, just before reaching the end of the runway, the
secondary hydraulic system also failed and both crewmen were
forced to eject. Both Millar and Smythe survived with only minor
injuries, but the aircraft was destroyed. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The second Tomcat (157981)
went aloft for the first time on May 24, 1971, piloted by Robert
Smythe. Twenty Tomcats were built in the initial run for flight
trials. Tomcat #2 (157981) was assigned the job of the
exploration of the low-speed flight regime and also was to carry
out the stall/spin trials. It had its wings locked in the
20-degree (fully-open) position and the air intakes locked in the
fully-open configuration. Tomcat #3 (157982) was to explore the
outer reaches of the performance envelope and flew trials with
steadily increasing loads and speeds. Tomcats Nos. 4, 5, and 6
(157983, 157984, and 157985) went to NAS Point Mugu, California
for weapons system integration work. No. 7 (157986) later became
the test ship for the F-14B with F401 engines. Nos. 9 and 11
(157988 and 157991) went to Point Mugu for radar evaluation and
auxiliary weapons trials, respectively. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Tomcat #10 (157989) was
delivered to the Naval Air Test Center at Patuxent River,
Maryland for structural trials and carrier compatibility work. On
June 30, 1972, it crashed into the water while preparing for an
airshow at Patuxent, killing test pilot Bob Millar, who had
survived the crash of the first F-14. It was replaced on
carrier-compatibility tests by No. 17. No. 12 replaced the lost
No. 1 on high speed flight trials. Completing the trials fleet
were No. 8 (aerodynamic trials and production configuration), No.
13 (anechoic chamber work for compatibility of the
electromagnetic systems), No. 14 (maintenance and reliability
work), No. 20 (climatic trials at Point Mugu), and Nos. 15, 16,
18, and 19 (initial pilot conversion). </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">157984, Tomcat #5 assigned
to Point Mugu for armament trials, had the rather dubious honor
of shooting itself down on June 20, 1973. A AIM-7E-2 Sparrow
missile pitched up moments after being launched, striking the
Tomcat. The crew ejected safely. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Block 70 (beginning with
159978) introduced the production standard wing glove fairing
with shorter outboard wing fences on the top. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The beaver tail and air
brake were modified from BuNo 159241 onward (the first Block 75
Tomcat). Earlier aircraft had their beaver tails cut down (with
dielectric fairings removed) to a similar shape. The last Block
85 aircraft (159588) introduced the new AN/ARC-159 UHF radio in
place of the AN/ARC-51A. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">From 159825 (the first
Block 90), a small angle of attack probe was added to the tip of
the nose radome. High angle of attack performance was also
improved by the provision for automated maneuvering flaps. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">From Block 100 onward, a
slip clutch and coupler installation was added to the flap/slat
system, fuel system changes were made, AN/AWG-9 reliability
improvements were incorporated, and numerous anti-corrosion
measures such as seals, baffles, and drain holes were introduced.
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The last aircraft of Block
110 (BuNo 161168) introduced AN/ALQ-126 antenna to the beaver
tail and above and below the wing gloves. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">10 early Block 60/65 F-14As
(BuNos 158613/158618, 158620, 158624, and 158626/158637) were
refurbished and modified to Block 130 standards for service with
VF-201 and VF-202 at NAS Dallas. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The original Tomcat
contract signed in 1969 covered 12 prototypes and options for 429
production aircraft at an agreed-upon fixed price. The
fixed-price contract was an innovation of the McNamara years at
the Defense Department. However, a wave of high inflation hit the
economies of the US and most Western nations during the early
1970s, and the price terms of the original contract soon became
unworkable and Grumman started losing money on each plane it
delivered to the Navy. In March of 1971, the company asked the
Navy to re-negotiate the contract. Initially, the Navy refused,
but Grumman angrily retorted that the company could not continue
much longer to deliver Tomcats at the promised price without
going out of business. In March of 1973 it reached a compromise
with the Navy under which the first 134 production aircraft would
be delivered under the original fixed price, with the price of
the follow-on Tomcats being re-negotiated with the Navy. The Navy
agreed to provide Grumman with a $200 million loan to keep the
company going until the re-negotiated prices became effective. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">This loan agreement stirred
up controversy in the press, with Grumman being accused (somewhat
unjustly) of turning around and investing the Navy loan it had
just received in short-term government securities for a quick
profit. In August of 1974, Congress voted to terminate the
Grumman loan as a result of the controversy. However, by this
time Grumman had a new customer for the Tomcat, the Shah of Iran.
The Iranian state Bank Melli provided a $75 million loan to
Grumman, and armed with this backing Grumman approached a
consortium of US banks and was able to get a loan for the
remaining $125 million, ensuring that the Tomcat program could
continue. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Three early F-14As were
delivered in the autumn of 1972 to VX-4 at NAS Point Mugu,
California for operational evaluation. The replacement squadron
VF-124 at NAS Miramar received its first Tomcats in June of 1972.
The job of VF-124 was to train Tomcat crews for duty with
operational carrier-based squadrons. The first two operational
Tomcat squadrons were VF-1 <i>Wolfpack </i>and VF-2 <i>Bounty
Hunters</i>, both based at NAS Miramar. These units deployed
aboard the USS <i>Enterprise </i>(CVN-65) in mid-1974. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The first East Coast
squadron to become operational with the Tomcat was VF-14 <i>Tophatters</i>,
joined shortly thereafter by VF-32 <i>Swordsmen</i>. These units
put to sea in June of 1975 aboard the USS <i>John F. Kennedy</i>
(CVA-67). Over the next nine years, almost all Navy deployable
fighter squadrons exchanged their Phantoms for Tomcats. The last
to do so were VF-21 and VF-154, which traded in their F-4Ns for
F-14As in September of 1983. Two new squadrons, VF-191 and
VF-194, were formed with F-14As in 1986, but were both disbanded
in April 1988 when budget cuts led to a reduction in force. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">F-14As began replacing F-4S
Phantoms in the reserves in October of 1984. Tomcats currently
equip four Reserve Fighter Squadrons, VF-201 and VF-202 at NAS
Dallas and VF-301 and VF-302 at NAS Miramar. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">As compared with the best
existing USN fighters, the Tomcat offered a 21 percent increase
in acceleration and sustained g-force, 20 percent increase in
rate of climb, 27 percent increase in maneuvering capability, and
a 40 percent improvement in turning radius. At a high throttle
setting, the Tomcat can hold a steady angle of attack of about 77
degrees. Maximum design speed of the Tomcat is Mach 2.4, but the
Navy sets a limit of about Mach 2.25 for service aircrew. The
aircraft can execute an 180-degree 6.5-g turn of 1800 feet radius
in 10 seconds without loss of speed. The Tomcat can hold 6.5 g at
Mach 2.2, and can accelerate from loiter to Mach 1.8 in 75
seconds. Armed with four Phoenix, two Sparrows, two Sidewinders,
and two external fuel tanks, the Tomcat can loiter on combat air
patrol for 90 minutes 280 km from the carrier, or for an hour at
a range of 470 km from the carrier. Tactical radius with the same
load on a deck-launched interception mission is 317 km with a
Mach 1.3 flyout. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The weak point of the
Tomcat was in its engines, which were initially a pair of
TF30-P-412 axial flow turbofans, rated at 12,350 lb.s.t. dry and
20,900 lb.s.t with afterburning. This engine was essentially
similar to the TF30-P-12 that had been used for the F-111B. With
this engine, the F-14A was decidedly underpowered. On several
occasions, fan blades had broken free from the shaft, damaging
the surrounding airframe structure and systems and causing the
loss of the aircraft. Very early in the flight test programs
there were problems encountered with engine stalls at high angles
of attack. These stalls would usually take place when coming
either in or out of afterburner or at low power settings when at
high angles of attack. These engine problems were exceedingly
vexing and resulted in the loss of several aircraft. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Beginning with production
block 65, the improved TF30-P-412A engine was fitted. During
block 95, which appeared in January of 1977, the P-414 version of
the TF30 became available. It incorporated modifications intended
to prevent turbine blade cracking and to contain any blade
failures that did occur. New compressor blades were made from a
revised titanium alloy. The engine contained steel cases wrapped
around the first three fan stages as a containment precaution in
the event of blades being thrown by the turbine. This engine was
first installed in BuNo 160396 (not the first aircraft in the
block 95 batch, as had been originally planned). Existing Tomcats
were retrofitted with the P-414, and the last TF30-P-412 powered
F-14A was finally out of service in the summer of 1979. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The problems with the
compressor stalls proved much more difficult to cure, and were
not really solved until 1984 when a new and improved variant of
the TF30 engine became available. The TF30 turbofan was an
extremely fussy engine, and had to be treated with great care by
the pilot if compressor stalls were to be avoided. Compressor
stalls could occur at any altitude/airspeed combination, but most
often they happened at high altitudes and low speeds, when
lighting or unlighting the afterburners, or after firing the
missiles. Sometimes the engine would immediately recover by
itself, but more often than not the stall would &quot;hang&quot;,
and the engine rpm would begin to decrease and the turbine inlet
temperature would start to rise. If not corrected immediately,
the aircraft would begin to yaw rapidly back and forth and the
aircraft could go into an uncontrollable spin from which the only
escape was generally for the crew to eject. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">If a low-speed compressor
stall took place, the first move for the pilot was to quickly
eliminate any g-loading on the aircraft to reduce the risk of an
uncontrollable spin, then to retard the throttles to idle in
order to reduce the asymmetric thrust, and then to turn the
stalled engine completely off, extinguishing the combustor flame
and reducing the turbine blade temperature so that the
engine--now deprived of its normal airflow--could not overheat
and be permanently damaged or perhaps even catch fire. If the
stall took place at supersonic speed, the recovery procedure was
similar, with the exception that it was not necessary to turn the
engines completely off since at supersonic speeds the airflow
through the engine is sufficient to cool the turbine. Once the
stall is cleared, a windmill engine restart can be attempted if
sufficient speed, altitude, and hydraulic pressure are available.
Alternatively, a spool-down airstart can be carried out as soon
as the turbine inlet temperature has cooled to acceptable levels.
If none of these measures worked, the only alternative would be
for the crew to eject. Of course, if any of this happened during
the stress of combat, the crew would be dead meat. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">An improved engine, the
TF30-P-414A, became available in early 1981. It involved minor
changes for improved reliability and durability, and was intended
to eliminate restrictions on how the pilot used engine power,
allowing Navy crews to fly their Tomcats through extreme angles
of attack and maneuver without having to worry about compressor
stalls. The first -414A engines were installed in the F-14A in
1984. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Even with the improved
-414A engine, It was found that excessive yaw can blank off the
outboard engine intake, leading to an engine flameout. At some
airspeed/power setting combinations this can lead to a violent
departure, which can lead into a non-recoverable flat spin if the
appropriate recovery actions are not taken within a couple of
seconds. Unlike many other interceptor aircraft, the Tomcat is
not completely optimized for high-speed, high-altitude flight. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Tomcat can be quite a
handful during carrier landings. Unlike the F-4 Phantom, the F-14
aircraft is not stable nor smooth during the glideslope while
coming in for a landing. It has relatively high pitch inertia and
tends to float. Its high residual thrust enforces the use of
relative low engine throttle settings during the approach,
resulting in poor engine response which makes recovery difficult
if something goes wrong. The poor lateral control makes precise
heading control difficult. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In 1980, a Tactical Air
Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS) was introduced. This was a
reconnaissance pod that could be attached to the underside of the
Tomcat on the left rear Phoenix missile station between the
engines. This pod was designed for low- to medium-altitude
reconnaissance and carried a KS-87 frame camera (vertical or
forward oblique), a KA-99 panoramic camera giving horizon to
horizon coverage, and an AAD-5 infrared line scanner. The TARPS
pod also carries an AN/ASQ-172 data display system. The pod is
controlled from stations installed in the rear cockpit. It
imposes very little penalty on aircraft performance or flight
characteristics and does not interfere with the carriage or
launch of the missiles. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">However, TARPS-capable
Tomcats must be specially wired in order to carry the pod. This
system was first deployed in the second half of 1981, with VF-84
aboard the <i>Nimitz </i>and with VF-122 aboard the <i>Constellation</i>.
With the retirement of the last RF-8G Crusaders in the spring of
1982, TARPS- equipped Tomcats became the Navy's primary tactical
reconnaissance system. One of the tasks assigned to
TARPS-equipped F-14As was the photograph Soviet long-rang
surveillance aircraft, documenting and cataloging the different
types of equipment carried by these aircraft. It is possible that
TARPS- equipped F-14As were used in Central America to spy on the
Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Tomcat initially
carried APR-25 and APR-27 radar warning receivers. These have
largely been replaced by the Magnavox ALR-50 which is designed to
warn crews of SAM launches. A major upgrade updated this
equipment to deal with the SA-6 <i>Gainful </i>missile and its
associated <i>Straight Flush</i> radar, which were initially so
successful against Israeli aircraft during the Yom Kippur War.
The Tomcat is equipped with the Goodyear ALE-39 chaff and flare
dispensing system, which has replaced the ALE-29 originally
carried. The Tomcat initially entered service with the Sanders
Associates ALQ-100 noise deception jammer, but this was later
replaced with the Sanders AN/ALQ-126A. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Tomcat was in service
just in time to see the closing stages of the Vietnam war in
1975. It flew top cover during Operation <i>Frequent Wind</i>,
the evacuation of US personnel from Saigon in April of 1975 just
before that city fell to the North. The North Vietnamese air
force did not interfere with the operation, but one Tomcat was
slightly damaged by antiaircraft fire. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">On September 14, 1976,
during a cruise off the Orkney Islands, Tomcat BuNo 159588 went
out of control while taxiing and rolled off the deck of the USS <i>John
F. Kennedy</i> and fell into the sea. The crew safely ejected
before the Tomcat went over the edge, but the plane ended up
intact on the ocean floor. Fearful that the Soviets might recover
the Tomcat and learn valuable secrets (especially about the
Phoenix missile), the Navy mounted a recovery operation designed
to fish the aircraft out of the water. After about two months,
the lost Tomcat was finally hauled back to the surface. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In August of 1981, the USS <i>Forrestal
</i>and <i>Nimitz </i>entered the Gulf of Sidra in the southern
Mediterranean to carry out routine training exercises. The Libyan
government claimed the entire Gulf of Sidra as its own
territorial waters, a claim which the US government did not
accept and chose to contest. Libyan aircraft were sent out to
monitor the operation. On August 19, two Libyan Su 22 Fitter- J
fighters were shot down by a pair of VF-41 Tomcats after one the
Fitters fired a missile at the American fighters. Both kills were
with AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles. This was the first air battle
between variable-geometry fighters.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In late 1983, Tomcats from
the USS <i>Eisenhower </i>and <i>Independence </i>flew numerous
missions over Lebanon in support of Marines stationed there.
TARPS-equipped Tomcats flew reconnaissance missions while other
F-14s flew top cover. The Tomcats were fired on by surface-to-air
missiles on several occasions, but none were hit. Open conflict
between Tomcats and Syrian fighters was avoided. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In April of 1983, two
Tomcats operating from the carrier USS <i>America </i>were fired
upon by Somali troops while flying over the port of Berbera on
the Gulf of Aden. These planes were on a prearranged mission, but
the Somali forces apparently mistook the Tomcats for Ethiopian
attackers. No Tomcats were hit. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">In combat operations in
Operation <i>Urgent Fury</i>, the invasion of Grenada in October
of 1983, TARPS-equipped Tomcats provided intelligence on troop
movements and gun emplacements for invading Marines and Army
Rangers. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The Tomcat was instrumental
in capturing the Palestinian terrorists who had hijacked the
Italian cruise liner <i>Achille Lauro </i>and had murdered an
American tourist. The hijackers had found refuge in Egypt, where
arrangements had been made to fly them to sanctuary in Libya
aboard an Egyptair Boeing 737 airliner. On October 19, 1985,
seven Tomcats from VF-74 and VF-103 flying from the USS <i>Saratoga
</i>(CV-60) intercepted the airliner and forced it to land at
Sigonella in Italy. Unfortunately, the intervention of Italian
guards prevented Delta Force commandos from snatching the
terrorists away to American soil for trial, but the terrorists
were prosecuted in Italy. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">During operations in the
Gulf of Sidra on March 24-26, 1986, numerous strikes were carried
out by Navy carrier-based aircraft against Libyan targets, with
Tomcats flying top cover, keeping Libyan fighters at bay and
dodging SAMs. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Operation <i>El Dorado
Canyon</i> took place against Libya on April 15, 1986, with USAF
F-111Fs attacking Tripoli while Navy strike aircraft went after
Benghazi. The latter raid was top-covered by F-14s. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">On January 4, 1989, two
F-14As (BuNos 159437 and 159610) from VF-32 flying off the <i>John
F. Kennedy</i> (CV-67) shot down a pair of Libyan MiG-23
Floggers. This action was the source of much controversy, since
the Libyan fighters did not this time actually fire on the
Tomcats. However, the maneuvering pattern of the MiGs in which
they repeatedly turned their noses toward the Tomcats even after
the F-14s deliberately turned away several times was deemed to be
indicative of hostile intent, and the Tomcats were given
clearance to fire. Both MiG pilots ejected safely, but the Libyan
Air Force was unable to recover them. The TCS provided valuable
documentation of the incident, and video tape images of the MiGs
demonstrated that they were indeed armed. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">There were some Sidewinder
firings by Tomcats flown by VF-21 operating aboard the USS <i>Independence</i>
(CV-62) during the 1988-1989 reflagged tanker escort operations
in the Persian Gulf. At one point, there was an engagement
between two VF-21 Tomcats and a pair of Iranian F-4s, with
Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles actually being fired. However,
these launches were all well out of parameters, and scored no
kills. So far as is known, USN and Iranian F-14s never challenged
each other. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">During Operation <i>Desert
Storm</i> of January 1991, Tomcats flew mostly top cover
operations in protection of the fleet's carriers and in the
escort of strike packages, and did not participate in very much
air-to-air combat. The Tomcats are credited with only one kill,
which came on February 6 when a pair of F-14s of VF-1 shot down a
Mil Mi-8 Hip helicopter with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. One F-14
Tomcat was lost in action on January 21 when it was shot down by
an Iraqi surface-to-air missile. The crew ejected safely, with
one crewman being picked up by helicopter and the other being
taken prisoner. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">The last F-14A (162711) was
delivered to the Navy on March 31, 1987. After that time, the
plans were for production was to shift over to the more advanced
F-14D version. However, Tomcat production was abruptly halted in
February of 1991 in an economy move. Originally, plans called for
the conversion of 400 F-14As to F-14D standards. However, only 18
F-14As have been converted to F-14D(R) configuration, and 32
other have been converted to F-14A Plus (F-14B) configuration. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">NASA had operated two F-14A
Tomcats at its Dryden Research Facility at Edwards AFB. BuNo
157991 arrived at Dryden on August 8, 1979, and was used in an
investigation of flight at low altitude and high angles of attack
under asymmetric thrust flight conditions. This plane was
returned to the Navy on September of 1985. BuNo 158613 was
delivered to Dryden on April 8, 1974 and was assigned the NASA
number of 834. It was used for a variable-sweep flight transition
experiment. It was returned to the Navy in September of 1987. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" face="Arial">Even today, the F-14A
Tomcat is still a potent fighter. Against aircraft such as the
F-4 or the MiG-23 <i>Flogger</i> the F-14A would have few
problems in maintaining air-to-air superiority, but its rate and
radius of turn, thrust-to-weight ratio, and high-angle of attack
capabilities would leave it at a serious disadvantage against
later aircraft such as the F-15, F-16, F/A-18, MiG-29 Fulcrum, or
Su-27 Flanker. Nevertheless, its BVR kill capacity is still
unmatched. </font></p>
