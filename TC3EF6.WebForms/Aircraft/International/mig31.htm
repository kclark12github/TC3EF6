<h3>Development</h3><p>


The Mig31 Foxhound is a very different aircraft to the <a HREF="images/mig25-1.jpg">Mig25 Foxbat</a> that it was modelled from.  It is an all weather, all altitude, two seater interceptor with advanced digital avionics.  It's airframe was extensively redesigned for supersonice flight at low level, for this the welded nickel steel content was reduced from 80% to 49%, with 16% titanium, 33% aluminium alloy and 2% composites.  The first Mig31 flew in 1975 with a N007 Zaslon radar that was the first eelectronically scanned phased array type radar to enter service in the World.  It could scan 198.4 km forward and track 10 targets simultanieously.  This radar could also tract and engage target flying behind and below the Aircraft.

<h3>Mig31 Foxhound</h3><p>

The Mig31M is an improved version of the basic Mig31.  It includes the new <a HREF="images/mig31rd.jpg">SBI-16 Zaslon radar</a> radar.  What make the Mig 31 such an effective aircraft is not features such as agility (which it is not renoun for) or speed (which it has plenty of!) but in it's weapons system of which the radar is a major part.  The Zaslon antenna is of the fixed type, instead of being mechanically directed the radar beam is moved electronically. 
This allows the full fuselage diameter to be used for the antenna, since antenna diameter and effective operating range are directly related it is a great advantage.  Electronic steerage of the radar beam is faster than can be performed mechanically, it is also more accurate.  All signal processing is digital.  As stated before the radar can track 10 targets and engage 4, the mission computer automatically selects the four most threatening targets. The  MiG-31 can engage targets spread over a greater area than can its Western equivalent, the F-14.<p>

Due to the Mig31's impressive radar, speed and ability to carry long range missiles they can cover a large swathe of terrotory.  In a flight of four aircraft Mig31s can cover a 900km front, sharing information through a digital datalink.  They can also act as an AWACs directing other fighters to targets.  For emmission free detection the Mig 31 is deployed with an IRST.  On the standard Mig31 this is semi retractable but on the Mig31M it is non retractable.  This long range fighter (fitted for in flight refueling) is one of the most expensive fighters that Russia has produced.  It is used soely by Russia.  The cockpits were upgraded in the Mig 31M with a number of <a HREF="images/mig31bc.jpg">Cathode Ray Tubes</a> (CRT) and an increased  <a HREF="images/mig31air.jpg">number</a> of missiles.<p>
