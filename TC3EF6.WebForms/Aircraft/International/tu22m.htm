<h3>Tu22M</h3><p>



The Tu22M is a medium range strike aircraft.  There are about 100 avaliable to the Air Force for theater strike, the Naval Forces have 165 for anti-shipping and carrier task group attacking.  The majority of these are the Tu22M3 (Backfire C) as opposed to the Tu22M2 (Backfire B).  While the Tu22M is a completely different aircraft it has it's origions in the <a HREF="images/tu22blind.jpg">Tu22</a> Blinder, a look at an early Backfire prototype can see the <a HREF="images/tu22m0.jpg">resembelance</a>.  The Tu22 Blinder was dissapointing in bomb load, speed and range.  The greatly <a HREF="images/tu22m3.jpg">changed</a> Backfire was intended to address these shortcommings.<p>

The Backfire is capable of nuclear strike, conventional attack and anti-ship missions.  It is the first of the large Russian aircraft with low level penetration capability.  This ability makes it a much more survivable aircraft than earlier Russian medium-heavy bombers such as the <a HREF="images/tu22blinder.jpg">Tu22</a> Blinder, <a HREF="images/tu16.jpg">Tu16</a> Badger and <a HREF="images/m4bison.jpg">M4</a> Bison.<p>

<strong>Tu22M2 (Backfire B)</strong>
This was the initial series production.  Was fitted with the 48 500 lb thrust NK-22 turbofans.  The engine intakes were slightly inclined and had large splitter plates.  The wingsweep was variable from 20 degrees to 65 degrees.  Armament was up to three of the early Kh-22 (AS-4 &quot;Kitchen&quot;) missiles.  These are massive missiles that deliver a large conventional warhead at high speed..  Alternatively the Tu22M2 is capable of carrying 46 300 lb of conventional bombs or mines.  At the rear of the aircraft there is a radar directed tail gun similar to those on the B-52.  It is a twin 23 mm turrent.<p>

<strong>Tu22M3 (Backfire C)</strong>
The <a HREF="images/tu22.jpg">Tu22M3</a> is a more advanced version that was deployed from 1983 onwards.  The air intakes were modified into more of a wedge shape, also the engines were upgraded to a more powerful models.  The nose was upturned and the maximum weapons load was also increased.  The radar directed tail turrent was redesinged into a more aerodynamic unit with one gun ontop of the other instead of side by side.  The Backfire C is also able to carry the Kh-15P (AS-16 &quot;Kickback&quot;) SRAM.  This has increased the total deliverable number of warheads.<p>

There is also an Electronic Warfare version with a semirecessed EW centerline pod.  There are also a number of extra fairings but as yet it is unknow exactly as to their purpose.<p>
