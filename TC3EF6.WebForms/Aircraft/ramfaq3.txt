Subject:  C.15.  What were the "new" fighters in _Hot Shots_?

They were Folland Gnats, an early British jet fighter that first flew in
1954 (as the Midge).  It was designed as a private venture by Folland, to
demonstrate that a lightweight fighter was a practical alternative to the
trend towards heavier and more complex aircraft.  It entered RAF service
only as a trainer (Gnat T.1), but both the fighter and trainer versions
were built under licence by HAL in India, as the Ajeet (unconquerable);
India, Finland, and Yugoslavia also imported British-built Gnat fighters
(as well as a reconnaissance version for Finland).  The trainer version
equipped the RAF's Red Arrows aerobatic team before the arrival of the
Hawk.  The Ajeet remains in service with India.  The Gnats seen in _Hot
Shots_ were all privately owned.

Vital statistics (Gnat F.1):  length 9.06 m, span 6.75 m, empty weight 2200
kg, max TO weight 4030 kg, max speed 1150 km/h, max range 1900 km; power
plant:  one 20.10 kN Bristol Orpheus 701 turbojet; armament:  two 30mm Aden
cannon (115 rounds each), four hardpoints, max external load 454 kg.

Subject:  C.16.  Why do the USAF/USN use incompatible refuelling systems?
Updated 1998 Feb 02

By far the most common method for in-flight refuelling is the
"probe-and-drogue" system, in which the tanker unreels a hose behind it
with a drogue on the end (a meshwork cone whose drag keeps the end of the
hose in a stable position). The receiving aircraft has a probe attached to
it, which is inserted into the drogue to link the fuel systems. Some
receiving aircraft have probes permanently mounted, some have bolt-on
probes that can be attached if a mission requires them, and some have
retractable probes. This method is used by the US Navy, modern Russian
aircraft, and every other country that uses in-flight refuelling
except those who operate aircraft fitted with the USAF "flying-boom"
system.

The US Air Force uses the "flying-boom" system. In this system, a
rigid boom, with control surfaces on the end, is extended from the tanker
and inserted into a socket on the receiving aircraft. This method has two
major disadvantages over the probe-and-drogue method. First, the boom has
to be attached directly to the tanker's fuselage, which prevents refuelling
from detachable pods attached to a tanker's wings (allowing more than one
receiver to link up at a time) or to the centreline hardpoint on a fighter
or strike aircraft (allowing such aircraft to refuel each other without a
dedicated tanker), both of which are commonly done with probe-and-drogue
refuelling. Second, the equipment on the receiving aircraft is
incompatible with the probe-and-drogue system, which means that USAF
aircraft can only recieve fuel from USAF tankers. 

USAF KC-10 tankers have both a boom and drogue on the centerline, so
they can give fuel to aircraft using either system on the same mission,
and some of them have also been fitted with underwing pods with drogues. 
USAF KC-135s can be fitted with a drogue on the boom, so it can deliver 
fuel to one of the two systems during a mission, and starting in 1996 USAF
KC-135Rs are being fitted with two underwing pods with drogues so they 
also can refuel aircraft using either system, at the same time.

The reason why the USAF puts up with this is that the flying-boom system
can achieve much greater fuel flow rates than the probe-and-drogue system
(mainly because the rigid boom is shorter and wider than the flexible
hose). This is mainly for the benefit of large bombers such as the B-52
and B-1; refuelling such large aircraft by probe-and-drogue would take much
longer, enough (in the USAF's judgement) to cause significant tactical
problems. Few other air forces operate aircraft of similar size; the
handful that do are prepared to live with the refuelling delays in the
interests of compatibility.
Another reason is that the basket on the drogue is vulnerable to blow-out 
if the probe contacts the drogue incorrectly, and when the basket blows, 
the drogue becomes highly unstable and useless.
It's also been said that for large aircraft, it's easier if they don't 
have to fly a probe into a drogue and hold it there, but that doesn't
seem to an issue nowadays, and Russian pilots says it's much easier
than the wingtip to wingtip system.

The RAF deploys two sizes of IFR system aboard its tankers - a thin one
for fighters, and a wider bore one for transports / Nimrods / Sentry.

The third refuelling system used is the "wingtip-to-wingtip" system, used
only by older Russian bombers. In this system, a hose is unreeled from one
wingtip of the tanker, and caught by a socket in the opposite wingtip of
the receiver; the two aircraft then fly side by side, with the hose joining
their wingtips (the length of the hose is comparable to the wingspan of the
aircraft). The tankers are all converted bombers (Tu-16 Badgers) 
themselves, and Tu-16 Badgers are the only operational bombers to 
receive fuel this way. This system is very tricky to link up,
occasionally dangerous, only usable with bombers (smaller aircraft can't
carry the necessary receiving equipment on their wingtips), and gives flow
rates even worse than probe-and-drogue; not surprisingly, the Russians have
largely replaced it with the probe-and-drogue system, and it will probably
become extinct with the retirement of the last Tu-16 Badgers, tankers 
and bombers both.

Subject:   C.18.  Do Harriers VIFF in combat?

No. While VIFFing *could* cause an enemy to overshoot, it bleeds so much
energy that it makes the Harrier a sitting duck. It was not used during
the Falklands (source: Cdr `Sharky' Ward, 801 Sqn). The current consensus,
accepted by P. Bowen (an ex-Harrier pilot) is that VIFFing might be usable
in a `once-off save your life' manoeuvre, but it is generally a poor combat
tactic.

------------------------------

C.19. Is the A-10 actually braked by the gun recoil?

No, not noticably. Pilots report no speed loss even during long bursts.
   A 70 round burst of 0.4 kg shells fired at 1000 m/s corresponds to
to a speed reduction of a 15 ton aircraft of 0.2 m/s, which is less than 
half a knot.

------------------------------
C.20. Are the KC-135s Boeing 707s?
(Entry new 1999-11-22)

No. The C-135 family has a resemblance to the Boeing 707 (and 720) family, 
but they are not identical. The Boeing model number for KC-135 is Boeing 717, 
and for some, ex C-135Bs and RC-135s, Boeing 739. 

The model number 717 has now been "reused" and given to what was previously 
the McDonnell Douglas MD-95, as the number hasn't been used in the commercial 
airliner division of Boeing before, only in the military division.

Note that the C-137, E-3, E-6 and E-8 are Boeing 707s.

The differences between the families (367-80 was the prototype) include:
                                  367-80    717/739    707/720
Fuselage upper lobe width         132 in    144 in     148 in
         cross-sectional height   164 in    168 in     170.5 in
The 367-80, 707-120 and KC-135 have almost the same wing, but the
720 has a wing root glove and the 707-320 and -420 a different
inner wing and tip planform and airfoil shape.
The KC-135 fuselage is the same length as 367-80's.  The 707-138 and
720 are 20 inches longer, the 707-120 is 120 inches longer and the
707-320 and -420 are 200 inches longer.
Also the types of aluminium alloy used in the KC-135 and 707 are different.

KC-135s first had J57s (JT3Cs) without thrust reversers. Some were
reengined with TF33s (JT3Ds) with thrust reversers (from scrapped 707s), 
others got F108s (CFM56s), without thrust reversers. 367-80 and all 
early 707s and 720s were powered by JT3Cs, with thrust reversers. Most 
were reengined with JT3Ds, with thrust reversers. 707-320s were powered by JT3Ds, 
while -420s were powered by RR Conways, both with thrust reversers. Some military 707s 
(RAF and French E-3s, USN E-6s and one E-8C) were built with F108s (CFM56s).

Subject: C.21.  What do the designations F-16CG and F-16CJ stand for?

The unofficial designations F-16CG and F-16CJ refers to
F-16 Block 40/42 and Block 50/52 respectively. (Block 40 and
50 uses GE engines, 42 and 52 P&W engines.) F-16CG is fitted
for LANTIRN (enabling it to do night attacks for example), 
F-16CJ is fitted with an improved data modem, ALR-56 RWR
and Harm Targetting System (HTS) enabling it for the SEAD
role.

Subject:  C.22. Which aircraft can supercruise?
(New 2001 Aug 24)

The definition of supercruise

Engineers have always considered supercruise to mean flying 
supersonically -- that is with all airflow around the airframe
supersonic (subsonic = no supersonic airflow, transsonic =
some airflow supersonic; So different aircraft goes supersonic
at different speeds, all faster than Mach 1, typically around
Mach 1.3) -- without the use of afterburner.
   There is no clear agreement whether afterburner can be used
to accellerate through the transsonic region or not, but it doesn't
seem unreasonable to allow it, since the definition is about
the cruise phase.

In more recent times some people have started to use another
definition, one meaning anything faster than Mach 1 without afterburner,
usually as to include some aircraft in the very small group of
supercruisers.

Supercruising aircraft

Using the strict definition the supercruisers include
Concorde and F-22.
   If one includes anything faster than Mach 1 the list becomes
longer with English Electric Lightning (M 1.2), Lockheed F-104A
with J79-19 engine (M 1.05 at altitude), probably Draken, 
F/A-18C/D Hornet with F404-402 engines, F-15E Eagle with CFTs 
and LANTIRN either -220 or -229 engines (with the -229 engines 
it's reported to have accelerated to M 1.15 from subsonic and 
from supersonic speeds with afterburner slowed down to M 1.3 
when the afterburner was turned off), Gripen, Eurofighter Typhoon, 
Rafale and likely others.
   This is of course depending on altitude, weights and external
loads and exact numbers are usually classified.

Subject:  D.1.  Is aircraft X still in service?

* Blackburn Buccaneer:  NO -- The last squadron of Buccaneers in RAF
service was disbanded in early 1994.  South Africa, the only other
Buccaneer user, had already disposed of its aircraft by then.

* Boeing B-29 Superfortress:  SORT OF -- China still has 15 Russian-built
B-29 copies (Tu-4) on its inventory; these are now used entirely for
training and research.  One was fitted with a pylon-mounted disk for AEW
radar experiments.

* Convair F-106 Delta Dart:  NO -- The last aircraft in US service
were retired in 1988.  About 180 were converted to QF-106 target drones;
most were destroyed by 1994, and the last ones were dumpted in the ocean 
at the end of 1997. The last flyable F-106 of all (flying with NASA) 
was retired in the late summer/fall of 1998.

* Dassault Ouragan:  YES -- El Salvador still has two Ouragans in
service.

* De Havilland Vampire:  NO -- There are no Vampires in military service;
several are still flying in private hands.

* De Havilland Venom:  NO -- There are no Venoms in military service;
several are still flying in private hands.

* English Electric Canberra:  YES -- The Canberra is still in service with
Chile, India (largest user, with 46), Peru, and the UK.  The 20
aircraft on the British inventory are used for training and photographic
reconnaissance, not in the bomber role. As of 1 Apr 1996, the RAF has 
9 Canberra, a mix of PR.7 and PR.9.
Argentina retired its last one on 5th April 2000.

* Grumman S-2 Tracker:  YES -- Eight countries still have S-2s in service.
Many retired examples have been converted to civilian firebombers.

* Handley Page Victor:  NO -- The RAF retired its last Victor K.2 tanker on
30 November 1993.

* Hawker Hunter:  YES -- The Hunter is still in service with India.
Lebanon and Somalia still have a handful of Hunters listed, but these are 
almost certainly unserviceable.  
Chile, Oman and Switzerland have retired theirs in the 1990's.
The handful of Hunters still flying in the UK are operated
by civilian organisations.

* Ilyushin Il-28 ("Beagle"):  YES -- The Chinese-built Hong-5 is in service
in large numbers (about 650) with China, as well as North Korea and
Romania (confirmed in 2000), but only Egypt still operates five 
Russian-built Il-28s.

* Lockheed F-104 Starfighter:  YES -- Remains in service with Greece,
Italy, Taiwan, and Turkey (largest user, with 220).
Taiwan will retire her entire F-104 fleet in 1997.  Currently, only
a small number of RF-104G and TF-104G are in active service.  The
single-seaters (mostly G) are placed on partial curtailment to
prolong service life and reduce accident rates.

* Lockheed P-2 Neptune:  YES -- Japan still flies 14 of its locally-built
P-2J version.

* Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird:  SORT OF -- These were retired from USAF
service in 1990.  Three aircraft were transferred to NASA, and are used for
atmospheric research.  Currently (June '94) there seems to be serious talk
of reactivating some USAF SR-71s for reconnaissance, probably in connection
with the Korean situation.

* Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star:  YES -- 14 countries still use T-33s for
training; the largest user is Japan, with 113.

* Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 ("Fagot/Midget"):  YES -- About 20 countries
operate the MiG-15UTI trainer; two (Albania and Cuba) still operate 
the single-seat fighter.  Romanian MiG-15s haven't been uses since 1991.
All Chinese MiG-15s have been retired
(see also section H.11).

* Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 ("Fresco"):  YES -- About 25 countries still use
the MiG-17, or the Chinese-built J-5.  The Chinese PLA Air Force only
operates the JJ-5 trainer version.

* Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 ("Farmer"):  YES -- The Chinese J-6 is still in
service with 14 countries, but only Cuba still flies the genuine article
(about 30).  Production of the J-6 stopped about 1981.

* Myasishchyev M-3/4 ("Bison"):  YES -- The last M-3M and M-4 "Bison-A"
bombers and M-3MD "Bison-C" maritime patrol aircraft were retired or
converted in 1987.  A small number of M-3MS-2 "Bison-B" tankers remain in
service with the Russian AF, but are being replaced by the Il-78T "Midas",
and will probably be gone by the end of 1994.  A few aircraft (possibly
only one) have been converted to M-3VM-T Atlant heavy transports; these
remain in use, mainly for transporting space hardware, pending the
manufacture of more An-225 transports.

* North American F-86 Sabre:  NO -- The Bolivian Air Force its last
three F-86Fs around 1996.

* North American F-100 Super Sabre:  NO -- Turkey, the last operator of the
F-100, disposed of its aircraft in 1989.

* Saab Lansen: NO. -- About 25 (the last built in 1960) 
of the fighter version were in Swedish service as target towing, ECM 
and trials aircraft. The ECM/aggressor sqn was disbanded in summer
1997 and almost all of them retired. A small number were retained by
the trials establishement until 1999.

* Sukhoi Su-7 ("Fitter/Moujik"):  YES -- Only Algeria, Iraq, and North
Korea (largest user, with 30) still fly the Su-7.

* Sukhoi Su-15 ("Flagon"):  NO -- This was withdrawn from Russian service
about 1992.

* Tupolev Tu-128 ("Fiddler"):  NO -- This was withdrawn from Russian
service about 1992.

* Vought A-7 Corsair II:  YES -- In service with Greece (largest user, with
85) and Portugal.  The last A-7s in US service were withdrawn at the end of
1993.

* Vought F-8 Crusader:  YES -- 19 F-8E(FN) Crusaders serve with the French
Navy, and are expected to remain in service until the Rafale M is available
in 1999.

* Yakovlev Yak-28 ("Brewer/Firebar/Maestro"):  NO -- The last Yak-28P
"Firebar" interceptors were withdrawn in the 1980s, the last Yak-28R
"Brewer-D" reconnaissance aircraft about 1990, and the last Yak-28PP
"Brewer-E" electronic warfare aircraft (along with the last Yak-28U
"Maestro" trainers) about 1992.

* Yakovlev Yak-38 ("Forger"):  NO -- The Russian Navy retired the last of
its Yak-38 fleet around the end of 1993.

Subject:  D.2.  Did one of the XB-70 prototypes crash during a photo shot?

On 8 June 1966, XB-70 AV/2 (Air Vehicle 2) took part in a publicity flight
involving five aircraft powered by General Electric engines, over the
Mojave Desert.  The aircraft were flying in a V formation; from left to
right, a Northrop T-38A Talon, a McDonnell Douglas F-4B Phantom II, the
North American XB-70 Valkyrie, a Lockheed F-104N Starfighter, and a
Northrop F-5A Freedom Fighter.  Two more aircraft, a Learjet and an F-104D,
carried photographers.

At 9:26 a.m., just after the end of the photo session, with no warning or
explanation, the F-104N's tail hit the XB-70's right wingtip.  The F-104
flipped over and passed above the XB-70, slicing off parts of both of its
vertical fins on the way, then rammed into its port wing several times.
The XB-70 then flipped over and began spinning, spraying fuel from the
ruins of its port wing.  Both aircraft dived into the ground.

The command pilot of AV/2, Al White (North American's test pilot), ejected
and survived, although he suffered back injuries when the air bag that
should have served as shock absorber on his ejection capsule failed.  He
said later that the other pilot, Major Carl Cross (USAF), was slumped
forward in his seat; White tried to activate Cross's ejection capsule but
was unable to do so before he had to eject himself.  It was speculated that
Cross had suffered a blow to the head, or was incapacitated by G forces.
The F-104N pilot, Joseph A Walker (NASA's chief research pilot) was
apparently killed in the initial collision.

The collision is believed to have been caused by the F-104 getting too
close to the XB-70 and getting caught in its wingtip vortices, but nobody
knows for certain.

The surviving XB-70, AV/1 (tail number 20001), is on display at the Air
Force Museum at Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.

Subject:  D.3.  Jet powered sea planes

Saunders-Roe SR.A/1  ("Philip R Morten" <pmorten@VNET.IBM.COM>)
                                                                        
The SR.A/1 is an example of one of the rarest categories of  aircraft - 
a jet fighter flying-boat  - and is also one of Britain's earliest jet  
aircraft. This wartime design was intended to operate from islands or   
depot ships in remote parts of the world but was not completed until the
war was over.  The three aircraft built were used for experimental      
purposes for several years.                                             
                                                                        
SR.A/1 was designed by Saunders-Roe of Cowes, Isle of Wight during 1943.
The design was accepted by the Ministry in 1944 and five (later reduced 
to three) prototypes were ordered.  Construction was at Cowes and the   
first example flew from the Solent on 16th July 1947.  The SR.A/1 was   
demonstrated at the Farnborough air show in 1947 and 1948 where test    
pilot Geoffrey Tyson thrilled the crowds with his low-level inverted    
flypasts.                                                               
                                                                        
Flight tests of all three prototypes proceeded until August 1949 when   
both the second and third aircraft were lost in accidents, one sinking  
after hitting a floating object while landing on the Solent and the     
other after loss of control during an aerobatic display practice. Around
this time the Ministry lost interest in the project, and also           
effectively cancelled development of the Beryl engine, but Saunders-Roe 
brought the first prototype out of storage for trials of their own for  
which purposes it received the "B-Conditions" civil registration G-12-1.
These trials continued until 1951 when, after  being displayed at the   
Festival of Britain site on the Thames, it was retired to the  College  
of Aeronautics at Cranfield.                                            
                                                                        
The SR.A/1 is also noteworthy in that it  was the first British aircraft
to be fitted  with a production ejection-seat and  was the only aircraft
designed to fly with the  Metrovick Beryl axial flow jet engine,        
probably the most advanced aero engine in the world at the time.  Both  
the seat and the engine are displayed in the Museum alongside the       
aircraft.                                                               
                                                                        
TG263 is the first, and sole surviving, example of the three SR.A/1s.   
When trials were complete it was presented to the College of Aeronautics
at Cranfield where it was used as an instructional  airframe until      
1966 when it was purchased by Peter Thomas for his Skyfame Aircraft     
Museum at Staverton.   In 1978 it was purchased by the Trustees of the  
Imperial War Museum and  transferred to their museum at Duxford,        
Cambridgeshire where it was restored to its original service markings.
In 1993 it was made available to the Southampton Hall of Aviation so  
that it could be displayed at the museum closest to its original home.

Subject:  E.1.  What jet aircraft were the Germans working on during WW2?
Updated 1998 Nov 20, 2001 Nov 26

* Arado Ar 234 Blitz (Lightning):  The world's first jet bomber.  First
flight, 15 June 1943; service entry, September 1944.  The two versions to
see service, the Ar 234B-1 unarmed reconnaissance aircraft and B-2 bomber,
were single-seat aircraft powered by two 8.83 kN thrust Jumo 004B
turbojets.  The Ar 234C series, with four 7.85 kN BMW 003A-1 turbojets,
never reached service, although several prototypes flew.  210 Ar 234s were
completed before the end of the war; the Ar 234 was involved in the Battle
of the Bulge, the destruction of the Remagen bridge, and several other
battles and at least one Ar 234C made a reconnaissance mission.  
Plans included the Ar 234C-1 reconnaissance plane, C-2 bomber,
and C-3 in bomber, ground attack, and night fighter subtypes; a C-3 variant
carrying a V-1 cruise missile on its back was also planned.  Other
proposals included the Ar 234D (two Heinkel HeS 011A turbojets), Ar 234E
(fighter based on Ar 234D), Ar 234P (night fighter), and the Ar 234R 
which was a rocket powered recon version (without the jets) which was
in direct competition with the DFS 228 (and lost).

Vital statistics (Ar 234B-2):  length 12.65 m, span 14.20 m, empty weight
5200 kg, max weight 8410 kg, max speed 742 km/h, range 1630 km; 
armament: 1500 kg bomb load.

The typical Ar 234B had no guns; there were a handful field modified with
a 20mm (or 30mm) gun-pack in the bomb recess and the 234B-N nightfighter
had a similar gun pack. The 234C would have had (eventually) two 20
or 30mm cannon in the nose, just under and to the sides of the pilot.


* Bachem Ba 349 Natter (Viper):  This was a tiny, extremely short-range
rocket-powered interceptor.  It was designed to be launched vertically,
fire its rocket armament into a bomber formation, and then come apart in
mid-air; the forward section would be thrown away, the rear section would
descend by parachute to be re-used, and the pilot would descend on his 
own parachute. The initial version, the Ba 349A, was powered by four 11.77 
kN Schmidding 109-533 booster rockets and one 16.67 kN Walter 109-509A-2 
sustainer rocket; 20 of this version were built, the Ba 349B had a 509C motor, 
with cruise setting, doubling endurance. There were plans for a Ba 349C with 
a more powerful rocket and a larger tail for better control.
   Data for Ba 349A
Time to 11.000 m:     60 s
Max speed:          1000 km/h
Range:             20-80 km depending on altitude
Endurance:           130 s at 800 km/h at 3000 m
Take off weight:    2230 kg including boosters
Empty weight:        880 kg
Internal fuel:       750 kg
Weapons:             185 kg  24 x 73 mm Föhn rockets 
                          or 33 x 55 mm R4M rockets
Solid fuel boosters: 495 kg
Length:                6.02 m
Span:                  4.0 m

* DFS 228:  High-altitude, air-launched reconnaissance aircraft with a
rocket engine, in development during 1945. Claimed are a ceiling of 
20000 m, a speed of 1000 km/h, and a range of 720 km -- but no DFS 228, 
and few documents, survived the war.

* DFS 346:  A 1945 design for an aircraft with two 20 kN Walter rocket
engines, swept wings and a prone pilot position.  It had an estimated top
speed of Mach 2.6 at 30500 m. The incomplete prototype was captured by the
USSR and test flown, with one of the interned B-29s as launch aircraft
and a variant of it was built and flown.

* Fieseler Fi 103R Reichenberg:  Basically a manned version of the Fi 103
("V-1") flying bomb (the first cruise missile).  In theory, this wasn't a
Kamikaze-style suicide weapon, since the pilot was intended to bail out
after aiming the aircraft/missile at its target.  In practice, this would
have presented certain difficulties, since the cockpit was placed directly
underneath the jet intake!  The engine was the same one used on the V-1,
one 2.94 kN As 109-014 pulse-jet.  Versions planned were the Fi 103R-I and
R-II training gliders, R-III powered trainer, and R-IV operational version.
About 175 were built, and a few test flights were made by the R-III, but
none flew operationally.

Vital statistics (for the V-1; the Fi 103R-IV would have been very
similar):  length 7.90 m, span 5.30 m, weight 2180 kg, max speed 645 km/h,
range 240 km; armament:  850 kg warhead.

* Focke-Wulf Ta 183: Single-seat jet fighter powered by one 12.75 kN
Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet. Planned versions included the Ta 183A-1 and A-2
fighters, and A-3 photo-reconnaissance version. It is unlikely a 
prototype was assembled, much less flew. Luftwaffe selected the 
Messerschmidt P.1101 instead of the Ta 183.

Vital statistics (Ta 183A-1):  length 9.20 m, span 10.00 m, max weight 4300
kg, max speed 954 km/h, range 722 km; armament:  four 15mm or 20mm cannon
or two 30mm cannon; 500 kg bomb load.

The Saab 29 and MiG-15 resembles the Ta 183 slightly, but they're
different enough that they cannot have been based on it, at most inspired, 
but certainly German aerodynamic data contributed to their design.

* Heinkel He 162 Salamander:  A tiny, single-engine fighter, famous for the
speed of the development programme -- the first prototype flew on 6
December 1944, less than three months after the requirement was issued!  It
was intended to be a "Volksjäger" (people's fighter) that could be flown by
Hitler Youth volunteers after minimal training; fortunately for the youths
concerned, the war ended before this plan could be put into action.  280
aircraft were completed before the end of the war (and another 800 were
found in various stages of completion in the factories), but only a handful
actually saw combat, in the hands of expert pilots.  By all accounts the
Salamander had lousy handling characteristics and was difficult for even
experienced pilots to fly.  In addition, the high-tech glue used to make
the wooden laminate wings in the prototypes was replaced with a cheaper
type in the production aircraft, resulting in frequent catastrophic
failures.  Versions built were the He 162A-1 and A-2, both powered by one
7.85 kN BMW 003E-1 or E-2 turbojet (differing only in being armed with two
30mm or two 20mm cannon, respectively); proposals included the He 162B (one
or two pulse-jet engines), He 162C (forward-swept wings), He 162D
(swept-back wings), and various combinations of jet and rocket propulsion.

Vital statistics (He 162A-2):  length 9.00 m, span 7.20 m, empty weight
2180 kg, max weight 2695 kg, max speed 784 km/h, range 695 km; armament:
two 20mm cannon.

* Heinkel He 280:  The first jet fighter to fly, the He 280 was powered by
two 8.24 kN Junkers Jumo 004 turbojets.  Development was delayed, and
eventually abandoned in favour of the superior Me 262.

Vital statistics (He 280 V6):  max speed 817 km/h; armament:  three 20mm
cannon.

* Henschel Hs 132:  A dive bomber powered by a single 7.85 kN BMW 003A-1
turbojet, the Hs 132 was built along the same general lines as the He 162,
with the engine mounted dorsally on the fuselage.  The unique feature was a
prone pilot position, intended to improve G tolerance.  The factory was
overrun by the Soviet Army shortly before the first flight was planned.

Vital statistics:  Max speed 700 km/h; armament:  one 500 kg bomb.

* Horten Ho IX (also inaccurately sometimes known as Gotha Go 229):  
A flying wing fighter of futuristic and elegant appearance. It had a flat, 
tailless design, and was intended to be constructed mainly of wood, 
with special glues and lacquers to minimise radar signature -- in other 
words, it was the first stealth fighter!  

Only one prototype flew, the Ho IX V2, the first flight in January 1945
went very well, but in a later unauthorised flight it crashed during
an emergency landing.
The prototype was powered by two 8.73 kN Jumo 004B turbojets (which would 
also have powered the production Ho 229 versions). Production of the 
fighter was assigned to the Gotha factory; versions planned were the 
single-seat Ho 229A day fighter, and the two-seat, radar-equipped 
Go 229B night fighter. 
Gotha had a mofified Ho 229 in the works -- a two to three seat night 
fighter called the P.60 - which was based on the Horten design.

A captured prototype rests at Silver Hill, Maryland, USA.

Vital statistics (Go 229A-0):  empty weight 4600 kg, max weight 7507 kg,
max speed 977 km/h, range 1900 km; armament:  four 30mm cannon; 2000 kg
bomb load.

* Horten Ho X:  Single-engined flying wing fighter, basically a slightly
scaled-down Ho IX.  None were built.

* Horten Ho XVIII "Amerika bomber":  Six-engine flying wing bomber.  Apart
from the curved trailing edge, this design bore an amazing resemblance to
the Northrop B-2.  None were built, although the first prototype was under
construction at the end of the war.  Rumour has it this aircraft was
intended to carry the German atomic bomb to America, but this is very
implausible, as at that time the Germans didn't know large or heavy
an atomic bomb would have been, and you can't design an aircraft
without knowing the indended payload!

Vital statistics:  range 11900 km; armament:  3600 kg bomb load.

* Junkers Ju 287:  A heavy jet bomber, unusual in having forward swept
wings.  A single prototype flew before the end of the war (a second was
completed and flown in Russia after the war).  The prototype was built
largely from salvaged parts, including an He 177 fuselage, a Ju 388 tail
part of the landing gear came from a crashed B-24. 
It was powered by four turbojets, one under each wing and one on either 
side of the nose; planned versions included several different 
arrangements of two, four, or six engines.

* Lippisch P13a:  This one takes the prize (any prize).  It was a
ramjet-powered, sharply swept delta, with the cockpit built into the tail
fin.  It was powered by coal gas generated from solid fuel, and had a
nominal design speed of 1650 km/h.  Yes, you read that right -- a
coal-powered supersonic fighter.  A small rocket engine was provided for
take-off.  Alas, it never flew.  The DM-1 glider, built along the same
general lines and intended to validate the airframe design, was completed
after the war and test-flown in the US; some results were published in
_Lippisch P13a and Experimental DM-1_ by Hans-Peter Dabrowski (Schiffer
Military History; ISBN 0-88740-479-0).  Aerodynamic testing in a
wind-tunnel took place at Langley field, by what was then NACA, in 1946.
Results were "disappointing", but led eventually to the successful delta
wing concept.

Vital statistics:  length 6.7 m, span 6.0 m, max speed 1650 km/h (Mach
1.55; this was the original design speed, although wind tunnel tests went
up to Mach 2.6), range 1240 km; armament:  two cannon.

* Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet:  The only rocket-powered aircraft ever to
enter service.  First flight, early 1941; service entry, May 1944.  Unusual
in appearance as well as propulsion, it had a short fuselage with swept
wings and no horizontal tail; despite the tailless design, it had excellent
flight characteristics and was reportedly very easy to fly.  Landing was a
different matter, though -- the awkward centreline skid arrangement (to
save weight, the wheeled trolley used for take-off was jettisoned once the
plane was airborne), combined with the presence of highly volatile and
explosive rocket fuel, resulted in many Komets living up to their name and
ending their days as fireballs.  In the air, however, the combination of
tremendous speed, small size, and the element of surprise made them
reasonably successful against American bomber formations, on the few
occasions they entered combat.  There was only one service version, the Me
163B-1, powered by one 16.67 kN Walter HWK 509A-2 liquid fuel rocket; about
370 of these saw service.  Plans existed for a greatly improved version,
the Me 263 (also known as the Junkers Ju 248; Junkers did much of the
development work), with a new engine (16.67 kN Walter HWK 109-509C-4, with
separate boost and cruise chambers, giving a longer (30+ min?) endurance), 
more fuel, and a real landing gear. There was one Me 263 built and 
flown, but it was only flown as a glider; the engine was not ignited in 
flight. 
The Russians used the Me 263 as the basis of their I-270 rocket interceptor.

Vital statistics (Me 163B-1):  length 5.69 m, span 9.30 m, empty weight
1905 kg, max weight 4110 kg, max speed 960 km/h, range 100 km; armament:
two 30mm cannon.

* Messerschmitt Me 262 Schwalbe (Swallow):  The first jet fighter to enter
service with any country.  First flight, 4 April 1941; service entry, 30
June 1944.  The Me 262 was much faster and more heavily armed than the
contemporary Gloster Meteor, and could have had a much greater effect on
the war than it actually did if it had been produced in larger numbers in
time.  The story that delays were caused by Hitler's insistence that the
promising fighter be used only as a bomber appears to be a myth.  The Me
262 was designed as a versatile fighter-bomber from the start; delays were
mainly caused by the difficulty of manufacturing the engines in large
enough quantities in the face of materials shortages caused by Allied
bombing (the service life of an engine was only about 20 hours!).  The Me
262 was also the first aircraft in service with swept wings, although this
came about by accident -- a redesign of the fuselage happened to move the
centre of gravity further back than had originally been intended (an early
design had the engines mounted in the wing roots), and the wings were
angled slightly back to compensate; it was only later that it was
discovered that this had fortuitously improved the aerodynamics.  Not quite
enough, though; transonic aerodynamics were not considered in the design,
and the Me 262 became effectively uncontrollable in a shallow dive, some
pilots having to jettison the canopy to recover from spins!  Variants to
see service were the Me 262A-1a fighter, A-2a fighter-bomber, B-1a two-seat
trainer, and B-1a/U1 radar-equipped night fighter, all powered by two 8.83
kN Junkers Jumo 004B turbojets.  Although 1433 Me 262s had been delivered
by VE day, shortage of fuel (and pilots) meant that only about 100 of them
ever saw active service.  Plans included the Me 262B-2a night fighter with
enlarged fuselage carrying more fuel and Schräge Musik upward-firing
cannon, and Me 262C with rocket boosters (a few prototypes flew before the
war ended).

Vital statistics (Me 262A-1a):  length 10.60 m, span 12.50 m, empty weight
4000 kg, max weight 7045 kg, max speed 870 km/h, range 1050 km; armament:
four 30mm cannon.

* Messerschmitt Me 328:  This was a short-lived design, powered by two 2.94
kN Argus As 014 pulse-jets and intended to be a cheap and quickly-built
ground attack aircraft, with a secondary role as a day fighter.  Only one
prototype flew, sometime in 1944; this was enough to convince even the
desperate Germans that a pulse-jet powered fighter was a Dumb Idea.

Vital statistics (Me 328A-1):  max speed 755 km/h; armament:  two 15mm
machine guns.

* Messerschmitt P.1101: Jet fighter powered by one Junkers Jumo 004B
turbojet, mounted in the lower forward fuselage and fed by a nose inlet, in
a design similar to the post-war Yak-17 or Saab 29. The unique feature was
the variable geometry wings, the first time "swing wings" had been tried on
an aircraft.  Only one prototype was completed before the P-1101 was
cancelled in favour of the Focke-Wulf Ta 183; it was never flown during the
war, but was taken back to the US and fitted with an Allison J35 turbojet,
but not flown as it had been damaged in transport. The Bell X-5
was based on the P.1101's design, and was successfully used to investigate
variable sweep. The P.1101 prototype (unlike the X-5) lacked true variable
geometry; the sweep angle could only be adjusted on the ground, and could
not be varied in flight. The cancelled production version would have had
true variable sweep.

* Mistel 5:  This was an unmanned flying bomb, intended to carry an He 162
fighter piggyback, in the same way as the Me 109 or Fw 190 was coupled with
a warhead-carrying Ju 88 in the original Mistel versions.  The He 162 pilot
would aim the missile at its target, then separate the two aircraft and fly
his fighter back home.  The unmanned component is referred to by different
sources as either the Arado E-377a or the Junkers Ju 268.  Power plant was
two BMW 003 turbojets.  This one never left the drawing board.

Some surviving examples of German jets can be seen at the NASM facility in
Silver Hill, Maryland, USA, where they have a restored Ar 234, 
a Ba 349 and He 162 waiting to undergo restoration.
For those interested in plastic modelling, the Dragon
line of kits includes many of the above types (Ar 234B/C/C+V1, Ba 349, Fi
103, Go 229A/B, He 162, Me 163, Me 262A/B, Mistel 5, P-1101) in 1/48 or
1/72 scale; the Japanese company Mauve produce a 1/48 kit of the Lippisch
P13a; PM Models make a Ta 183 kit.

A few other projects are worthy of note.  The A4b was a winged A4 ("V-2")
rocket, with a gliding trajectory giving it a range of 750 km, compared to
the A4's 33 km.  It was test flown in 1945 but never used in the war.  A
winged rocket was reported to reach 4340 km/h (Mach 4.1), although it isn't
clear whether this was the A4b or A10.

The A9/A10 was a planned two-stage missile; the first stage (A10) was
basically a scaled-up V-2, while the second stage (A9) was a winged
skip-glide re-entry vehicle, based on the A4b, that could have carried a
massive warhead (how large?) to the United States.
Prototype versions of the two components were tested separately, but not
together. There were also plans for a manned version.

The Sänger-Bredt "spaceplane" was a design for a manned craft launched by a
captive rocket booster on rails; the booster remained on the ground after
the spaceplane separated (at about Mach 1.5!).  The 100-tonne plane (of
which 90 tonnes was fuel) would not reach orbit, but would attain a maximum
altitude of 185 kilometres in a series of boosts and glides which would
carry it all the way around the world.  It was designed as a bomber, but
could easily have been adapted for other purposes.  An orbital version,
although not officially investigated, must surely have been on the minds of
the designers, Eugen Sänger and Irene Bredt.

Combat Aircraft_ and Kenneth Munson's _German War Birds_; also thanks to

Subject:  E.2.  How "stealthy" was the wooden Mosquito?

The suggestion that the Mosquito, being made largely of wood, would have
made a good "stealth bomber" is brought up every now and then.  It's a
myth.  It's true that wood absorbs some radio waves, but it also reflects
some and transmits some.  The Mosquito showed up perfectly well on radar,
mainly because the waves that passed through the wood reflected very well
off the metal internal structures -- framework, wing spars, bomb racks,
cockpit, and (especially) engines.

On modern stealth aircraft, the cockpit in particular is still a problem;
most canopy materials are almost as transparent to radio waves as they are
to visible light, and the complex shape of the interior of the cockpit (not
to mention the pilot, especially their helmet) is an excellent radar
reflector.  The materials used for canopy coatings are among the most
secret parts of stealth designs (see C.10).

It would, however, have been possible to built a stealth aircraft out of
wood, if (unlike the Mosquito) it was designed with stealth in mind from
the start.  The Germans tried it with the Horten Ho IX flying-wing fighter,
which (besides its tailless design, which helped a lot) was constructed
with special glues and coatings designed to absorb radar.  Presumably the
same would have been true of the Ho XVIII bomber.  (See E.1 for further
details.)

Subject:  E.3   Early use of aircraft in warfare

1794 Jun 2
French balloon reconnaissance against the
Austrian and Dutch during the siege of Maubeuge in Flanders.
During the fifth ascent, the Austrians fired against it
with a howitzer, one ball glancing off the basket,
after that altitude was raised to 400 m and it wasn't
fired upon effectively any more.

1849
Bombs dropped, commanded electrically via trailing 
copper wires, from unmanned ballons over Venice
during the siege.

1861-65
US civil war. Reconnaissance and artillery direction.

1870-71
Baloons carried mostly mail out of Paris 66 times
during the siege.
Prompted the design of the first dedicated anti
aircraft artillery guns, a 25 mm one made by Krupp.
Rather ineffective, as it wasn't adjustable for
range and not there were no tracer rounds.
One baloon was hit and forced to land in Preussian
controlled area, after that the flights were made
nights only.

1911-12
The first use of aeroplanes in combat was by the Italian
expeditionary corps in Libya, fighting Turkish forces.
It consisted of nine aircraft, eleven pilots and 30
ground crew.
They directed artillery, including shipborne, flew
reconnaissance flights and dropped grenades on tribes
allied with Turkey.
This was also the occasion for the first aeroplane loss
during war, when one aircraft crashed during take off,
killing the pilot.

1914 Oct 05
A French Voisin pusher shoots down a German
Aviatik with machine gun fire.

Subject:  F.1.  What good books are there on air combat?

The definitive work on air combat manoeuvring (ACM) is generally believed
to be _Fighter Combat_ by Robert L Shaw (the full title is either _Fighter
Combat:  Tactics and Manoeuvring_ or _Fighter Combat:  The Art and Science
of Air-to-Air Warfare_, depending on which edition you have).  The book is
published by the US Naval Institute, Annapolis, Maryland (ISBN
1-85260-201-5).  It covers a wide range of mission profiles, engagements
(one-on-one to many-on-many), and weapon types.
