<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">INDIANA (BB-58)
was launched by Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co.,
Newport News, Va., 21 November 1941; sponsored by Mrs. Lewis C.
Robbins, daughter of Indiana governor Henry F. Schricker; and
commissioned 30 April 1942, Captain A. A. Merrill in command. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Following
shakedown in Casco Bay, Maine, the new battleship steamed through
the Panama Canal to bolster. U.S. fleet units in the Pacific
during the critical early months of World War II. She joined Rear
Admiral Lee's carrier screening force 28 November 1942. For the
next 11 months, INDIANA helped protect carriers ENTERPRISE and
SARATOGA, then supporting American advances in the Solomons.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">INDIANA steamed to
Pearl Harbor 21 October 1943, and departed 11 November with the
support forces designated for the invasion of the Gilbert
Islands. The battleship protected the carriers which supported
the Marines during the bloody fight for Tarawa. Then late in
January 1944 she bombarded Kwajalein for 8 days prior to the
Marshall Island landings, 1 February. While maneuvering to refuel
destroyers that night, INDIANA collided with battleship
Washington. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Temporary repairs
to her starboard side were made at Majuro, and she arrived Pearl
Harbor 13 February for additional work.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">INDIANA joined
famed Task Force 58 for the Truk raid 29-30 April and bombarded
Ponape Island 1 May. In June the battlewagon proceeded to the
Marianas with a giant American fleet for the invasion of that
strategic group. She bombarded Saipan 13-14 June and brought down
several enemy aircraft while fighting off concentrated air
attacks June 15. As the Japanese fleet closed the Marianas for a
decisive naval battle, INDIANA steamed out to meet them as part
of Rear Admiral Lee's battle line. The great fleets approached
each other 19 June for the biggest carrier engagement of the war,
and as four large air raids hit the American formations, INDIANA,
aided by other ships in the screens and carrier planes, downed
hundreds of the attackers. With able assistance from submarines,
Mitscher sank two Japanese carriers in addition to inflicting
fatal losses on the enemy naval air arm during &quot;The Great
Marianas Turkey Shoot.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">INDIANA shot down
several planes, and sustained only two near torpedo misses. The
issue decided, the battleship resumed her screening duties around
the carriers, and staged at sea 64 days in daily support of the
Marianas invasion.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In August the
battleship began operations as a unit of Task Group 38.3,
bombarding the Palaus, and later the Philippines. She screened
strikes on enemy shore installations 12-30 September 1944,
helping to prepare for the coming invasion of Leyte. INDIANA
departed for Bremerton, Wash., arriving 23 October.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Reaching Pearl
Harbor 12 December, the battleship immediately began underway
training preparedness. She sailed 10 January 1945 and with a
fleet of battleships and cruisers bombarded Iwo Jima 24 January.
INDIANA then joined Task Force 58 at Ulithi and sortied 10
February for the invasion of that strategic island, next step on
the island road to Japan. She supported the carriers during a
raid on Tokyo 17 February and again on 25 February, screening
strikes on Iwo Jima in the interval. INDIANA arrived Ulithi for
replenishment 5 March 1945, having just supported a strike on the
next target Okinawa.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">INDIANA steamed
out of Ulithi 14 March for the massive Okinawa invasion, and
until June 1945 steamed In support of carrier operations against
Japan and Okinawa. These devastating strikes did much to aid the
ground campaign and lower Japanese morale at home. During this
period she often repelled enemy suicide plane attacks as the
Japanese tried desperately but vainly to stem the mounting tide
of defeat. In early June she rode out a terrible typhoon, and
sailed to San Pedro Bay, Philippines, 13 June.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As a member of
Task Group 38.1 INDIANA operated from 1 July to 15 August
supporting air strikes against Japan and bombarded coastal
targets with her big guns. The veteran battleship arrived Tokyo
Bay 5 September and 9 days later sailed for San Francisco, where
she arrived 29 September 1945. She was placed in reserve in
commission at Bremerton 11 September 1946. She decommissioned 11
September 1947, and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She was
stricken from the Navy List 1 June 1962 and sold for scrap.
INDIANA's mast is erected at the University of INDIANA at
Bloomington; her anchor rests at Fort Wayne; and other relics are
on display in various museums and schools throughout the State.</font></p>

nine battle stars for World War II service.</font></p>
