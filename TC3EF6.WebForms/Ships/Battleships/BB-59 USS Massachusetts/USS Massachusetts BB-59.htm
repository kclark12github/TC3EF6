<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MASSACHUSETTS,
(BB-59) was laid down 20 July 1939 by Bethlehem Steel Co.,
Quincy, Mass.; launched 23 September 1941; sponsored by Mrs.
Charles Francis Adams; and commissioned 12 May 1942 at Boston,
Capt. Francis E. M. Whiting in command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After shakedown,
MASSACHUSETTS departed Casco Bay, Maine. 24 October 1942 and 4
days later made rendezvous with the Western Naval Task Force for
the invasion of north Africa, serving as Flagship for Adm. H.
Kent Hewitt. While steaming off Casablanca 8 November, she came
under fire from French battleship JEAN BART's 15-inch guns. She
returned fire at 0740, firing the first 16-inch shells fired by
the U.S. against the European Axis Powers. Within a few minutes
she silenced JEAN BART's main battery; then she turned her guns
on French destroyers which had joined the attack, sinking two of
them. She also shelled shore batteries and blew up an ammunition
dump. After a cease-fire had been arranged with the French, she
headed for the United States 12 November, and prepared for
Pacific duty.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MASSACHUSETTS
arrived at Noumea, New Caledonia, 4 March 1943. For the next
months she operated in the South Pacific, protecting convoy lanes
and supporting operations in the Solomons. Between 19 November
and 21 November, she sailed with a carrier group striking Makin,
Tarawa, and Abemama in the Gilberts; on 8 December she shelled
Japanese positions on Nauru; and on 29 January 1944 she guarded
carriers striking Tarawa in the Gilberts.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The Navy now drove
steadily across the Pacific. On 30 January MASSACHUSETTS
bombarded Kwajalein, and she covered the landings there 1
February. With a carrier group she struck: against the Japanese
stronghold at Truk 17 February. That raid not only inflicted
heavy damage on Japanese aircraft and naval forces, but also
proved to be a stunning blow to enemy morale. On 21 to 22
February, MASSACHUSETTS helped fight off a heavy air attack on
her task group while it made raids on Saipan, Tinian, and Guam.
She took part in the attack on the Carolines in late March and
participated in the invasion at Hollandia 22 April which landed
60,000 troops on the island. Retiring from Hollandia, her task
force staged another attack on Truk.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MASSACHUSETTS
shelled Ponape Island 1 May, her last mission before sailing to
Puget Sound to overhaul and reline her gun barrels, now
well-worn. On 1 August she left Pearl Harbor to resume operations
in the Pacific war zone. She departed the Marshall Islands 6
October, sailing to support the landings in Leyte Gulf. In an
effort to block Japanese air attacks in the Leyte conflict, she
participated in a fleet strike against Okinawa 10 October.
Between 12 and 14 October, she protected forces hitting Formosa. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">While part of TG
38.3 she took part in the Battle for Leyte Gulf 22 to 27 October,
during which planes from her group sank four Japanese carriers
off Cape Engano.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Stopping briefly
at Ulithi, MASSACHUSETTS returned to the Philippines as part of a
task force which struck Manila 14 December while supporting the
invasion of Mindoro, MASSACHUSETTS sailed into a howling typhoon
17 December, with winds estimated at 120 knots. Three destroyers
sank at the height of the typhoons fury. Between 30 December and
23 January 1945, she sailed as part of TF 38, which struck
Formosa and supported the landing at Lingayen. During that time
she turned into the South China Sea, her task force destroying
shipping from Saigon to Hong Kong, concluding operations with air
strikes on Formosa and Okinawa.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">From 10 February
to 3 March, with the 5th Fleet, MASSACHUSETTS guarded carriers
during raids on Honshu. Her group also struck Iwo Jima by air for
the invasion of that island. On 17 March, the carriers launched
strikes against Kyushu while MASSACHUSETTS fired in repelling
enemy attacks, splashing several planes. Seven days later she
bombarded Okinawa. She spent most of April fighting off air
attacks, while engaged In the operations at Okinawa, returning to
the area in June, when she passed through the eye of a typhoon
with 100-knot winds 5 June. She bombarded Minami Daito Jima in
the Ryukyus 10 June.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MASSACHUSETTS
sailed 1 July from Leyte Gulf to join the 3d Fleet's final
offensive against Japan. After guarding carriers launching
strikes against Tokyo, she shelled Kamaishi, Honshu, 14 July,
thus hitting Japan's second largest iron and steel center. Two
weeks later she bombarded the industrial complex at Hamamatsu,
returning to blast Kamaishi 9 August. It was here that
MASSACHUSETTS fired what was probably the last 16-inch shell
fired In combat in World War II.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Victory won, the
fighting battleship sailed for Puget Sound and overhaul 1
September., She left there 28 January 1946 for operations off the
California coast, until leaving San Francisco for Hampton Roads,
arriving 22 April. She decommissioned 27 March 1947 to enter the
Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Norfolk, and was struck from the Naval
Register 1 June 1962.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Big
Mamie,&quot; as she was affectionately known, was saved from the
scrap pile when she was transferred to the MASSACHUSETTS Memorial
Committee 8 June 1965. She was enshrined at Fall River, Mass., 14
August 1965, as the Bay State's memorial to those who gave their
lives in World War II.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MASSACHUSETTS
received 11 battle stars for World War II service. </font></p>
