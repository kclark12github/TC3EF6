<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW MEXICO (BB-40)
was laid down 14 October 1915 by the New York Navy Yard; launched
13 April 1917; sponsored by Miss Margaret C. DeBaca, daughter of
the Governor of New Mexico; and commissioned 20 May 1918, Capt.
Ashley H. Robertson in command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After initial
training, NEW MEXICO departed New York 15 January 1919 for Brest,
France, to escort home transport GEORGE WASHINGTON carrying
President Woodrow Wilson from the Versailles Peace Conference,
returning to Hampton Roads 27 February. There on 16 July she
became flagship of the newly-organized Pacific Fleet, and three
days later sailed for the Panama Canal and San Pedro, Calif.,
arriving 9 August. The next 12 years were marked by frequent
combined maneuvers with the Atlantic fleet both in the Pacific
and Caribbean which included visits to South American ports and a
1925 cruise to Australia and New Zealand.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Modernized and
overhauled at Philadelphia between March 1931 and January 1933,
NEW MEXICO returned to the Pacific in October 1934 to resume
training exercises and tactical development operations. As war
threatened, her base was Pearl Harbor from 6 December 1940 until
20 May 1941, Then she sailed to join the Atlantic fleet at
Norfolk 16 June for duty on neutrality patrol. When the Japanese
attacked Pearl Harbor, she returned to the west coast, and sailed
1 August 1942 from San Francisco to prepare in Hawaii for action.
Between 6 December and 22 March 1943, she sailed escort troop
transports to the Fijis, then patrolled the southwest Pacific,
returning to Pearl Harbor to prepare for the campaign against the
Japanese in the Aleutians. On 17 May she arrived Adak, her base
while serving on the blockade of Attu, and on 21 July she joined
in the massive bombardment of Kiska that forced its evacuation a
week later.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After refitting at
Puget Sound Navy Yard, NEW MEXICO returned to Pearl Harbor 25
October to rehearse the assault on the Gilbert Islands. During
the invasion, begun 20 November, she pounded Butaritari, guarded
transports during their night withdrawals from the islands, and
provided anticraft cover during unloading operations, as well as
screening carriers. She returned to Pearl Harbor 5 December.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Underway with the
Marshall Islands assault force 12 January 1944, NEW MEXICO
bombarded Kwajalein and Ebeye 31 January and 1 February, then
replenished at Majuro. She blasted Wotje 20 February and Kavieng,
New Ireland 20 March, then visited Sydney before arriving in the
Solomons in May to rehearse the Marianas operation.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW MEXICO
bombarded Tinian 14 June, Saipan 15 June, and Guam 16 June, and
twice helped drive off enemy air attacks 18 June. She protected
transports off the Marianas while the carrier task force spelled
the doom of Japanese naval aviation in its great victory, the
Battle of the Philippine Sea, 19-20 June. NEW MEXICO escorted
transports to Eniwetok, then sailed 9 July guarding escort
carriers until 12 July, when her guns opened on Guam in
preparation for the landings 21 July. Until 30 July she blasted
enemy positions and installations on the island.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Overhauled at
Bremerton August to October, NEW MEXICO arrived in Leyte Gulf 22
November to cover the movement of reinforcement and supply
convoys, firing in the almost daily air attacks over the Gulf, as
the Japanese posed desperate resistance to the reconquest of the
Philippines. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">She left Leyte
Gulf 2 December for the Palaus, where she joined a force covering
the Mindorobound assault convoy. Again she sent up antiaircraft
fire as invasion troops stormed ashore 15 December, providing
cover for two days until sailing for the Palaus.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Her next operation
was the invasion of Luzon, fought under a sky full of would-be
suicide planes, against whom she was almost continually; at
general quarters. She fired prelanding bombardment 6 January
1945, and that day took a suicide hit on her bridge which killed
her commanding officer, Captain R. W. Fleming, and 29 others of
her crew, with 87 injured. Her guns remained in action as she
repaired damage, and she was still in action January as troops
went ashore.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After repairs at
Pearl Harbor, NEW MEXICO arrived at Ulithi to stage for the
invasion of Okinawa, sailing 21 March with a heavy fire support
group. Her guns opened on Okinawa 26 March, and were not silent
until 17 April as she gave every aid to troops engaged ashore.
Again on 21 and 29 April she opened fire, and on 11 May she
destroyed 8 suicide boats. While approaching her berth in Hagushi
anchorage just after sunset 12 May, NEW MEXICO was attacked by
two suicides; one plunged into her, the other managed to hit her
with his bomb. She was set an fire, and 54 of her men were
killed, with 119 wounded. Swift action extinguished the fires
within half an hour, and on 28 May she departed for repairs at
Leyte, followed by rehearsals for the planned invasion of the
Japanese home islands. Word of the war's end reached her at
Saipan 15 August, and next day she sailed for Okinawa to join the
occupation force. She entered Sagami Wan 27 August to support the
airborne occupation of Atsugi Airfield, then next day passed into
Tokyo Bay to witness the surrender 2 September.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW MEXICO was
homeward bound 6 September, calling at Okinawa, Pearl Harbor, and
the Panama Canal before arriving Boston 17 October. There she
decommissioned 19 July 1946. She was sold for scrapping 13
October 1947 to Lipsett, Inc., New York City.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW MEXICO
received 6 battle stars for World War II service. </font></p>
