<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The second SOUTH
DAKOTA (BB-57) was laid down on 5 July 1939 at Camden, N.J., by
the New York Shipbuilding Corp.; launched on 7 June 1941;
sponsored by Mrs. Harlan J. Bushfield; and commissioned on 20
March 1942, Capt. Thomas L. Gatch in command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After fitting out
at Philadelphia, SOUTH DAKOTA held shakedown training from 3 June
to 26 July. She stood out of Philadelphia Navy Yard on 16 August
and headed for Panama. The battleship transited the Panama Canal
on 21 August and set course for the Tonga Islands, arriving at
Nukualofa, Tongatabu, on 4 September. Two days later, she struck
an uncharted corral pinnacle in Lahai Passage and suffered
extensive damage to her hull. On 12 September, the ship sailed
for the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard and repairs.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">SOUTH DAKOTA was
ready for sea again on 12 October and began training with Task
Force (TF) 16 which was built around aircraft carrier ENTERPRISE
(CV-6). The task force sortied from Pearl Harbor on 16 October to
join TF 17, which was centered on carrier HORNET (CV-8),
northeast of Espiritu Santo. The rendezvous was made on the 24th;
and the combined force, now operating as TF 61 under Rear Admiral
T. C. Kinkaid, was ordered to make a sweep of the Santa Cruz
Islands and then move southwest to block any Japanese forces
approaching Guadalcanal.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Catalina&quot;
patrol bombers sighted a Japanese carrier force at noon on the
25th, and TF 61 steamed northwest to intercept It. Early the next
morning, when all carrier forces were within striking range, a
Japanese snooper spotted the American force, triggering the
Battle of Santa Cruz. SOUTH DAKOTA and the ENTERPRISE group were
approximately 10 miles from the HORNET group when the air battle
began.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The first enemy
attack was concentrated against HORNET. At 1045, SOUTH DAKOTA was
operating near ENTERPRISE to provide protective fire from her
numerous antiaircraft guns when their group was attacked by dive
bombers. Approximately an hour later, about 40 torpedo planes
struck at the two ships. A third aerial assault, made by dive
bombers and torpedo planes; came in at 1230. SOUTH DAKOTA
sustained a 500-pound bomb hit on top of her number one turret.
When the action was broken off that evening, the American forces
retired toward Noumea, New Caledonia, with the battleship
credited with downing 26 enemy planes.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At 0414 on 30
October, while avoiding a submarine contact, SOUTH DAKOTA and
MAHAN (DD-364) collided, causing damage to both ships. MAHAN's
bow was turned to port and crumpled to frame 14, and a fire, soon
brought under control, started in her forward hold. Both ships
continued to Noumea where VESTAL (AR-4) repaired SOUTH DAKOTA's
collision and battle damage.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 11 November,
SOUTH DAKOTA, as part of TF 16, sortied from Noumea for
Guadalcanal. On 13 November, she joined battleship WASHINGTON
(BB-56) and destroyers PRESTON (DD-379), WALKE (DD418), BENHAM
(DD-397), and GWIN (DD-433) to form TF 64 under command of Rear
Admiral W. A. Lee. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The next evening
at 2330, the force was operating 50 miles southwest of
Guadalcanal when Lee learned that an enemy convoy was coming
through the passage off Savo sometime between 0030 and 0230. This
was Admiral Kondo's bombardment group consisting of battleship
KIRISHIMA; heavy cruisers TAKAO and ATAGO; and a destroyer
screen.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Admiral Kondo's
forces were divided into three sections: the bombardment group; a
close screen of cruiser NAGARA and six destroyers; and a distant
screen of cruiser SENDAI and three destroyers in the van of the
other forces. A quarter moon assured good visibility. Three ships
were visually sighted from the bridge of SOUTH DAKOTA, range
18,100 yards. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON fired
on the leading ship, thought to be a battleship or heavy cruiser;
and, a minute later, SOUTH DAKOTA's main battery opened on the
ship nearest to her. Both initial salvos started fires on the
targets. SOUTH DAKOTA then fired on another target and continued
firing until it disappeared from her radar screen. Turret No.
3-firing over her stern and demolishing her own planes in the
process-opened on another target and continued firing until the
target was thought to sink. Her secondary batteries were firing
at eight destroyers close to the shore of Savo Island.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">A short lull
followed after which radar plot showed four enemy ships, just
clear of the left tangent of Savo, approaching from the starboard
bow; range 5,800 yards. Searchlights from the second ship in the
enemy column illuminated SOUTH DAKOTA. WASHINGTON opened with her
main battery on the leading, and largest, Japanese ship. SOUTH
DAKOTA's secondary batteries put out the lights; and she shifted
all batteries to bear on the third ship, believed to be a
cruiser, which soon gushed smoke. SOUTH DAKOTA, which had been
under fire from at least three of the ships, had taken 42 hits
which caused considerable damage. Her radio communications
failed; radar plot was demolished; three fire control radars were
damaged; there was a fire in her foremast; and she had lost track
of WASHINGTON. As she was no longer receiving enemy fire and
there were no remaining targets, she withdrew; met WASHINGTON at
a prearranged rendezvous; and proceeded to Noumea. Of the
American destroyers, only GWIN returned to port. The other three
had been severely damaged early in the engagement. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WALKE and PRESTON
were sunk. BENHAM had part of her bow blown off by a torpedo and,
while en route to Noumea with the damaged GWIN as her escort, had
to be abandoned. GWIN then sank her by gunfire. On the enemy
side, hits had been scored on TAKAO and ATAGO; KIRISHIMA and
destroyer AYANAMI, severely damaged by gunfire, were abandoned
and scuttled.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">PROMETHEUS (AR-3)
repaired some of the damage inflicted on SOUTH DAKOTA at Noumea,
enabling the battleship to sail on the 25th for Tongatabu and
thence for home. SOUTH DAKOTA arrived at New York on 18 December
1942 for an overhaul and the completion of repairs to her battle
damage. She was back at sea on 25 February 1943 and, following
sea trials, operated with RANGER (CV-4) in the North Atlantic
until mid-April.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleship
next operated with the British Home Fleet, based at Scapa Flow,
until 1 August when she returned to Norfolk. On 21 August, SOUTH
DAKOTA stood out of Norfolk en route to Efate Island, arriving at
Havannah Harbor on 14 September. She moved to Fiji on 7 November
and sortied from there four days later with Battleship Divisions
(BatDiv) 8 and 9 in support of Task Group (TG) 50.1, the Carrier
Interceptor Group. for Operation &quot;Galvanic,&quot; the
Gilbert Islands assault. The carriers launched attacks against
Jaluit and Mili atolls, Marshall Islands, on 19 November, to
neutralize enemy airfields there. The force then provided air
support for the amphibious landings on Makin and Tarawa, Gilbert
Islands.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">SOUTH DAKOTA, with
five other battleships, formed another task group on 8 December
to bombard Nauru Island. A joint aerial attack and shore
bombardment severely damaged enemy shore installations and
airfields there. SOUTH DAKOTA retired to Efate on 12 December
1943 for upkeep and rearming. Her next action occurred on 29
January 1944 when the carriers launched attacks against Roi and
Namur, Marshall Islands. The next day, the battleship moved in to
shell enemy positions on Roi and Namur and then rejoined the
carriers as they provided air support for the amphibious landings
on Kwajalein, Majuro, Roi, and Namur.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">SOUTH DAKOTA
departed the Marshall Islands on 12 February with the Truk
striking force which launched attacks against that Japanese
stronghold on 17 and 18 February. Six days later, she was in the
screen for the carriers which launched the first air attacks
against the Marianas. The force was under constant enemy air
attack, and SOUTH DAKOTA splashed four Japanese planes. She
returned to Majuro from 26 February until 22 March when she
sailed with the fast carrier forces of the of the 5th Fleet. Air
strikes were delivered from 30 March until 1 April against Palau,
Yap, Woleai, and Ulithi in the Western Caroline Islands.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">SOUTH DAKOTA
returned to Majuro on 6 April and sailed the following week,
again accompanying the fast carriers. On 21 April, strikes were
launched against Hollandia, New Guinea, and the following day
against Aitape, Tanahmerah, and Humboldt Bays to support the Army
landings. On 29 and 30 April, the carriers, with SOUTH DAKOTA
still in the screen, returned to Truk and bombed that base. The
next day, the battleship was part of a surface bombardment group
that shelled Ponape Island in the Carolines. She returned to
Majuro for upkeep from 4 May to 5 June when she got underway with
TF 58 to participate in Operation &quot;Forager,&quot; the
landings on Saipan and Tinian. The carriers began launching
attacks on the 11th against enemy installations throughout the
islands. On the 13th, SOUTH DAKOTA and six other battleships were
detached from the fast carrier groups to bombard Saipan and
Tinian, SOUTH DAKOTA shelled the northwest coast of Tanapag
Harbor, Saipan, for over six hours with both her primary and
secondary batteries.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On the evening of
the 15th, 8 to 12 enemy fighters and bombers broke through the
combat air patrol and attacked the task group. SOUTH DAKOTA fired
at four and splashed one; and the remaining 11 were shot down by
fire from other ships. On 19 June, the battleship was again
operating with the fast carriers. It was known that a major
Japanese force was approaching from the west, and the American
capital ships were placed so that they could continue to support
the ground forces on Saipan and also intercept this enemy force.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At 1012, a large
group of bogies was reported coming in from the west. At 1049, a
&quot;Judy&quot; dropped a 500-pound bomb on SOUTH DAKOTA's main
deck where it blew a large hole, cut wiring and piping, but
inflicted no other serious material damage. However, personnel
losses were heavy: 24 killed and 27 wounded. The ship continued
to fight throughout the day as air attacks were continuous. This
was the first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea and was
called the &quot;Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot; as the Japanese lost
over 300 aircraft. The air battle continued throughout the 20th.
When it ended, the badly mauled Japanese fleet no longer posed a
threat to the American conquest of the Marianas. The task group
returned to Ulithi on 27 June, and SOUTH DAKOTA sailed via Pearl
Harbor to the west coast, arriving at Puget Sound on 10 July.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleship was
overhauled at the navy yard there; and, after sea trials, sailed
on 26 August for Pearl Harbor. SOUTH DAKOTA was routed to Ulithi
and, upon her arrival, was attached to TG 38.3; one of four task
groups of formed Task Force 38, the Fast Carrier Task Force. The
task force sortied on 6 October and, four days later, launched
air attacks against Okinawa. On the 12th and 13th, attacks were
flown against shipping and installations in Formosa. Three of the
groups, including SOUTH DAKOTA's, retired and operated east of
the Philippine Islands until 24 December. During the operation,
carriers of the group flew strikes against targets on Manila and
Luzon to support the landings on Mindoro. From 30 December 1944
through 26 January 1945, the fast carriers alternated strikes
between Formosa on 3, 4, 9, 15, and 21 January; Luzon on the 6th
and 7th; Cape San Jacques and Camranh Bay on the 12th; Hong Kong
and Hainan on the 16th; and against Okinawa on 22 January.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">SOUTH DAKOTA
operated with the fast carriers in their strikes against the
Tokyo area on 17 February and against Iwo Jima on the 19th and
20th in support of amphibious landings there. Tokyo again was the
target on the 25th, and Okinawa's turn came on 1 March. After
rearming at Ulithi, the task groups sailed toward Japan again and
pounded targets in the Kobe, Kure, and Kyushu areas on 18 and 19
March. They launched strikes against Okinawa on the 23d; and, on
the 24th, the battleship joined a bombardment group which shelled
southeastern Okinawa. She rejoined her task group which, after
bombing Okinawa, struck enemy airfields in southern Kyushu on the
29th and then, from 31 March through 3 April, again pounded
targets on Okinawa. On 7 April, all fast carriers launched
attacks against an enemy fleet off southwest Kyushu, sinking
Japan's fast super battleship YAMATO, two cruisers, and four
destroyers.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">SOUTH DAKOTA once
more participated in shore bombardment on southeastern Okinawa on
19 April in support of an all-out offensive by the XXIV Army
Corps against enemy lines.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">While rearming
from WRANGELL (AE-12) on 6 May, a tank of 16-inch high capacity
powder exploded, causing a fire and exploding four more tanks.
Turret No. 2 magazines were flooded and the fires put out. The
ship lost three men killed instantly; eight more died of
injuries; and 24 others suffered non-fatal wounds. The ship
retired to Guam from 11 to 29 May when she sailed for Leyte,
arriving on 1 June.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">SOUTH DAKOTA
departed Leyte on 1 July, supporting the carriers of TG 38.1
which attacked the Tokyo area on the 10th. On 14 July, as part of
a bombardment group, she participated in the shelling of the
Kamaishi Steel Works, Kamaishi, Honshu, Japan. This was the first
gunfire attack on the Japanese home islands by heavy warships.
From 15 through 28 March, SOUTH DAKOTA again supported the
carriers as they launched strikes against Honshu and Hokkaido. On
the night of 29 and 30 July, she participated in the shore
bombardment of Hamamatsu, Honshu, and, on the 9th, again shelled
Kamaishi. The battleship supported the carriers in strikes
against northern Honshu on 10 August, and in the Tokyo area on
the 18th and 15th. The latter was the last strike of the war for,
later that day, Japan capitulated.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">She anchored in
Sagami Wan, Honshu, on 27 August and entered Tokyo Bay on the
29th. SOUTH DAKOTA steamed out of Tokyo Bay on 20 September and
proceeded, via Okinawa and Pearl Harbor, to the west coast of the
United States. On 29 October, she moved down the coast from San
Francisco to San Pedro. She sailed from the west coast on 8
January 1946 for Philadelphia and a yard overhaul. In June, she
was attached to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. On 31 January 1947,
she was placed in reserve, out of commission. The battleship
remained in that status until she was struck from the Navy list
on 1 June 1962. On 25 October 1962, she was sold to Lipsett
Division, Luria Bros. and Co., Inc., for scrap.</font></p>
