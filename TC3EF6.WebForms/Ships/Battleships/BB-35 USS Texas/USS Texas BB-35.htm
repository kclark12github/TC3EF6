<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The second TEXAS
(Battleship No. 35) was laid down on 17 April 1911 at Newport
News, Va., by the Newport News Shipbuilding Co.; launched on 18
May 1912; sponsored by Miss Claudia Lyon; and commissioned on 12
March 1914, Capt. Albert W. Grant in command. On 24 March, TEXAS
departed the Norfolk Navy Yard and set a course for New York. She
made an overnight stop at Tompkinsville, N.Y., on the night of
the 26th and 27th and entered the New York Navy Yard on the
latter day. She spent the next three weeks there undergoing the
installation of the fire control equipment. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">During her stay in
New York, President Woodrow Wilson ordered a number of ships of
the Atlantic Fleet to Mexican waters in response to tension
created when an overzealous detail of Mexican Federal troops
detained an American boat crew at Tampico. The problem was
quickly resolved locally, but fiery Rear Admiral Henry T. Mayo
sought further redress by demanding an official disavowal of the
act by the Huerta regime and a 21gun salute to the American flag.
</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately for
Mexican-American relations, President Wilson apparently saw in
the incident an opportunity to put pressure on a government he
felt was undemocratic. On 20 April, Wilson placed the matter
before the Congress and sent orders to Rear Admiral Frank Friday
Fletcher, commanding the naval force off the Mexican coast,
instructing him to land a force at Veracruz and to seize the
customs house there in retaliation for the celebrated
&quot;Tampico Incident.&quot; That action was carried out on the
21st and 22d. Due to the intensity of the situation, when TEXAS
put to sea on 13 May she headed directly to operational duty
without benefit of the usual shakedown cruise and post-shakedown
repair period. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After a five-day
stop at Hampton Roads between 14 and 19 May, she joined Rear
Admiral Fletcher's force off Veracruz on the 26th. She remained
in Mexican waters for just over two months, supporting the
American forces ashore. On 8 August, she left Veracruz and set a
course for Nipe Bay, Cuba, and thence steamed to New York where
she entered the Navy Yard on 21 August. The battleship remained
there until 6 September when she returned to sea, joined the
Atlantic Fleet, and settled into a schedule of normal fleet
operations. In October, she returned to the Mexican coast. Later
that month, TEXAS became station ship at Tuxpan, a duty that
lasted until early November. The ship finally bade Mexico
farewell at Tampico on 20 December and set a course for New York.
The battleship entered the New York Navy Yard on 28 December and
remained there undergoing repairs until 16 February 1916. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Upon her return to
active duty with the fleet, TEXAS resumed a schedule of training
operations along the New England coast and off the Virginia Capes
alternated with winter fleet tactical and gunnery drills in the
West Indies. That routine lasted just over two bears until the
February-to-March crisis over unrestricted submarine warfare
catapulted the United States into war with the Central Powers in
April 1917. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The 6 April
declaration of war found TEXAS riding at anchor in the mouth of
the York River with the other Atlantic Fleet battleships. She
remained in the Virginia Capes-Hampton Roads vicinity until
mid-August conducting exercises and training naval armed-guard
gun crews for service on board merchant ships. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In August, she
steamed to New York for repairs, arriving at Base 10 on the 19th
and entering the New York Navy Yard soon thereafter. She
completed repairs on 26 September and got underway for Port
Jefferson that same day. During the mid-watch on the 27th,
however, she ran hard aground on Block Island. For three days,
her crew lightened ship to no avail. On the 30th, tugs came to
her assistance, and she finally backed clear. Hull damaged
dictated a return to the yard, and the extensive repairs she
required precluded her departure with Division 9 for the British
Isles in November. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">By December, she
had completed repairs and moved south to conduct war games out of
the York River. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Mid-January 1918
found the battleship back at New York preparing for the voyage
across the Atlantic. She departed New York on 30 January; arrived
at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands off the coast of Scotland on
11 February; and rejoined Division 9, by then known as the 6th
Battle Squadron of Britain's Grand Fleet. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TEXAS' service
with the Grand Fleet consisted entirely of convoy missions and
occasional forays to reinforce the British squadron on blockade
duty in the North Sea whenever German heavy units threatened. The
fleet alternated between bases at Scapa Flow and at the Firth of
Forth in Scotland. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TEXAS began her
mission only five days after her arrival at Scapa Flow where she
sortied with the entire fleet to reinforce the 4th Battle
Squadron, then on duty in the North Sea. She returned to Scapa
Flow the next day and remained until 8 March when she put to sea
on a convoy escort mission from which she returned on the 13th. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TEXAS and her
division mates entered the Firth of Forth on 12 April but got
underway again on the 17th to escort a convoy. The American
battleships returned to base on 20 April. Four days later, TEXAS
again stood out to sea to support the 2d Battle Squadron the day
after the German High Seas Fleet had sortied from Jade Bay toward
the Norwegian coast to threaten an Allied convoy. Forward units
caught sight of the retiring Germans on the 25th but at such
extreme range that no possibility of bringing the enemy to battle
existed. The Germans returned to their base that day, and the
Grand Fleet; including TEXAS, did likewise on the next. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TEXAS and her
division mates passed a relatively quiescent May in the Firth of
Forth. On 9 June, she got underway with the other warships of the
6th Battle Squadron and headed back to the anchorage at Scapa
Flow, arriving there the following day. Between 30 June and 2
July, TEXAS and her colleagues acted as escort for American
minelayers adding to the North Sea mine barrage. After a two-day
return to Scapa Flow, TEXAS put to sea with the Grand Fleet to
conduct two days of tactical exercises and war games. At the
conclusion of those drills on 8 July, the fleet entered the Firth
of Forth. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">For the remainder
of World War I, TEXAS and the other battleships of Division 9
continued to operate with the Grand Fleet as the 6th Battle
Squadron. With the German Fleet increasingly more tied to its
bases in the estuaries of the Jade and Ema Rivers, the American
and British ships settled, more and more into a routine schedule
of operations with little or no hint of combat operations. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">That state of
affairs lasted until the armistice ended hostilities on 11
November 1918. On the night of 20 and 21 November, she
accompanied the Grand Fleet to meet the surrendering German
Fleet. The two fleets rendezvoused about 40 miles east of May
Island located near the mouth of the Firth of Forth-and proceeded
together into the anchorage at Scapa Flow. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Afterward, the
American contingent moved to Portland, England, arriving there on
4 December. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Eight days later,
TEXAS put to sea with Divisions 9 and 6 to meet President Woodrow
Wilson embarked in GEORGE WASHINGTON on his way to the Paris
Peace Conference. The rendezvous took place at about 0730 the
following morning and provided an escort for the President into
Brest, France, where the ships arrived at 1230 that afternoon.
That evening, TEXAS and the other American battleships departed
Brest for Portland where they stopped briefly on the 14th before
getting underway to return to the United States. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The warships
arrived off Ambrose Light on Christmas Day 1918 and entered New
York on the 26th. Following overhaul, TEXAS resumed duty with the
Atlantic Fleet early in 1919. On 9 March, she became the first
American battleship to carry an airplane when Lt. Comdr. Edward
O. McDonnell flew a British-built Sopwith &quot;Camel&quot; off
the warship. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">That summer, she
was reassigned to the Pacific Fleet. On 17 July 1920, she was
designated BB-35 as a result of the Navy's adoption of the
alpha-numeric system of hull designations. TEXAS served in the
Pacific until 1924 when she returned to the east coast for
overhaul and to participate in a training cruise to European
waters with Naval Academy midshipmen embarked. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">That fall, she
conducted maneuvers as a unit of the Scouting Fleet. In 1925, she
entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for a major modernization overhaul
during which her cage masts were replaced with a single tripod
foremast. She also received the very latest in fire control
equipment. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Following that
overhaul, she resumed duty along the eastern seaboard and kept at
that task until late in 1927 when she did a brief tour of duty in
the Pacific between late September and early December. Near the
end of the year, TEXAS returned to the Atlantic and resumed
normal duty with the Scouting Fleet. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In January 1928,
she transported President Herbert Hoover to Havana for the
PanAmerican conference and then continued on via the Panama Canal
and the west coast to maneuvers with the fleet near Hawaii. She
returned to New York early in 1929 for her annual overhaul and
had completed it by March when she began another brief tour of
duty in the Pacific. She returned to the Atlantic in June and
resumed normal duty with the Scouting Fleet. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In April 1930, she
took time from her operating schedule to escort SS LEVIATHAN into
New York when that ship returned from Europe carrying the
delegation that had represented the United States at the London
Naval Conference. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In January 1931,
she left the yard at New York as flagship of the United States
Fleet and headed via the Panama Canal to San Diego, her home port
for the next six years. During that period, she served first as
flagship for the entire Fleet and, later, as flagship for
Battleship Division (BatDiv) 1. She left the Pacific once during
that time, in the summer of 1936, when she joined in a midshipman
training cruise in the Atlantic. Upon completion of that
assignment, the battleship immediately rejoined Battle Force in
the Pacific. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In the summer of
1937, she once more was reassigned to the east coast, as the
flagship of the Training Detachment, United States Fleet. Late in
1938 or early in 1939, the warship became flagship of the newly
organized Atlantic Squadron, built around BatDiv 5. Through both
organizational assignments, her labors were directed primarily to
training missions, midshipman cruises, naval reserve drills, and
training members of the Fleet Marine Force. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Soon after war
broke out in Europe in September 1939, TEXAS began operating on
the &quot;neutrality patrol,&quot; established to keep the war
out of the western hemisphere. Later, as the United States moved
toward more active support of the Allied cause, the warship began
convoying ships carrying Lend-Lease material to Great Britain. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Sunday, 7 December
1941, found the battleship at Casco Bay, Maine, undergoing a rest
and relaxation period following three months of watch duty at
Argentia, Newfoundland. After 10 days of Casco Bay; she returned
to Argentia and remained there until late January 1942 when she
got underway to escort a convoy to England. After delivering her
charges, the battleship patrolled waters near Iceland until March
when she returned home. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">For the next six
months, she continued convoy escort missions. Her destinations
were various. On one occasion, she escorted Guadalcanal-bound
marines as far as Panama. On another, the warship screened
service troops to Freetown, Sierra Leone, on the west coast of
Africa. More frequently, she made voyages to and from Great
Britain escorting both cargo- and troop-carrying ships. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 23 October,
TEXAS embarked upon her first major combat operation when she
sortied with Task Group (TG) 34.8, the Northern Attack Group for
Operation &quot;Torch,&quot; the invasion of North Africa. The
objective assigned to this group was Mehedia near Port Lyautey
and the port itself. The ships arrived off the assault beaches
early in the morning of 8 November and began preparations for the
invasion. When the troops went ashore, TEXAS did not come
immediately into action to support them. At that point in the
war, amphibious warfare doctrine was still embryonic; and many
did not recognize the value of a prelanding bombardment. Instead,
the Army insisted upon attempting surprise. TEXAS finally entered
the fray early in the afternoon when the Army requested her to
destroy an ammunition dump near Port Lyautey. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">For the next week,
she contented herself with cruising up and down the Moroccan
coast delivering similar, specific, call-fire missions. Thus,
unlike in later operations, she expended only 273 rounds of
14-inch and 6 rounds of 6-inch. During her short stay, some of
her crew briefly went ashore to assist in salvaging some of the
shipping sunk in the harbor. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 16 November,
she departed North Africa and headed for home in company with
SAVANNAH (CL-42), SANGAMON (ACV-26), KENNEBEC (AO86), four
transports, and seven destroyers. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Throughout 1943
TEXAS carried out the familiar role of convoy escort. With New
York as her home port, she made numerous transatlantic voyages to
such places as Casablanca and Gibraltar, as well as frequent
visits to ports in the British Isles. That routine continued into
1944 but ended in April of that gear when, at the European end of
one such mission, she remained at the Clyde estuary in Scotland
and began training for the invasion of Normandy. That warm-up
period lasted about seven weeks at the end of which she departed
the Clyde and traveled down the Irish Sea and around the southern
coast of England to arrive off the Normandy beaches on the night
of 5 and 6 June. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At about 0440 on
the morning of the 6th, the battleship closed the Normandy coast
to a point some 12,000 yards offshore near Pointe du Hoc. At
0650, TEXAS began churning up the coastal landscape with her
14-inch salvoes. Meanwhile, her secondary battery went to work on
another target on the western end of &quot;Omaha&quot; beach, a
ravine laced with strong points to defend an exit road. Later,
under control of airborne spotters, she moved her major-caliber
fire inland to interdict enemy reinforcement activities and to
destroy batteries and other strong points farther inland. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">By noon, she
closed the beach to about a range of 3,000 yards to fire upon
snipers and machinegun nests hidden in a defile just off the
beach. At the conclusion of that mission, the warship took an
enemy antiaircraft battery located west of Vierville under fire. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The following
morning, her main battery rained 14-inch shells on the enemy-held
towns of Surrain and Trevieres to break up German troop
concentrations. That evening, she bombarded a German mortar
battery which had been shelling the beach. Not long after
midnight, German planes attacked the ships offshore, and one of
them swooped in low on TEXAS' starboard quarter. Her antiaircraft
batteries opened up immediately but failed to score on the
intruder. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On the morning of
8 June, her guns fired on Isigny, then on a shore battery, and
finally on Trevieres once more. After that, she retired to
Plymouth to rearm, returning to the French coast on the 11th.
From then until the 15th, she supported the Army in its advance
inland, However, by the latter day, the troops had advanced
beyond the range of her guns; and the battleship moved on to
another mission. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On the morning of
26 June, TEXAS closed in on the vital port of Cherbourg and, with
ARKANSAS (BB-33), opened fire upon various fortifications and
batteries surrounding the town. The guns on shore returned fire
immediately and, at about 1230, succeeded in straddling TEXAS.
The battleship, however, continued her firing runs in spite of
shell geysers blossoming about her. The enemy gunners were
stubborn and good. At 1316 a 280-millimeter shell slammed into
her fire control tower, killed the helmsman, and wounded nearly
everyone on the navigation bridge. TEXAS' commanding officer,
Capt. Baker, miraculously escaped unhurt and quickly had the
bridge cleared, The warship herself continued to deliver her 14-
inch shells in spite of damage and casualties. Some time later,
another shell struck the battleship. That one, a 240-millimeter
armor-piercing shell, crashed through the port bow, entered a
compartment located below the wardroom, but failed to explode.
Throughout the three-hour duel, the Germans straddled and
near-missed TEXAS over 65 times, but she continued her mission
until 1600 when, upon orders to that effect, she retired. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TEXAS underwent
repairs at Plymouth, England, and then drilled in preparation for
the invasion of southern France. On 16 July , she departed
Belfast Lough and headed for the Mediterranean. After stops at
Gibraltar and Oran in Algeria, the battleship rendezvoused with
three French destroyers off Bizerte, Tunisia, and set a course
for the Riviera coast of France. She arrived off St. Tropez
during the night of 14 and 15 July. At 0444, she moved into
position for the prelanding bombardment and, at 0651, opened up
on her first target, a battery of five 155millimeter guns. Due to
the fact that the troops ashore moved inland rapidly against
light resistance, she provided fire support for the assault for
only two days. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TEXAS departed the
southern coast of France on the evening of 16 August. After a
stop at Palermo, Sicily, she left the Mediterranean and headed
for New York where she arrived on 14 September 1944. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At New York, TEXAS
underwent a 36-day repair period during which the barrels on her
main battery were replaced. After a brief refresher cruise, she
departed New York in November and set a course, via the Panama
Canal, for the Pacific. She made a stop at Long Beach, Calif.,
and then continued on to Oahu. She spent Christmas at Pearl
Harbor and then conducted maneuvers in the Hawaiian Islands for
about a month at the end of which she steamed to Ulithi Atoll.
She departed Ulithi on 10 February 1945, stopped in the Marianas
for two days' invasion rehearsals, and then set a course for Iwo
Jima. She arrived off the target on 16 February, three days
before the scheduled assault. She spent those three days pounding
enemy defenses on Iwo Jima in preparation for the landings. After
the troops stormed ashore on the 19th, TEXAS switched roles and
began delivering support and call fire. She remained off Iwo Jima
for almost a fortnight, helping the marines subdue a well dug-in
and stubborn Japanese garrison. Though Iwo Jima was not declared
secured until 16 March, TEXAS cleared the area late in February
and returned to Ulithi early in March to prepare for the Okinawa
operation. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">She departed
Ulithi with TF 54, the gunfire support unit, on 21 March and
arrived in the Ryukyus on the 26th. TEXAS did not participate in
the occupation of the islands and roadstead at Kerama Retto
carried out on the 26th but moved in on the main objective
instead, beginning the prelanding bombardment that same day. For
the next six days, she delivered 14-inch salvoes to prepare the
way for the Army and the Marine Corps. Each evening, she retired
from her bombardment position close to the Okinawan shore only to
return the next day and resume her poundings. The enemy ashore,
preparing for a defense-in-depth strategy as at Iwo Jima, made no
answer. Only his air units provided a response, sending several
kamikaze raids to harass the bombardment group. TEXAS escaped
damage during those small attacks. After six days of aerial and
naval bombardment, the ground troops' turn came on 1 April. They
stormed ashore against initially light resistance. For almost two
months, TEXAS remained in Okinawan waters providing gunfire
support for the troops ashore and fending off the enemy aerial
assault. In performing the latter mission, she claimed one
kamikaze kill on her own and three assists. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Late in May, TEXAS
retired to Leyte in the Philippines and remained there until
after the Japanese capitulation on 15 August. She returned to
Okinawa toward the end of August and stayed in the Ryukyus until
23 September. On that day, she set a course for the United States
with troops embarked. The battleship delivered her passengers to
San Pedro, Calif., on 15 October. she celebrated Navy Day there
on 27 October and then resumed her mission bringing American
troops home. She made two round-trip voyages between California
and Oahu in November and a third in late December. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 21 January
1946, the warship departed San Pedro and steamed via the Panama
Canal to Norfolk where she arrived on 13 February. She soon began
preparations for inactivation. In June, she was moved to
Baltimore, Md., where she remained until the beginning of 1948. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TEXAS was towed to
San Jacinto State Park in TEXAS where she was decommissioned on
21 April 1948 and turned over to the state of Texas to serve as a
permanent memorial. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 30
April 1948. </font></p>

earned five battle stars during World War II. </font></p>
