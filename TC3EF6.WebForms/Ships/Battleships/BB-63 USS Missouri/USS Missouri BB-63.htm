<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The fourth
MISSOURI (BB-B3), the last battleship completed by the United
States, was laid down 6 January 1941 by New York Naval Shipyard;
launched 29 January 1944; sponsored by Miss Margaret Truman,
daughter of then Senator from Missouri Harry S Truman, later
President; and commissioned 11 June 1944, Capt. William M.
Callaghan in command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After trials off
New York and shakedown and battle practice in Chesapeake Bay,
MISSOURI departed Norfolk 11 November 1944, transited the Panama
Canal 18 November and steamed to San Francisco for final fitting
out as fleet flagship. She stood out of San Francisco Bay 14
December and arrived Ulithi, West Caroline Islands, 13 January
1945. There she was temporary headquarters ship for Vice Adm.
Marc A, Mitscher. The battleship put to sea 27 January to serve
in the screen of the LEXINGTON carrier task group of Mitscher's
TF 58, and on 16 February her flattops launched the first
airstrikes against Japan since the famed Doolittle raid that had
been launched from carrier HORNET in April 1942.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MISSOURI then
steamed with the carriers to Iwo Jima where her Mighty guns
provided direct and continuous support to the invasion landings
begun 19 February. After TF 58 returned to Ulithi 5 March,
MISSOURI was assigned to the YORKTOWN carrier task group. On 14
March MISSOURI departed Ulithi in the screen of the fast carriers
and steamed to the Japanese mainland. During strikes against
targets along the coast of the Inland Sea of Japan beginning 18
March, MISSOURI splashed four Japanese aircraft.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Raids against
airfields and naval bases near the Inland Sea and southwestern
Honshu continued. WASP, crashed by an enemy suicide plane 19
March, resumed flight operations within an hour. Two bombs
penetrated the hangar deck and decks aft of carrier FRANKLIN,
leaving her dead in the water within 50 miles of the Japanese
mainland. Cruiser PITTSBURGH took Franklin in tow until she
gained speed to 14 knots. MISSOURI's carrier task group provided
cover for FRANKLIN's retirement toward Ulithi until 22 March,
then set course for preinvasion strikes and bombardment of
Okinawa.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MISSOURI joined
the fast battleships of TF 58 in bombarding the southeast coast
of Okinawa 24 March, an action intended to draw enemy strength
from the west coast beaches that would be the actual site of
invasion landings. MISSOURI rejoined the screen of the carriers
as Marine and Army units stormed the shores of Okinawa on the
morning of 1 April. Planes from the carriers shattered a special
Japanese attacking force led by battleship YAMATO 7 April.
YAMATO, the world's largest battlewagon, was sunk, as were a
cruiser and a destroyer. Three other enemy destroyers were
heavily damaged and scuttled. Four remaining destroyers, sole
survivors of the attacking fleet, were damaged and retired to
Sasebo.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 11 April
MISSOURI opened fire on a low-flying suicide plane which
penetrated the curtain of her shells to crash just below her main
deck level. The starboard wing of the plane was thrown far
forward, starting a gasoline fire at 5-inch Gunmount No. 3. Yet
the battleship suffered only superficial damage, and the fire was
brought quickly under control.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">About 2305 on 17
April, MISSOURI detected an enemy submarine 12 miles from her
formation. Her report set off a hunter-killer operation by
carrier BATAAN and four destroyers which sank Japanese submarine
I-56.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MISSOURI was
detached from the carrier task force off Okinawa 5 May and sailed
for Ulithi. During the Okinawa campaign she had shot down five
enemy planes, assisted in the destruction of six others, and
scored one probable kill. She helped repel 12 daylight attacks of
enemy raiders and fought off four night attacks on her carrier
task group. Her shore bombardment destroyed several gun
emplacements and many other military, governmental, and
industrial structures.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MISSOURI arrived
Ulithi 9 May and thence proceeded to Apra Harbor, Guam, 18 May.
That afternoon Adm. William F. Halsey, Jr., Commander 3d Fleet,
broke his flag in MISSOURI. She passed out of the harbor 21 May,
and by 27 May was again conducting shore bombardment against
Japanese positions on Okinawa. MISSOURI now led the mighty 3d
Fleet in strikes on airfields and installations on Kyushu 2 and 3
June. She rode out a fierce storm 5 and 6 June that wrenched off
the bow of cruiser PITTSBURGH. Some topside fittings were
smashed, but MISSOURI suffered no major damage. Her fleet again
struck Kyushu 8 June, then hit hard in a coordinated air-surface
bombardment before retiring towards Leyte. She arrived San Pedro,
Leyte, 13 June, after almost 3 months of continuous operations in
support of the Okinawa campaign.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Here she prepared
to lead the 3d Fleet in strikes at the heart of Japan from within
its home waters. The mighty fleet set a northerly course 8 July
to approach the Japanese mainland. Raids took Tokyo by surprise
10 July, followed by more devastation at the juncture of Honshu
and Hokkaido 13 and 14 July. For the first time, a naval gunfire
force wrought destruction on a major installation within the home
islands when MISSOURI closed the shore to join in a bombardment
15 July that rained destruction on the Nihon Steel Co. and the
Wanishi Ironworks at Muroran, Hokkaido.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">During the night
of 17-18 July MISSOURI bombarded industrial targets in the
Hichiti area, Honshu. Inland Sea aerial strikes continued through
25 July, and MISSOURI guarded the carriers as they struck hard
blows at the Japanese capital. As July ended the Japanese no
longer had any home waters. MISSOURI had led her fleet to gain
control of the air and sea approaches to the very shores of
Japan.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Strikes on
Hokkaido and northern Honshu resumed 9 August, the day the second
atomic bomb was dropped. Next day, at 2054 MISSOURI's men were
electrified by the unofficial news that Japan was ready to
surrender, provided that the Emperor's prerogatives as a
sovereign ruler were not compromised. Not until 0745, 15 August,
was word received that President Truman had announced Japan's
acceptance of unconditional surrender.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Adm. Sir Bruce
Fraser, RN (Commander, British Pacific Fleet) boarded MISSOURI 16
August, and conferred the order Knight of the British Empire upon
Admiral Halsey. MISSOURI transferred a landing party of 200
officers and men to battleship IOWA for temporary duty with the
initial occupation force for Tokyo 21 August. MISSOURI herself
entered Tokyo Bay early 29 August to prepare for the formal
surrender ceremony.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">High-ranking
military officials of all the Allied Powers were received on
board 2 September. Fleet Adm. Chester Nimitz boarded shortly
after 0800, and General of the Army Douglas MacArthur (Supreme
Commander for the Allies) came on board at 0843. The Japanese
representatives, headed by Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu,
arrived at 0856. At 0902 General MacArthur stepped before a
battery of microphones and the 23-minute surrender ceremony was
broadcast to the waiting world. By 0930 the Japanese emissaries
had departed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The afternoon of 6
September Admiral Halsey transferred his flag to battleship SOUTH
DAKOTA. Early next day MISSOURI departed Tokyo Bay to receive
homeward bound passengers at Guam, thence sailed unescorted for
Hawaii. She arrived Pearl Harbor 20 September and flew Admiral
Nimitz' flag on the afternoon of 28 September for a reception.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The next day
MISSOURI departed Pearl Harbor bound for the eastern seaboard of
the United States. ,She reached New York City 28 September and
broke the flag of Adm. Jonas Ingram, Commander in Chief, Atlantic
Fleet, MISSOURI boomed out a 21-gun salute 27 October as
President Truman boarded for Navy day ceremonies. In his address
the President stated that &quot;control of our sea approaches and
of the skies above them is still the key to our freedom and to
our ability to help enforce the peace of the world.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After overhaul in
the New York Naval Shipyard and a training cruise to Cuba,
MISSOURI returned to New York. The afternoon of 21 March I946 she
received the remains of the Turkish Ambassador to the United
States, Melmet Munir Ertegun. She departed 22 March for Gibraltar
and 5 April anchored in the Bosphorus off Istanbul. She rendered
full honors, including the firing of a 19-gun salute during both
the transfer of the remains of the late Ambassador and the
funeral ashore.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MISSOURI departed
Istanbul 9 April and entered Phaleron Bay, Piraeus, Greece, the
following day for an overwhelming welcome by Greek government
officials and people. She had arrived in a year when there were
ominous Russian overtures and activities in the entire Balkan
area. Greece had become the scene of a Communist-inspired civil
war, as Russia sought every possible extension of Soviet
influence throughout the Mediterranean region. Demands were made
that Turkey grant the Soviets a base of seapower in the
Dodecanese Islands and joint control of the Turkish Straits
leading from the Black Sea into the Mediterranean.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The voyage of
MISSOURI to the eastern Mediterranean gave comfort to both Greece
and Turkey. News media proclaimed her a symbol of U.S. interest
in preserving Greek and Turkish liberty. With an August decision
to deploy a strong fleet to the Mediterranean, it became obvious
that the United States intended to use her naval sea and air
power to stand firm against the tide of Soviet subversion.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MISSOURI departed
Piraeus 26 April, touching at Algiers and Tangiers before
arriving Norfolk 9 May. She departed for Culebra Island 12 May to
join Admiral Mitscher's 8th'Fleet in the Navy's first large-scale
postwar Atlantic training maneuvers. The battleship returned to
New York City 27 May, and spent the next year steaming Atlantic
coastal waters north to the Davis Straits and south to the
Caribbean on various Atlantic command training exercises.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MISSOURI arrived
Rio de Janeiro 30 August 1947 for the InterAmerican Conference
for the Maintenance of Hemisphere Peace and Security. President
Truman boarded 2 September to celebrate the signing of the Rio
Treaty which broadened the Monroe Doctrine, stipulating that an
attack on one of the signatory American States would be
considered an attack on all.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The Truman family
boarded MISSOURI 7 September to return to the United States and
debarked at Norfolk 19 September. Overhaul in New York (23
September to 10 March 1948) was followed by refresher training at
Guantanamo Bay. Summer 1948 was devoted to midshipman and reserve
training cruises. The battleship departed Norfolk 1 November for
a second 3-week Arctic cold weather training cruise to the Davis
Straits. The next 2 years MISSOURI participated in Atlantic
command exercises ranging from the New England coast to the
Caribbean, alternated with two midshipman summer training
cruises. She was overhauled at Norfolk Naval Shipyard 23
September 1949 to 17 February 1950.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Now the only U.S.
battleship in commission, MISSOURI was proceeding seaward on a
training mission from Hampton Roads early 17 January when she ran
aground at a point 1.6 miles from Thimble Shoals Light, near Old
Point Comfort. She traversed shoal water a distance of three ship
lengths from the main channel. Lifted some 7 feet above
waterline, she struck hard and fast. With the aid of tugs,
pontoons, and an incoming tide, she was refloated 1 February.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">From mid-February
until 15 August MISSOURI conducted midshipman and reserve
training cruises out of Norfolk. She departed Norfolk 19 August
to support U.N. forces in their fight against Communist
aggression in Korea. MISSOURI joined the U.N. just west of Kyushu
14 September, becoming flagship of Rear Adm. A. E. Smith. The
first American battleship to reach Korean waters, she bombarded
Samchok 15 September in a diversionary move coordinated with the
Inchon landings. In company with cruiser HELENA and two
destroyers, she helped prepare the way for the 8th Army
offensive.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MISSOURI arrived
Inchon 19 September, and 10 October became flagship of Rear Adm.
J. M. Higgins, commander, Cruiser Division 5. She arrived Sasebo
14 October, where she became flagship of Vice Adm. A. D. Struble,
Commander, 7th Fleet. After screening carrier VALLEY FORGE along
the east coast of Korea, she conducted bombardment missions 12 to
26 October in the Chonjin and Tanchon areas, and at Wonsan. After
again screening carriers eastward of Wonsan she moved into
Hungnam 23 December to provide gunfire support about the Hungnam
defense perimeter until the last U.N, troops, the U.S. 3d
Infantry Division, were evacuated by way of the sea on Christmas
Eve.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MISSOURI conducted
additional operations with carriers and systematic shore
bombardments off the east coast of Korea until 19 March 1951. She
arrived Yokosuka 24 March, and 4 days later was relieved of duty
in the Far East. She departed Yokosuka 28 March, and upon arrival
Norfolk 27 April became flagship of Rear Adm. J. L. Holloway,
Jr., commander, Cruiser Force, Atlantic Fleet. Summer 1951 she
engaged in two midshipman training cruises to northern Europe.
MISSOURI entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard 18 October for overhaul
until 30 January 1952.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Following winter
and spring training out of Guantanamo Bay, Missouri visited New
York, then set course from Norfolk 9 June for another midshipman
cruise. She returned to Norfolk 4 August and entered Norfolk
Naval Shipyard to prepare for a second tour in the Korean Combat
Zone.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MISSOURI stood out
of Hampton Roads 11 September and arrived Yokosuka 17 October.
She broke the flag of Vice Adm. J. J.. Clark, commander of the
7th Fleet, 19 October. Her primary mission was to provide
seagoing artillery support by bombarding enemy targets In the
Chaho-Tanchon area, at Chongjin, in the Tanchon-Sonjin area, and
at Chaho, Wonsan, Hamhung, and Hungnam during the period 15
October through 2 January 1953.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MISSOURI put in to
Inchon 5 January 1953 and sailed thence to Sasebo, Japan. Gen.
Mark Clark, Commander in Chief, U.N. Command, and Adm. Sir Guy
Russell, RN, commander of the British Far East Station, visited
the battleship 23 January. In the following weeks, MISSOURI
resumed &quot;Cobra&quot; patrol along the east coast of Korea in
direct support of troops ashore. Repeated strikes against Wonsan,
Tanchon, Hungnam, and Kojo destroyed main supply routes along the
eastern seaboard.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The last gunstrike
mission by MISSOURI was against the Kojo area 25 March. she
sustained a grievous casualty 26 March, when her commanding
officer Capt. Warner R. Edsall suffered a fatal heart attack
while conning her through the submarine net at Sasebo. She was
relieved as 7th Fleet flagship 6 April by battleship NEW JERSEY.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MISSOURI departed
