<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The third ALABAMA
(BB-60) was laid down on 1 February 1940 by the Norfolk (Va.)
Navy Yard; launched on 16 February 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Lister
Hill, wife of the senior Senator from ALABAMA; and commissioned
on 16 August 1942, Capt. George B. Wilson in command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After fitting out,
ALABAMA commenced her shakedown cruise in Chesapeake Bay on
Armistice Day (11 November) 1942. As the year 1943 began, the new
battleship headed north to conduct operational training out of
Casco Bay, Maine. She returned to Chesapeake Bay on 11 January
1943 to carry out the last week of shakedown training. Following
a period of availability and logistics support at Norfolk,
ALABAMA was assigned to Task Group (TG) 22.2, and returned to
Casco Bay for tactical maneuvers on 13 February 1943.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">With the movement
of substantial British strength toward the Mediterranean theater,
to prepare for the invasion of Sicily, the Royal Navy lacked the
heavy ships necessary to cover the northern convoy routes. The
British appeal for help on those lines soon led to the temporary
assignment of ALABAMA and SOUTH DAKOTA (BB-57) to the Home Feet.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 2 April 1943,
ALABAMA-as part of Task Force (TF) 22 sailed for the Orkney
Islands with her sister ship and a screen of five destroyers. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Proceeding via
Little Placentia Sound, Argentia, Newfoundland, the battleship
reached Scapa Flow on 19 May 1943, reporting for duty with TF 61
and becoming a unit of the British Home Fleet. She soon embarked
on a period of intensive operational training to coordinate joint
operations.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Early in June,
ALABAMA and her sister ship, along with British Home Fleet units,
covered the reinforcement of the garrison on the island of
Spitzbergen, which lay on the northern flank of the convoy route
to Russia, in an operation that took the ship across the Arctic
Circle. Soon after her return to Scapa Flow, she was inspected by
Admiral Harold R. Stark, Commander, United States Naval Forces,
Europe.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Shortly
thereafter, in July, ALABAMA participated in Operation
&quot;Governor,&quot; a diversion aimed toward southern Norway,
to draw German attention away from the real Allied thrust, toward
Sicily. It had also been devised to attempt to lure out the
German battleship TIRPITZ, the sister ship of the famed, but
short-lived, BISMARCK, but the Germans did not rise to the
challenge, and the enemy battleship remained in her Norwegian
lair.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ALABAMA was
detached from the British Home Fleet on 1 August 1943, and, in
company with South Dakota and screening destroyers, sailed for
Norfolk, arriving there on 9 August. For the next ten days,
ALABAMA underwent a period of overhaul and repairs. This work
completed, the battleship departed Norfolk on 20 August 1943 for
the Pacific. Transiting the Panama Canal five days later, she
dropped anchor in Havannah Harbor, at Efate, in the New Hebrides,
on 14 September.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Following a month
and a half of exercises and training, with fast carrier task
groups, the battleship moved to Fiji on 7 November. ALABAMA
sailed on 11 November to take part in operation
&quot;Galvanic&quot;, the assault on the Japanese-held Gilbert
Islands. She screened the fast carriers as they launched attacks
on Jaluit and Mille atolls, Marshall Islands, to neutralize
Japanese airfields located there. ALABAMA supported landings on
Tarawa on 20 November and later took part in the securing of
Betio and Makin. On the night of 26 November, ALABAMA twice
opened fire to drive off enemy aircraft that approached her
formation.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 8 December
1943, ALABAMA, along with five other fast battleships, carried
out the first Pacific gunfire strike conducted by that type of
warship. ALABAMA's guns hurled 535 rounds into enemy strong
points, as she and her sister ships bombarded Nauru Island, an
enemy phosphate-producing center, causing severe damage to shore
installations there. She also took the destroyer BOYD (DD-644),
alongside after that ship had received a direct hit from a
Japanese shore battery on Nauru, and brought three injured men on
board for treatment.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">She then escorted
the carriers BUNKER HILL (CV-17) and MONTEREY (CVL-26) back to
Efate, arriving on 12 December. ALABAMA departed the New Hebrides
for Pearl Harbor on 5 January 1944, arrived on the 12th, and
underwent a brief drydocking at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard. After
replacement of her port outboard propeller, and routine
maintenance, ALABAMA was again underway to return to action in
the Pacific.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ALABAMA reached
Funafuti, Ellice Islands, on 21 January 1944, and there rejoined
the fleet. Assigned to Task Group (TG) 58.2, which was formed
around Essex (CV-9), ALABAMA left the Ellice Islands on 25
January to help carry out Operation &quot;Flintlock,&quot; the
invasion of the Marshall Islands. ALABAMA, along with sister ship
South Dakota and the fast battleship NORTH CAROLINA (BB55),
bombarded Roi on 29 January and Namur on 30 January; she hurled
330 rounds of 16-inch and 1,562 of 5-inch toward Japanese
targets, destroying planes, airfield facilities, blockhouses,
buildings, and gun emplacements. Over the following days of the
campaign, ALABAMA patrolled the area north of Kwajalein Atoll. On
12 February 1944, ALABAMA sortied with the BUNKER HILL task group
to launch attacks on Japanese installations, aircraft and
shipping at Truk. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Those raids,
launched on 16 and 17 February, caused heavy damage to enemy
shipping concentrated at that island base.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Leaving Truk
ALABAMA began steaming toward the Marianas to assist in strikes
on Tinian, Saipan and Guam. During this action, while repelling
enemy air attacks on 21 February 1944, 5-inch mount no. 9
accidentally fired into mount no. 5. Five men died, and 11 were
wounded in the mishap.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After the strikes
were completed on 22 February, ALABAMA conducted a sweep looking
for crippled enemy ships southeast of Saipan, and eventually
returned to Majuro on 26 February 1944. There she served
temporarily as flagship for Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher,
Commander, TF 58, from 3 to 8 March.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ALABAMA's next
mission was to screen the fast carriers as they hurled air
strikes against Japanese positions on Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and
Woleai, Caroline Islands. She steamed from Majuro on 22 March
1944 with TF 58 in the screen of YORKTOWN (CV-10), On the night
of 29 March, about six enemy planes approached TG 58.3, in which
ALABAMA was operating, and four broke off to attack ships in the
vicinity of the battleship. ALABAMA downed one unassisted, and
helped in the destruction of another.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 30 March,
planes from TF 58 began bombing Japanese airfields, shipping,
fleet servicing facilities, and other installations on the
islands of Palau, Yap, Ulithi and Woleai. During that day,
ALABAMA again provided antiaircraft fire whenever enemy planes
appeared. At 2044 on the 30th, a single plane approached TG 58.3,
but ALABAMA and other ships drove it off before it could cause
any damage.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleship
returned briefly to Majuro, before she sailed on 13 April with TF
58, this time in the screen of ENTERPRISE (CV6). In the next
three weeks, TF 58 hit enemy targets on Hollandia, Wakde, Sawar,
and Sarmi along the New Guinea coast; covered Army landings at
Aitape, Tanahmerah Bay, and Humboldt Bay; and conducted further
strikes on Truk.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As part of the
preliminaries to the invasion of the Marianas, ALABAMA, in
company with five other fast battleships, shelled the large
island of Ponape, in the Carolines, the site of a Japanese
airfield and sea lane base. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As ALABAMA's Capt.
Fred T. Kirtland subsequently noted, the bombardment, of 70
minutes' duration, was conducted in a &quot;leisurely
manner.&quot; ALABAMA then returned to Majuro on 4 May 1944 to
prepare for the invasion of the Marianas.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After a month
spent in exercises and refitting, ALABAMA again got under way
with TF 58 to participate in Operation &quot;Forager.&quot; On 12
June, ALABAMA screened the carriers striking Saipan. On 13 June,
ALABAMA took part in a six-hour preinvasion bombardment of the
west coast of Saipan, to soften the defenses and cover the
initial minesweeping operations. Her spotting planes reported
that her salvoes had caused great destruction and fires in
Garapan town. Though the shelling appeared successful, it proved
a failure due to the lack of specialized training and experience
required for successful shore bombardment. Strikes continued as
troops invaded Saipan on 15 June.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 19 June, during
the Battle of the Philippine Sea, ALABAMA operated with TG 58.7,
providing antiaircraft support for the fast carriers against
attacking Japanese aircraft. The ships of TF 58 claimed 27 enemy
planes downed during the course of the action which later came to
be known as the &quot;Marianas Turkey Shoot.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In the first raid
that approached ALABAMA's formation, only two planes managed to
penetrate to attack her sistership SOUTH DAKOTA, scoring one bomb
hit that caused minor damage. An hour later a second wave,
composed largely of torpedo bombers, bore in, but ALABAMA's
barrage discouraged two planes from attacking South Dakota. The
intense concentration paid to the incoming torpedo planes left
one dive bomber nearly undetected, and it managed to drop its
load near ALABAMA; the two small bombs were near-misses, and
caused no damage.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">American
submarines sank two Japanese carriers and Navy pilots claimed a
third carrier. American pilots and antiaircraft gunners had
seriously depleted Japanese naval air power. Out of the 430
planes with which the enemy had commenced the Battle of the
Philippine Sea, only 35 remained operational afterward.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ALABAMA continued
patrolling areas around the Marianas to protect the American
landing forces on Saipan, screening the east carriers as they
struck enemy shipping, aircraft, and shore installations on Guam,
Tinian, Rota, and Saipan. She then retired to the Marshalls for
upkeep.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ALABAMA-as
flagship for Rear Admiral E. W. Hanson, Commander, Battleship
Division 9-left Eniwetok on 14 July 1944, sailing with the task
group formed around BUNKER HILL. She screened the fast carriers
as they conducted preinvasion attacks and support of the landings
on the island of Guam on 21 July. She returned briefly to
Eniwetok on 11 August. On 30 August she got underway in the
screen of Essex to carry out Operation &quot;Stalemate II&quot;
the seizure of Palau, Ulithi, and Yap. On 6 through 8 September,
the forces launched strikes on the Carolinas.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ALABAMA departed
the Carolines to sail to the Philippines and provided cover for
the carriers striking the islands of Cebu, Leyte, Bohol and
Negros from 12 to 14 September. The carriers launched strikes on
shipping and installations in the Manila Bay area on 21 and 22
September, and in the central Philippines area on 24 September.
ALABAMA retired briefly to Saipan on 28 September, then proceeded
to Ulithi on 1 October 1944.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 6 October 1944
ALABAMA sailed with TF 38 to support the liberation of the
Philippines. Again operating as part of a fast carrier task
group, ALABAMA protected the flattops while they launched strikes
on Japanese facilities at Okinawa, in the Pescadores and Formosa.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Detached from the
Formosa area on 14 October to sail toward Luzon, the fast
battleship again used her antiaircraft batteries in support of
the carriers as enemy aircraft attempted to attack the formation.
ALABAMA's gunners claimed three enemy aircraft shot down and a
fourth damaged. By 15 October, ALABAMA was supporting landing
operations on Leyte. She then screened the carriers as they
conducted air strikes on Cebu, Negros, Panay, northern Mindanao,
and Leyte on 21 October 1944.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ALABAMA, as part
of the ENTERPRISE screen, supported air operations against the
Japanese Southern Force in the area off Surigao Strait then moved
north to strike the powerful Japanese Central Force heading for
San Bernardino Strait. After receiving reports of a third
Japanese force, the battleship served in the screen of the fast
carrier task force as it sped to Cape Engano. On 24 October,
although American air strikes destroyed four Japanese carriers in
the Battle off Cape Engano, the Japanese Central Force under
Admiral Kurita had transited San Bernardino Strait and emerged
off the coast of Samar, where it fell upon a task group of
American escort carriers and their destroyer and destroyer escort
screen. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ALABAMA reversed
her course and headed for Samar to assist the greatly outnumbered
American forces, but the Japanese had retreated by the time she
reached the scene. She then joined the protective screen for the
Essex task group to hit enemy forces in the central Philippines
before retiring to Ulithi on 30 October 1944 for replenishment.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Underway again on
3 November 1944, ALABAMA screened the fast carriers as they
carried out sustained strikes against Japanese airfields, and
installations on Luzon to prepare for a landing on Mindoro
Island. She spent the next few weeks engaged in operations
against the Visayas and Luzon before retiring to Ulithi on 24
November.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The first half of
December 1944 found ALABAMA engaged in various training exercises
and maintenance routines. She left Ulithi on 10 December, and
reached the launching point for air strikes on Luzon on 14
December, as the fast carrier task forces launched aircraft to
carry out preliminary strikes on airfields on Luzon that could
threaten the landings slated to take place on Mindoro. From 14 to
16 December, a veritable umbrella of carrier aircraft covered the
Luzon fields, preventing any enemy planes from getting airborne
to challenge the Mindoro-bound convoys. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Having completed
her mission, she left the area to refuel on 17 December; but, as
she reached the fueling rendezvous, began encountering heavy
weather. By daybreak on the 18th, rough seas and harrowing
conditions rendered a fueling at sea impossible; 50 knot winds
caused ships to roll heavily. ALABAMA experienced rolls of 30
degrees, had both her Vought &quot;Kingfisher&quot; float planes
so badly damaged that they were of no further value, and received
minor damage to her structure. At one point in the typhoon,
ALABAMA recorded wind gusts up to 83 knots. Three destroyers,
HULL (DD-350), MONAGHAN (DD-354), and SPENCE (DD512), were lost
to the typhoon. By 19 December, the storm had run its course; and
ALABAMA arrived back at Ulithi on 24 December. After pausing
there briefly, ALABAMA continued on to Puget Sound Naval
Shipyard, for overhaul.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleship
entered drydock on 18 January 1945, and remained there until 25
February. Work continued until 17 March, when ALABAMA got
underway for standardization trials and refresher training along
the southern California coast. She got underway for Pearl Harbor
on 4 April, arrived there on 10 April, and held a week of
training exercises. She then continued on to Ulithi and moored
there on 28 April 1945.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ALABAMA departed
Ulithi with TF 58 on 9 May 1945, bound for the Ryukyus, to
support forces which had landed on Okinawa on 1 April 1945, and
to protect the fast carriers as they launched air strikes on
installations in the Ryukyus and on Kyushu. On 14 May, several
Japanese planes penetrated the combat air patrol to get at the
carriers; one crashed Vice Admiral Mitscher's flagship. ALABAMA's
guns splashed two, and assisted in splashing two more.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Subsequently,
ALABAMA rode out a typhoon on 4 and 5 June, suffering only
superficial damage while the nearby heavy cruiser PITTSBURGH
(CA-7O) lost her bow, ALABAMA subsequently bombarded the Japanese
island of Minami Daito Shima, with other fast battleships, on 10
June 1945 and then headed for Leyte Gulf later in June to prepare
to strike at the heart of Japan with the 3d Fleet.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 1 July 1945,
ALABAMA and other 3d Fleet units got underway for the Japanese
home islands. Throughout the month of July 1945, ALABAMA carried
out strikes on targets in industrial areas of Tokyo and other
points on Honshu, Hokkaido, and Kyushu; on the night of 17 and 18
July, ALABAMA, and other fast battleships in the task group,
carried out the first night bombardment of six major industrial
plants in the Hitachi-Mito area of Honshu, about eight miles
northeast of Tokyo. On board ALABAMA to observe the operation was
retired Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, the famed polar explorer.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 9 August,
ALABAMA transferred a medical party to the destroyer AULT
(DD-698), for further transfer to the destroyer BORIE (DD-704).
The latter had been kamikazied on that date and required prompt
medical aid on her distant picket station.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The end of the war
found ALABAMA still at sea, operating off the southern coast of
Honshu. On 15 August 1945, she received word of the Japanese
capitulation. During the initial occupation of the Yokosuka-Tokyo
area, ALABAMA transferred detachments of marines and bluejackets
