1917, the day of declaration of war against Germany. She did not
sail to join the British Grand Fleet since she burned fuel oil
and tankers could not be spared to carry additional fuel to the
British Isles. In the light of this circumstance, only coal
burning battleships were selected for this mission. Based at
Yorktown, she kept in battle trim with Fleet maneuvers, tactics,
and training in the areas of the Chesapeake Bay, intervened by

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At the time of the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 7 December 1941, PENNSYLVANIA
was in drydock in the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard. She was one of the
first ships in the harbor to open fire as enemy dive bombers and
torpedo planes roared out of the high overcast. They did not
succeed in repeated attempts to torpedo the caisson of the
drydock but PENNSYLVANIA and the surrounding dock areas were
severely strafed. The crew of one 5-inch gun mount was wiped out
when a bomb struck the starboard side of her boat deck and
exploded inside casemate 9. Destroyers CASSIN and DOWNES, just
forward of PENNSYLVANIA in drydock were seriously damaged by bomb
hits. PENNSYLVANIA was pockmarked by flying fragments. A part of
a torpedo tube from destroyer DOWNES, about 1000 pounds in
weight, was blown onto the forecastle of PENNSYLVANIA. She had 15

PENNSYLVANIA. She maneuvered at full speed as the torpedo passed
safely astern. Destroyer EDWARDS teamed with FARRAGUT to hunt
down the attacker. After ten hours of relentless depth charge
attack submarine I-31 was forced to the surface and was shelled
by gunfire from EDWARDS. Severely damaged, the enemy survived

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Just before

disposition immediately executed a course change. For several
minutes after the explosion, a large fire lighted up the entire
area. Word soon came that escort carrier LISCOME BAY had been
torpedoed. She sank with tremendous loss of life. Determined
night air attacks were made by enemy torpedo planes on the nights

reached fire support station on the eastern coast of Leyte, 18
October, and commenced covering bombardment for beach
reconnaissance, underwater demolition teams, and minesweeping
units operating in Leyte Gulf and San Pedro Harbor. She conducted
bombardment missions the next day and supported the landings on
Leyte, 20 October. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Gunfire support
missions continued through 22 October, including harassing and
night illumination fire.On 24 October all available United States
vessels prepared for action as units of the Japanese Fleet closed
the Philippines, preliminary to the Battle for Leyte Gulf.
PENNSYLVANIA and five other battleships, with cruisers and
destroyers of Rear Admiral Oldendorf's Force, steamed south and
by nightfall were steaming slowly back and forth across the
northern entrance of Surigao Strait, awaiting the approach of the
enemy. That night, American motor torpedo boats stationed well
down in Surigao Strait made the first encounter with torpedo
attacks. Destroyers of the Force, on either flank of the enemy's
line of approach, followed with torpedo and gun attacks. At 0353,
26 October, WEST VIRGINIA opened fire, joined shortly thereafter
by other battleships and cruisers. The Japanese had run head on
into a perfect trap. Rear Admiral Oldendorf had executed the
dream of every naval tactician by crossing the enemy's
&quot;T&quot;. The Japanese lost two battleships and three
destroyers in the Battle of Surigao Strait. Cruiser MOGAMI in
company with a destroyer, all that remained of the enemy force,
managed to escape. Rear Admiral Oldendorf's Force did not suffer
the loss of a single vessel. MOGAMI was sunk the next day by
carrier planes.On 26 October 1944 ten enemy planes made a
simultaneous run on a destroyer close aboard PENNSYLVANIA which
assisted in splashing four and driving off the others. On the
night of 28 October, she shot down a bomber as it attempted a
torpedo run.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Remaining on
patrol in Leyte Gulf until 25 November, PENNSYLVANIA then steamed
to Manus, Admiralty Islands, and thence to Kossol Passage where
she loaded ammunition. She departed 1 January 1945 with Vice
Admiral Oldendorf's Lingayen Bombardment and Fire Support Group,
steaming for Lingayen Gulf. The Group came under heavy air
attacks 4-6 January and the escort carrier OMMANEY BAY was hit by
a suicide plane and destroyed by the resulting fire. Many other
ships were damaged.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On the morning of
6 January, PENNSYLVANIA commenced bombardment of target areas on
Santiago Island at the mouth of Lingayen Gulf. That afternoon she
entered the Gulf to conduct counterbattery fire in support of
minesweeping forces, retiring at night. At daybreak, 7 January,
the entire bombardment force entered Lingayen Gulf to deliver
supporting and destructive fire. Preliminary assault bombardment
was continued the next day. On 9 January, PENNSYLVANIA provided
gunfire support for the protection of the waves of landing
troops. Enemy aircraft attacked the force in Lingayen Gulf, 10
January. Four bombs landed close by, but PENNSYLVANIA was not
hit. That afternoon she executed her last call fire mission in
support of the operation by firing twelve rounds to destroy a
concentration of enemy tanks which had been located inland by a
shore fire control party.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">From 10 to 17
January PENNSYLVANIA conducted patrol in the South China Sea, off
Lingayen Gulf, with other ships of the task group. On 17 January
she anchored in Lingayen Gulf, remaining until 10 February when
she sailed for temporary repairs at Manus, Admiralty Islands.
Departing 22 February, she steamed via the Marshall Islands and
Pearl Harbor to San Francisco arriving 13 March. She entered the
Hunter's Point Shipyard and underwent thorough overhaul. Her main
battery turrets and secondary battery mounts were regunned.
Additional close range weapons as well as improved radar and fire
control equipment were installed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Upon completion of
overhaul, PENNSYLVANIA conducted trial runs out of San Francisco,
followed by refresher training while based at San Diego, Calif.
She departed San Francisco 12 July for Pearl Harbor, arriving 18
July. She sailed for Okinawa, 24 July. Enroute she took part in
the bombardment of Wake Island, I August, and, after loading
ammunition at Saipan the next day, resumed her voyage. She
anchored in Buckner Bay alongside TENNESSEE. On 12 August a
Japanese torpedo plane slipped in over Buckner Bay without
detection and launched a torpedo at PENNSYLVANIA which lay at
anchor. Hit well aft, PENNSYLVANIA suffered extensive damage.
Twenty men were killed and ten injured. Many compartments were
flooded and PENNSYLVANIA settled heavily b the stern. The
flooding was brought under control by efforts of PENNSYLVANIA's
repair parties and the prompt assistance of two salvage tugs. The
following day, she was towed to more shallow water where salvage
operations continued.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 18 August,
PENNSYLVANIA departed Buckner Bay, Okinawa, under tow of two
tugs. She arrived Apra Harbor, Guam 6 September and entered
drydock where a large sheet steel patch was welded over the
torpedo hole and repairs to permit her to return to the United
States under her own power were completed. On 4 October, she
sailed for the Puget Sound Navy Yard in company with destroyer
WALKE and cruiser ATLANTA. On 17 October number 3 shaft suddenly
carried away inside the stern tube and the shaft slipped aft. It
was necessary to send divers down to cut through the shaft,
letting the shaft and propeller drop into the sea. Shipping water
and with only one screw turning, PENNSYLVANIA limped into Puget
Sound Navy Yard, 24 October.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Repairs were made
to enable PENNSYLVANIA to steam to the Marshall Islands where she
was used as a target ship in the atomic bomb tests at Bikini
during July 1946. She was then towed to Kwajalein Lagoon where
she decommissioned 29 August 1946. She remained in Kwajalein
Lagoon for radiological and structural studies until 10 February
1948 when she was sunk off Kwajalein. She was struck from the
Navy List 19 February 1948.</font></p>
