<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The fifth
CALIFORNIA (BB- 41) was launched 20 November 1919 by Mare Island
Navy Yard; sponsored by Mrs. R. T. Zane; and commissioned 10
August 1921, Captain H. J. Ziegemeier in command; and reported to
the Pacific Fleet as flagship.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">For 20 years from
1921 until 1941, CALIFORNIA served first as flagship of the
Pacific Fleet, then as flagship of the Battle Fleet (Battle
Force), U.S. Fleet. Her annual activities included joint
Army-Navy exercises, tactical and organizational development
problems, and fleet concentrations for various purposes.
Intensive training and superior performance won her the Battle
Efficiency Pennant for 1921-22, and the Gunnery &quot;E&quot; for
1925-26.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In the summer of
1925 CALIFORNIA led the Battle Fleet and a division of cruisers
from the Scouting Fleet on a very successful good-will cruise to
Australia and New Zealand. She took part in the Presidential
reviews of 1927, 1930, and 1934. She was modernized in late 1929
and early 1930 and equipped with an improved antiaircraft
battery.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In 1940 CALIFORNIA
switched her base to Pearl Harbor On 7 December 1941 she was
moored at the southernmost berth of &quot;Battleship Row&quot;
and was with other dreadnoughts of the Battle Force when the
Japanese launched their aerial attack. As she was about to
undergo a material inspection, watertight integrity was not at
its maximum; consequently the ship suffered great damage when
hit. At 0805 a bomb exploded below decks, setting off an
antiaircraft ammunition magazine and killing about 50 men. A
second bomb ruptured her bow plates. Despite valiant efforts to
keep her afloat the inrushing water could not be isolated and
CALIFORNIA settled into the mud with only her superstructure
remaining above the surface. When the action ended, 98 of her
crew were lost and 61 wounded.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 26 March 1942
CALIFORNIA was refloated and dry docked at Pearl Harbor for
repairs. On 7 June she departed under her own power, for Puget
Sound Navy yard where a major reconstruction job was
accomplished, including improved protection, stability, AA
battery, and fire control system.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">CALIFORNIA
departed Bremerton 31 January 1944 for shakedown at San Pedro,
and sailed from San Francisco 5 May for the invasion of the
Marianas. Off Saipan in June, she conducted effective shore
bombardment and call fire missions. On 14 June she was hit by a
shell from an enemy shore battery which killed one man and
wounded nine. Following Saipan, her heavy guns helped blast the
way for our assault force in the Guam and Tinian operations (18
July-9 August). On 24 August she arrived at Espiritu Santo for
repairs to her port bow damaged in a collision with TENNESSEE
(BB-43).</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 17 September
1944 CALIFORNIA sailed to Manus to ready for the invasion of the
Philippines. From 17 October to 20 November she played a key role
in the Leyte operation, including the destruction of the Japanese
fleet in the Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October). On 1 January
1945 she departed the Palaus for the Luzon landings. Her powerful
batteries were an important factor in the success of these
dangerous operations driven home into the heart of enemy-held
territory under heavy air attack. On 6 January while providing
shore bombardment at Lingayen Gulf she was hit by a kamikaze
plane; 44 of her crew were killed and 155 were wounded. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Undeterred she
made temporary repairs on the spot and remained carrying out her
critical mission of shore bombardment until the job was done. She
departed 23 January for Puget Sound Navy Yard, arriving 15
February, for permanent repairs.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">CALIFORNIA
returned to action at Okinawa 15 June 1945 and remained in that
embattled area until 21 July. Two days later she joined TF 95 to
cover the East China Sea minesweeping operations. After a short
voyage to San Pedro Bay, P.I., in August, the ship departed
Okinawa 20 September to cover the landing of the 6th Army
occupation force at Wakanoura Wan, Honshu. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">She remained
supporting the occupation until 15 October, then sailed via
Singapore, Colombo, and Capetown, to Philadelphia, arriving 7
December. She was placed in commission in reserve there 7 August
1946: out of commission in reserve 14 February 1947; and sold 10
July 1959.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">CALIFORNIA
received seven battle stars for World War II service. </font></p>
