<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The fifth
TENNESSEE was laid down on 14 May 1917 at the New York Navy Yard;
launched on 30 April 1919; sponsored by Miss Helen Lenore
Roberts, daughter of the governor of TENNESSEE; and commissioned
on 3 June 1920, Capt. Richard H. Leigh in command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE and her
sister ship, CALIFORNIA (BB-44), were the first American
battleships built to a &quot;post-Jutland&quot; hull design. As a
result of extensive experimentation and testing, her underwater
hull protection was much greater than that of previous
battleships; and both her main and secondary batteries had
fire-control systems. The TENNESSEE class, and the three ships of
the Colorado-class which followed, were identified by two heavy
cage masts supporting large fire-control tops. This feature was
to distinguish the &quot;Big Five&quot; from the rest of the
battleship force until World War II. Since TENNESSEE's 14-inch
turret guns could be elevated to 30 degrees-rather than to the 15
degrees of earlier battleships-her heavy guns could reach out an
additional 10,000 yards. Because battleships were then beginning
to carry airplanes to spot long-range gunfire, TENNESSEE's
ability to shoot &quot;over the horizon&quot; had a practical
value.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After fitting out,
TENNESSEE conducted trials in Long Island Sound from 15 to 23
October 1920. While TENNESSEE was at New York, one of her
300-kilowatt ship's-service generators blew up on 30 October,
&quot;completely destroying the turbine end of the machine&quot;
and injuring two men. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Undaunted, the
ship's force, navy yard craftsmen, and manufacturers'
representatives labored to eliminate the &quot;teething
troubles&quot; in TENNESSEE's engineering system and enabled the
battleship to depart New York on 26 February 1921 for
standardization trials at Guantanamo. She next steamed north for
the Virginia Capes and arrived at Hampton Roads on 19 March.
TENNESSEE carried out gunnery calibration firing at Dahlgren,
Va., and was dry-docked at Boston before full-power trials off
Rockland, Maine. After touching at New York, she steamed south;
transited the Panama Canal; and, on 17 June, arrived at San
Pedro, Calif., her home port for the next 19 years.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Here, she joined
the Battleship Force, Pacific Fleet. In 1922, the Pacific Fleet
was redesignated the Battle Fleet (renamed the Battle Force in
1931), United States Fleet. For the next two decades, the
battleship divisions of the Battle Fleet were to include the
preponderance of the Navy's surface warship strength; and
TENNESSEE was to serve here until World War II.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Peacetime service
with the battleship divisions involved an annual cycle of
training, maintenance, and readiness exercises. Her yearly
schedule included competitions in gunnery and engineering
performance and an annual fleet problem, a large-scale war game
in which most or all of the United States Fleet was organized
into opposing forces and presented with a variety of strategic
and tactical situations to resolve. Beginning with Fleet Problem
I in 1923 and continuing through Fleet Problem XXI in April 1940,
TENNESSEE had a prominent share in these battle exercises. Yet
her individual proficiency was not neglected. During the
competitive year 1922 and 1923, she made the highest aggregate
score in the list of record practices fired by her guns of
various caliber and won the &quot;E&quot; for excellence in
gunnery. In 1923 and 1924, she again won the gunnery
&quot;E&quot; as well as the prized Battle Efficiency Pennant for
the highest combined total score in gunnery and engineering
competition. During 1925, she took part in joint Army-Navy
maneuvers to test the defenses of Hawaii before visiting
Australia and New Zealand. Subsequent fleet problems and tactical
exercises took TENNESSEE from Hawaii to the Caribbean and
Atlantic and from Alaskan waters to Panama.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Fleet Problem XXI
was conducted in Hawaiian waters during the spring of 1940. At
the end of this problem, the battleship force did not return to
San Pedro; but, at President Roosevelt's direction, its base of
operations was shifted to Pearl Harbor in the hope that this move
might deter Japanese expansion in the Far East. Following an
overhaul at the Puget Sound Navy Yard after the conclusion of
Fleet Problem XXI, TENNESSEE arrived at her new base on 12 August
1940. Due to the increasing deterioration of the world situation,
Fleet Problem XXII scheduled for the spring of 1941-was canceled;
and TENNESSEE's activities during these final months of peace
were confined to smaller scale operations.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On the morning of
7 December 1941, TENNESSEE was moored starboard side to a pair of
masonry &quot;mooring quays&quot; on Battleship Row, the name
given to a line if these deep water berths located along the
southeast side of Ford Island. WEST VIRGINIA (BB-48) was berthed
alongside to port. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Just ahead of
TENNESSEE was MARYLAND (BB-46), with OKLAHOMA (BB-37) outboard.
ARIZONA (BB-39), moored directly astern of TENNESSEE, was
undergoing a period of upkeep from the repair ship VESTAL (AR4),
berthed alongside her. The three &quot;nests&quot; were spaced
about 75 feet apart.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At about 0755,
Japanese carrier planes began their attack. As the first bombs
fell on Ford Island, TENNESSEE went to general quarters and
closed her watertight doors. In about five minutes, her
antiaircraft guns were manned and firing. Sortie orders were
received, and the battleship's engineers began to get steam up.
However, this quickly became academic as OKLAHOMA and WEST
VIRGINIA took crippling torpedo hits. OKLAHOMA capsized to port
and sank, bottom up. WEST VIRGINIA began to list heavily, but
timely counterflooding righted her. She, nevertheless, also
settled on the bottom but did so on an even keel. TENNESSEE,
though her guns were firing and her engines operational, could
not move. The sinking WEST VIRGINIA had wedged her against the
two massive concrete quays to which she was moored, and worse was
soon to come.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As the Japanese
torpedo bombers launched their weapons against Battleship Row,
dive bombers were simultaneously coming in from above. Strafing
fighters were attacking the ships' antiaircraft batteries and
control positions as high-level horizontal bombers dropped heavy
battleship-caliber projectiles modified to serve as
armor-piercing bombs. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Several bombs
struck ARIZONA; and, at about 0820, one of them penetrated her
protective deck and exploded in a magazine detonating
black-powder saluting charges which, in turn, set off the
surrounding smokeless-powder magazines. A shattering explosion
demolished ARIZONA's foreport, and fuel oil from her ruptured
tanks was ignited and began to spread. The torpedo hits on WEST
VIRGINIA had also released burning oil, and TENNESSEE's stern and
port quarter were soon surrounded by flames and dense black
smoke. At about 0830, horizontal bombers scored two hits on
TENNESSEE. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">One bomb carried
away the after mainyard before passing through the catapult on
top of Turret III, the elevated after turret, breaking up as it
partially penetrated the armored turret top. Large fragments of
the bomb case did some damage inside the turret and put one of
its three 14-inch guns out of operation. Instead of exploding,
the bomb filler ignited and burned, setting an intense fire which
was quickly extinguished.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The second bomb
struck the barrel of the center gun of Turret II, the forward
&quot;high&quot; turret, and exploded. The center gun was knocked
out of action, and bomb fragments sprayed TENNESSEE's forward
superstructure. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Capt. Mervyn S.
Bennion, the commanding officer of WEST VIRGINIA, had stepped out
on to the starboard wing of his ship's bridge only to be mortally
wounded by one of these fragments.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">While her physical
hurts were relatively minor, TENNESSEE was still seriously
threatened by oil fires raging around her stern. when ARIZONA's
magazines erupted, TENNESSEE's after decks were showered with
burning oil and debris which started fires that were encouraged
by the heat of the flaming fuel. Numerous blazes had to be fought
on the after portion of the main deck and in the officers'
quarters on the deck below. Shipboard burning was brought under
control by 1030, but oil flowing from the tanks of the adjacent
ships continued to flame.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">By the evening of
7 December, the worst was over. Oil was still blazing around
ARIZONA and WEST VIRGINIA and continued to threaten TENNESSEE for
two more days while she was still imprisoned by the obstacles
around her. Although her bridge and foremast had been damaged by
bomb splinters, her machinery was in full commission; and no
serious injury had been done to ship or gunnery controls. Ten of
her 12 14-inch guns and all of her secondary and antiaircraft
guns were intact. By comparison with most of the battleships
around her, TENNESSEE was relatively unscathed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The first order of
business was now to get TENNESSEE out of her berth. Just forward
of her, MARYLAND-similarly wedged into her berth when OKLAHOMA
rolled over and sank-was released and moved away on 9 December.
The forwardmost of TENNESSEE's two concrete mooring quays was
next demolished-a delicate task since the ship's hull was resting
against it-and had been cleared away by 16 December. TENNESSEE
carefully crept ahead, past OKLAHOMA's sunken hull, and moored at
the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Temporary repairs
were quickly made. From Turret III to the stern on both sides of
the ship, TENNESSEE's hull gave mute evidence of the inferno that
she had survived. Every piece of hull plating above the waterline
was buckled and warped by heat; seams had been opened and rivets
loosened. These seams had to be rewelded and rivets reset, and a
considerable amount of recaulking was needed to make hull and
weather decks watertight. The damaged top of Turret III received
a temporary armor patch.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 20 December,
TENNESSEE departed Pearl Harbor with PENNSYLVANIA (BB-38) and
MARYLAND-both superficially damaged in the Japanese attack-and a
screen of four destroyers. From the moment the ships put to sea,
nervous lookouts repeatedly sounded submarine alarms, making the
voyage something more than uneventful. Nearing the west coast,
PENNSYLVANIA headed for Mare Island while MARYLAND and TENNESSEE
steamed north, arrived at the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 29
December 1941, and commenced permanent repairs.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Working around the
clock during the first two months of 1942, shipyard craftsmen
repaired TENNESSEE's after hull plating and replaced electrical
wiring ruined by heat. To allow her antiaircraft guns a freer
field of fire, her tall cage mainmast was replaced by a tower
similar to that later installed in COLORADO (BB-46) and MARYLAND.
An air-search radar was installed; fire-control radars were
fitted to TENNESSEE's main battery and 5-inch antiaircraft gun
directors. Her three-inch and .50-caliber antiaircraft guns were
replaced by 1.1-inch and 20-millimeter automatic shell guns, and
her 5-inch antiaircraft guns were protected by splinter shields.
Fourteen-inch Mark-4 turret guns were replaced by improved
Mark-11 models. Other modifications improved the battleship's
habitability.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 26 February
1942, TENNESSEE departed Puget Sound with MARYLAND and COLORADO.
Upon arriving at San Francisco, she began a period of intensive
training operations with Rear Admiral William S. Pye's Task Force
1, made up of the Pacific Fleet's available battleships and a
screen of destroyers.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">However, her role
in the war was not to be in the line of battle for which she had
trained for two decades. Most of the great battles of the
conflict were not conventional surface-ship actions, but
long-range duels between fast carrier striking forces. Fleet
carriers, with their screening cruisers and destroyers, could
maintain relatively high force speeds; and a new generation of
fast battleships-beginning with the NORTH CAROLINA (BB-55)-class
and continuing into the SOUTH DAKOTA (BB57)-and IOWA
(BB-61)-classes-were coming into the fleet and were to prove
their worth in action with the fast carrier force. But the older
battleships-TENNESSEE and her kin-simply could not keep up with
the carriers. Thus, while the air groups dueled for the
approaches to Port Moresby and the Japanese naval offensive
reached its zenith in the waters west of Midway, the battleship
force found itself steaming restlessly on the sidelines.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 31 May, Admiral
Pye sent two of his battleships to search for a Japanese carrier
erroneously reported approaching the California coast. Reports of
the battle of Midway came in, and Pye sortied from San Francisco
on 6 June with the rest of his battleships and destroyers and the
escort carrier LONG ISLAND (AVG-1). The battleship force steamed
to an area some 1,200 miles west of San Francisco and about the
same distance northeast of Hawaii in the expectation that part of
the Japanese fleet might attempt an &quot;end run&quot; raid on
our Pacific coast. On 14 June, after it had become clear that
Admiral Yamamoto's fleet-reeling from its loss of four carriers
10 days before-had returned to Japanese waters, Pye ordered his
force back to San Francisco.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 1 August,
TENNESSEE again sailed from an Francisco with Task Force 1. After
a week of exercises the battleships joined HORNET (CV-8)-on her
way to the South Pacific to support the Guadalcanal operation and
escorted the carrier as far as Hawaii. Arriving at Pearl Harbor
on the 14th, TENNESSEE returned to Puget Sound on the 27th for
modernization. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">CALIFORNIA,
TENNESSEE's sister ship, had been sunk in shallow water during
the attack on Pearl Harbor. Refloated, and her hull temporarily
patched, she returned to Puget Sound in June for permanent
repairs which included a thorough modernization. It was decided
to include TENNESSEE in this program as well.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">By the time
TENNESSEE emerged from the navy yard on 7 May 1943, she bore
virtually no resemblance to her former self. Deep new blisters
increased the depth of her side protection against torpedoes by
eight feet-three inches on each side, gradually tapering toward
bow and stern. Internal compartmentation was rearranged and
improved. The most striking innovation was made in the
battleship's superstructure. The heavy armored conning tower,
from which TENNESSEE would have been controlled in a surface
gunnery action, was removed, as were masts, stacks, and other
superstructure. A new, compact, superstructure was designed to
provide essential ship and gunnery control facilities while
offering as little interference as possible to the fields of fire
of the ship's increasingly essential antiaircraft guns. A low
tower foremast supported a main-battery director and bridge
spaces; boiler uptakes were trunked into a single fat funnel
which was faired into the after side of the foremast. Just abaft
the stack, a lower structure accommodated the after turret-gun
director. TENNESSEE's old 5-inch battery, and combination of
5&quot;/25 antiaircraft guns and 5&quot;/51 single purpose
&quot;anti-destroyer&quot; guns, was replaced by eight 5&quot;/38
twin mounts. Four new directors, arranged around the
superstructure, could control these guns against air or surface
targets. All of these directors were equipped with fire-control
radars; antennas for surface- and air-search radars were mounted
at the mastheads. Close-in antiaircraft defense was the function
of 10 quadruple 40-millimeter gun mounts, each with its own
optical director, and of 43 20-millimeter guns.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Thus revitalized,
and her battleworthiness greatly increased, TENNESSEE ran trials
in the Puget Sound area and, on 22 May 1943, sailed for San
Pedro. The days of seeming purposelessness were over. Though the
slow battleships were still incapable of serving with the carrier
striking force, their heavy turret guns could still hit as hard
as ever. Naval shore bombardment and gunfire support for troops
ashore-then coming to be a specialty in its own right-was well
suited for this the earlier generation of battleships which were
also still quite usable for patrol duty in areas where fire-power
was more important than speed. The refurbished TENNESSEE's first
tour of duty combined both of these missions.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE departed
San Pedro with the cruiser PORTLAND (CA-33) on 31 May, bound for
the North Pacific, and arrived at Adak, Alaska, on 9 June to
begin patrol operations with Task Force 16, the North Pacific
Force. During the Midway operation, the Japanese had occupied the
Aleutian Islands of Attu and Kiska. Attu was recaptured in May
1943; but Kiska was still in hostile hands; and Japanese air and
naval forces still operated in the Aleutians area from bases in
the Kuril Islands. TENNESSEE plied back and forth through the
legendary fogs and foul weather of the Aleutians, with her crew
heavily bundled in arctic clothing for protection against intense
cold and freezing rain as her radars probed for some sign of the
enemy. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">There was still
much to be learned about radar and its pit-falls; on several
occasions, convincing images on the radar screens sent patrolling
forces to general quarters. During one patrol in July, radio
messages reported a force of nine surface ships 160 miles away,
steaming rapidly to intercept TENNESSEE and her consorts. Tension
grew as the unknown enemy drew closer, and all hands intently
prepared for their first action. The radar images were only 46
miles away, and TENNESSEE's crew were at battle stations when the
enemy suddenly disappeared. Where the screens had been displaying
what seemed to be a hostile squadron, there was nothing. The
hostile fleet had been a mere electronic mirage. During this same
period, another surface force fought a brief, but energetic,
gunnery action with the same kind of electronic &quot;ghost&quot;
force south of Kiska. Distant land masses had appeared on ships'
early radar sets as ship contacts at much closer ranges.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At about noon on 1
August, TENNESSEE was out on what all thought another routine
patrol when the word was passed to prepare to bombard Kiska. At
1310, she began a zigzag approach through the usual murk to the
island with IDAHO (BB-42) and three destroyers. As the water grew
more shallow, the ship slowed down and streamed mine-cutting
paravanes from her bows. TENNESSEE approached the island from the
east, closing to a range from which she could open fire with her
5-inch secondary battery. Her two OS2U Kingfisher floatplanes
were catapulted to observe fire; and, at 1610, the battleship
commenced firing from 7,000 yards. Though the island's shoreline
could be seen, the target area antiaircraft gun sites on high
ground-were shrouded in low hanging clouds and were invisible
from the ship. TENNESSEE's aerial spotters caught an occasional
glimpse of the impact area and reported the ship's fire as
striking home.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The task group
continued along Kiska's southern coast. TENNESSEE's 14-inch guns
chimed in at 1624, hitting the location of a submarine base and
other areas with 60 rounds before firing ceased at 1645.
Visibility had dropped to zero, and results could not be seen.
The battleship recovered her floatplanes, and the force turned
back toward Adak.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In the early
morning hours of 15 August, TENNESSEE again approached Kiska as
troops prepared to assault the island. At 0500, the ship's turret
guns began to fire at coastal-battery sites on nearby Little
Kiska as the 5-inch guns struck antiaircraft positions on that
island. The 14-inch guns then shifted their fire to antiaircraft
sites on the southern side of Kiska, while the secondary battery
turned its attention to an artillery observation position on
Little Kiska and set it on fire. The landing force then went
ashore, only to discover that nobody was home.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After the loss of
Attu, the Japanese, knowing that Kiska's turn would soon come,
decided to save the island's garrison. A small surface force
closed the island in dense fog and tight radio silence and, on 27
and 28 July 1948, succeeded in evacuating 6,188 troops from
Kiska.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Arriving at San
Francisco on 31 August, TENNESSEE began an intensive period of
training and carried out battle exercises off the southern
California coast before provisioning and shoving off for Hawaii.
After a week's exercises in the Pearl Harbor operating area, the
ship headed for the New Hebrides to rehearse for the invasion of
the Gilberts.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The Japanese had
occupied Betio on Christmas Day 1941. In nearly two years, with
the help of conscripted Korean laborers, they had done a thorough
job of digging themselves in. Americans still had a great deal to
learn about pre-landing bombardment. Air attacks and naval
gunfire damaged, but did not knock out, the beach defenses; and
the landing marines met an intense fire from artillery, mortars,
and machine guns. Casualties mounted rapidly, and the landing
force asked for all possible fire support: At 1084, TENNESSEE's
14-inch and 5-inch guns reopened fire. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleship
continued to shoot until 1138, resuming fire at 1224 and firing
until a cease-fire order was issued at 1300. The desperately
contested struggle went on until dark, with close support being
provided by destroyers which closed the beach to fire their
5-inch guns at short range and by waves of carrier planes which
bombed and strafed. To reduce the chance of submarine or air
attack, TENNESSEE and COLORADO withdrew for the night to an area
south-west of Betio and returned to their fire-support area the
next morning to provide antiaircraft protection for the
transports and to await a call for gunfire.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleships
retired to their night area again at dusk. By this time, the
battle for the island, its outcome uncertain for the first day
and one-half of fighting, had taken a definite turn for the
better. By 1600, the Marine commander ashore, Colonel David
Shoup, could radio back that &quot;we are winning.&quot;
TENNESSEE was back in position south of Betio on the morning of
the 22d. At 0907, she began to deliver call fire on Japanese
defenses at the eastern tip of Betio, dropping 70 rounds of
14inch and 322 rounds of 5-inch ammunition on gun positions in 17
minutes of shooting.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">During the
afternoon, the screening destroyers FRAZIER (DD-607) and MEADE
(DD-602) made a sonar contact. Depth charging drove I35, a
Japanese long-range submarine, to the surface. Her position was
hopeless, but the enemy crew scrambled to man the undersea boat's
single 5.5-inch deck gun as TENNESSEE's secondary guns joined
FRAZIER and MEADE in hurling 5-inch projectiles. TENNESSEE swung
clear as FRAZIER rammed the submarine; four minutes later, I-35
went to the bottom.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Betio was secured
by the afternoon of 23 November. TENNESSEE operated in the
general area of Tarawa and Abemama atolls, alert for possible
counterattacks by air or sea. At dusk on 3 December, TENNESSEE
departed the area for Pearl Harbor and, on the 16th, headed for
the United States with COLORADO and MARYLAND. On arrival at San
Francisco, four days before Christmas, she was quickly repainted
in a &quot;dazzle&quot; camouflage scheme designed to confuse
enemy observers. On 29 December, TENNESSEE be an intensive
bombardment practice, pounding San Clemente Island in rehearsal
for the invasion of the Marshall Islands.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In the early
morning of 13 January 1944, TENNESSEE set her course for Hawaii
with Task Unit 58.5.1 and anchored in Lahaina Roads off Maui, on
the 21st. That day, the ship was inspected by a group headed by
Undersecretary of the Navy James Forrestal. On the 29th,
TENNESSEE, with Forrestal on board, headed for the Marshalls.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">D-Day was set for
31 January 1944. As one attack force landed on the unoccupied
Majuro atoll, the major force approached Kwajalein. TENNESSEE,
PENNSYLVANIA, and two destroyers took up their stations 2,900
yards to the east of the atoll. At 0625, TENNESSEE catapulted off
her observation floatplanes; and, at 0701, she began throwing
14-inch salvoes at Japanese pillboxes on Roi Island. Her two
forward turrets were busily engaged when fire had to be checked
to allow carrier dive bombers to strike the island. Japanese
antiaircraft guns opened up on the planes. As soon as the
attackers were clear of the area, the ship demolished the enemy
guns with two three-gun salvoes, The 5-inch battery then opened
up on beach defenses. Main and secondary guns continued to pound
Roi and adjacent Namur until noon, the high point of the morning
coming when the guns of MOBILE (CL-63) detonated a Japanese
ammunition dump on Namur and sent an enormous mushroom of thick
black smoke into the air. At midday, TENNESSEE retired from the
firing area to recover and service her spotting planes. Following
a welcome midday meal served to the crew at their battle
stations, the battleship returned to be fighting and shelled Roi
and Namur through the afternoon. At 1700, TENNESSEE turned away
to screen supporting escort carriers for the night.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">While the fire
support ships pounded Roi and Namur on the 31st, marines captured
five small nearby islands; and the northern passage into
Kwajalein lagoon was cleared for ships to pass in. On 1 February,
TENNESSEE and COLORADO, with MOBILE and LOUISVILLE, were back in
their assigned area to be eastward and commenced firing at 0708.
The ships pounded Namur through the morning; marines began to
land on both islands at about noon; and TENNESSEE and her unit
continued supporting fire until 1245. Roi fell quickly, but
Namura's defenders were well dug in and fought fiercely until the
early afternoon on 2 February.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Later that day,
the battleship entered Kwajalein lagoon. Vice Admiral Raymond
Spruance and Rear Admiral Richard Conolly, commander of the
Roi-Namur invasion force, visited Mr. Forrestal on board
TENNESSEE; the Undersecretary and his party then went ashore to
inspect the newly seized islands and departed the following day
by seaplane.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Useful lessons
were learned from this operation. Since the Navy had won command
of the surface and in the air around the landing area, gunfire
support ships could close their objective and fire at what was,
for a battleship, virtually point-blank ranges. The heavy,
short-range fire of the supporting gunfire ships &quot;met the
most sanguine expectations&quot; of the assaulting marines and
foretold the shape of operations to come.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">By 7 February, the
whole Kwajalein atoll was in American hands; and preparations
began for the capture of Eniwetok atoll, at the northwest end of
the Marshalls group in the direction of the Marianas. Pre-war
Japanese security had been tight, and little was known about the
atoll, but aerial photographs and a Japanese chart found in a
beached enemy ship on one of Kwajalein's small islets gave
planners enough to work with.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE arrived
at Majuro on 7 February to take on ammunition and supplies before
returning to Kwajalein. On the afternoon of the 16th, she sailed
for Eniwetok with COLORADO, PENNSYLVANIA, and transports carrying
Army troops and marines. Ships of the fast carrier force screened
their approach and cruisers and destroyers opened the action on
the morning of 17 February by bombarding Eniwetok island, on the
southwest side of the circular atoll, and the smaller islands
flanking the selected entry to the lagoon, Deep Passage.
Minesweepers cleared Deep Passage and the nearby, though
shallower, Wide Passage; and, at 0915 TENNESSEE led the transport
convoy into the lagoon an headed for the atoll's northern island
of Engebi. The battleship bombarded Engebi while landing forces
went ashore on neighboring islets to site artillery pieces. Her
5-inch guns were active during the early evening in support of a
marine reconnaissance company which approached Engebi to plant
marker buoys for the next day's assault waves and to acquaint
themselves with the beaches. During the night, TENNESSEE drew off
into the lagoon as light field pieces from the newly captured
ground harassed Engebi's defenders. The pre-landing bombardment
began at 0700 the next morning, and TENNESSEE joined in at 0733.
The first wave went ashore at 0844 and, with the help of
supporting ships and planes, had Engebi in their hands by late
afternoon.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The atoll was not
yet secure. Japanese defenders on Eniwetok and Parry Islands had
carefully dug in and camouflaged their positions. Transports and
landing vehicles carried a force of soldiers and marines to the
southern end of the lagoon and, after a preparatory bombardment,
the troops went ashore on Eniwetok. There had not been enough
time to give the island a satisfactory softening, and progress
was slow.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE spent
the day anchored 5,500 yards north of the island, but her
services were not called for until night fell. During the night,
Army troops called several times for illumination. Destroyers
played their searchlights over Japanese-held areas, while
TENNESSEE's 5-inch guns fired large numbers of star shells. The
fight for Eniwetok went on into the afternoon of 21 February, but
TENNESSEE's efforts had, by then, been diverted to Parry Island.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Parry, at the
mouth of Deep Channel, was defended by more than 1,300
well-trained, carefully-entrenched Japanese troops. The assault
plan called for a careful preliminary working-over with bombs and
gunfire, and marine light howitzers began to shell Parry from a
nearby islet in the evening of 20 February while carrier planes
carried out repeated attacks. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE and
PENNSYLVANIA took up positions 900 yards off Parry during the
morning of the 20th and, at 1204, began to blast the island.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The bombardment
continued through the 21st, ships and planes taking their turns.
Gun crews paused for a &quot;breather&quot; while planes From the
escort carriers unloaded their ordnance, then resumed their work.
COLORADO's 16-inch rifles added to the weight of TENNESSEE and
PENNSYLVANIA's 14-inch fire, and LOUISVILLE and INDIANAPOLIS
joined in with their 8-inch turret guns. TENNESSEE was firing at
so short a range that, during the afternoon of the 20th, she was
able to take on beach defenses with her 40-millimeter guns.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The final
shelling, on the morning of 22 February, kicked up a dense
mixture of smoke and dust as the landing craft went in.
TENNESSEE's heavy guns checked fire at 0852 when the first
amphibian tractors were 300 yards from the beach, and her
40millimeters took up the fire until the vehicles landed. Ships'
guns continued to provide support during the first two hours of
land fighting but ceased firing as the troops expanded their
foothold and advanced across the island. By afternoon, Parry was
secured, and Eniwetok atoll was securely in American hands.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 23 February
1944, TENNESSEE sailed for Majuro. Here, she joined NEW MEXICO
(BB-40), MISSISSIPPI (BB-41), and IDAHO (BB42). Under the command
of Rear Admiral Robert M. Griffin, the battleships sortied from
Majuro on 15 March with two escort carriers and a screen of 15
destroyers.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Their objective
was the Japanese air and naval base at Kavieng, at the northern
end of New Ireland. The Bismarck Archipelago-the two large
islands of New Britain and New Ireland-lie just to the east of
New Guinea. Rabaul, the by-low legendary Japanese operating base,
is at the eastern end of New Britain, just across a narrow
channel from New Ireland. About 240 miles northwest of Rabaul,
across the Bismarck Sea, is the small Admiralty Island group.
Another small island, Emirau, lies northwest of New Ireland and
east of the Admiralties. Southeast from Rabaul, the Solomons
chain extended for more than five hundred miles. Since the first
landing on Guadalcanal in August 1942, the chain had been slowly
climbed in a series of strongly contested actions by sea, land,
and air. By the end of 1943, American forces held a strong
foothold on Bougainville, little more than 200 miles from Rabaul.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The final steps in
Rabaul's encirclement and isolation were planned for the spring
of 1944. Kavieng was to have been captured early in April, but
the success of the land-based air offensive against Rabaul
convinced Admiral Nimitz that it would be more profitable to
occupy undefended Emirau instead, sending the bombardment ships
against Kavieng to convince the Japanese that a landing on New
Ireland was planned.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Admiral Griffin,
accordingly, headed for Kavieng and, on the morning of 20 March
1944, approached the harbor. Rain squalls and low-hanging clouds
shrouded the area as TENNESSEE and the other gunfire ships
zigzagged toward New Ireland. The island appeared through the
overcast at about 0700. TENNESSEE launched her spotting planes an
hour later, and they were soon out of sight in the rain and mist.
By 0905, the range to the target was within 15,000 yards, and the
battleships opened a deliberate fire. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Steaming at 15
knots, TENNESSEE dropped single 14-inch rounds and two or
three-gun salvoes on Kavieng as the bombardment force slowly
closed the range. Poor visibility made gunfire spotting
difficult, and the pace of firing was held down to avoid wasting
ammunition.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE was
about 7,500 yards from the island when her lookouts reported gun
flashes from the beach, quickly followed by shell splashes just
off the starboard bow and close to one of her screening
destroyers. At 0928, TENNESSEE's port 5-inch guns opened rapid
continuous fire at the coastal battery, estimated to consist of
four to six 4-inch guns. A 180-degree turn brought the
battleship's starboard secondaries to bear, and the duel
continued. The Japanese gunners began to get the range, and some
projectiles hit close aboard on the starboard beam while others
came similarly close to IDAHO. TENNESSEE was straddled several
times and drew away from the shore at 18 knots before checking
fire at 0934. Reducing speed to 15 knots and turning back to
firing position, TENNESSEE reopened fire at 0936. Her main and
secondary batteries pounded the enemy guns for 10 minutes, and
nothing more was heard from the Japanese guns. For the next three
hours, the ships steamed back and forth off Kavieng, shelling the
Japanese airfield and shore facilities. Other coastal gun
positions were sighted, but the battleship's 14-inch fire
silenced them before they could get off a round. Visibility
continued to be a problem; observers in the ships' floatplanes
could not get a clear view of the targets. When the 5-inch guns
were firing at targets in wooded areas, spotters in the ship's
gun directors could not observe hits in the heavy foliage. More
than once, rounds had to be dropped in the water to obtain a
definite point of reference before &quot;walking&quot; fire onto
the desired target.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The bombardment
ended at 1235. TENNESSEE turned away and made rendezvous with the
covering escort carriers as Admiral Halsey wired his
&quot;congratulations on your effective plastering of
Kavieng.&quot; This diversion had had its effect. While Admiral
Griffin's battleships blasted Kavieng, Emirau had been seized
without opposition. Pausing at Purvis Bay and Efate, TENNESSEE
arrived at Pearl Harbor on 16 April to refurbish and prepare for
her next task.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Operation
&quot;Forager,&quot; the assault on the Marianas, was planned as
a two-pronged thrust. Vice Admiral Richmond K, Turner's Task
Force 51 was organized into a Northern Attack Force (TF 52),
under his command, and a Southern Attack Force (TF 53) under Rear
Admiral Richard Conolly. While TF 52 attacked Saipan and nearby
Tinian, Conolly's TF 52 was aimed at Guam. The bombardment and
fire support force arrayed for this operation included TENNESSEE
and seven other older battleships, 11 cruisers, and about 26
destroyers. These ships were divided into two fire support
groups, TENNESSEE, with CALIFORNIA, MARYLAND, and COLORADO, was
assigned to Fire Support Group One (TG 52.17) under Rear Admiral
Jesse Oldendorf.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The Northern
Attack Force assembled at Hawaii in mid-May 1944. After
rehearsals off Maui and Kahoolawe, Fire Support Group One sailed
for Kwajalein while the transports staged at Eniwetok. On 10 June
1944, TENNESSEE and her task group departed Kwajalein, bound for
Saipan. Early on 13 June, as the force approached the Marianas,
signs of Japanese activity began to appear, A patrol plane
reported sighting a surfaced submarine some 20 miles ahead and
attacked it. Another plane shot down a land-based Mitsubishi G4M
&quot;Betty&quot; which had been trailing along 10 miles astern
of the ships. Another submarine contact was reported to port of
the formation, and screening destroyers dropped depth charges.
During the 13th, Vice Admiral Willis .A. Lee's Task Group
68.7-seven new fast battleships of the NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH
DAKOTA, and IOWA classes - temporarily detached from Vice Admiral
Marc Mitscher's Task Force 68 - hurled a furious bombardment at
Saipan.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Throughout the
following night, lookouts reported gun flashes on the horizon,
and escorting destroyers attacked suspected submarines. General
quarters was sounded at 0400 on 14 June as the old battleships
drew near to Saipan. Near the horizon, a Japanese cargo ship, set
afire by the guns of MELVIN (DD-680), burned brightly. Shortly
before dawn, Oldendorf's battleships passed to the north of
Saipan as the second fire-support group steamed through Saipan
Channel at the southern end of the island. The southern group
opened fire at 0539. Nine minutes later, TENNESSEE began a
methodical bombardment of the selected landing area, the southern
portion of Saipan's west coast, in support of minesweepers
carrying out an assault sweep on the landing zone. Enemy coastal
guns had fired a few shots at Oldendorf's ships as they rounded
the northern tip of the island, and attacking carrier planes as
well as the ships' observation floatplanes encountered heavy
anti-aircraft fire. MARYLAND drew fire from a battery concealed
on a tiny islet off Tanapag harbor. She and CALIFORNIA turned on
this foe and soon silenced it.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Released from this
duty, TENNESSEE sailed southward to the area of Agingan Point, at
the southwest corner of Saipan and the southern end of the
designated landing area. Underwater demolition teams (UDT)
approached the beach in small craft to reconnoiter the landing
beaches and to plant radar beacons which would provide reference
points to the next day's landing. TENNESSEE closed to 3,000 yards
of Agingan Point and, at 0831, opened up with 14-inch, 5-inch,
and 40-millimeter batteries. Some smoldering powder grains from
the 5-inch guns fell on the port side of the battleship's
quarterdeck and burst into flame, but were quickly extinguished.
Japanese guns dropped shells near the UDT's as mortars and
machine guns joined in; at about 0920, projectile splashes began
to appear near the supporting ships as batteries on nearby Tinian
opened fire. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">CLEVELAND (CL-56)
was straddled, and CALIFORNIA and BRAMIE (DD-630) took hits.
TENNESSEE aimed counterbattery fore at the defenders who were
opposing the UDT's, and her turret guns fired at Tinian. Shortly
before noon, she moved to the northwest to bombard Japanese
fortifications on Afetna Point, near the center of the landing
zone. At 1331, the ship ceased fire and withdrew from the firing
area to recover her seaplanes, later closing WADLEIGH (DD-689)
and BROOKS (APD-10) to take on board five wounded UDT men for
treatment. She joined the rest of her fire support group and took
up night stations to the west of Saipan.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">D-Day on Saipan
was 15 June 1944. Circling to the north of the island, well out
of sight from shore during the last hours of darkness the assault
force was off the landing beaches by day. Reserve landing forces
staged an elaborate feint off Tanapag harbor, hoping to induce
the Japanese to reinforce its defenses before the actual landing
took place further south. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At 0430, the
pre-landing bombardment began. TENNESSEE joined in at 0640 with a
heavy barrage from her main, secondary and 40-millimeter guns
from 3,000 yards west of Agingan Point. At 0642, the landing
craft and amphibian tractors of the landing force began to load
and assemble for the movement to shore. Gunfire was lifted at
0630 to allow carrier planes to bombard the island's defenses,
resuming at 0700. At 0812, the assault waves headed for the
beach. The first went ashore at 0844 and met heavy opposition.
The pre-landing bombardment, though prolonged and intense, had
left much of the Japanese defenses still able to fight; and, as
the 2d and 4th Marine Divisions landed on a 4-mile front south of
Garapan, they found that much still remained to be done.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE's
assault station was off the southern end of the landing beach.
During the first wave's approach, her guns enfiladed that end of
the objective to prepare the way for the right-hand elements of
the 4th Division. She checked fire as the troops neared the
beach, resuming it a few minutes later as the marines fought to
establish themselves ashore. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Japanese 4.7-inch
field guns, emplaced in a cave on Tinian, opened on TENNESSEE.
The battleship commenced counterbattery fire, but the third enemy
salvo scored three hits, all of which burst on impact. One
projectile knocked out a 5-inch twin gun mount; the second struck
the ship's side, while the third tore a hole in the after portion
of main deck and sprayed fragments into the wardroom below. An
intense fire inside the disabled gun mount was subdued in two
minutes by repair parties and men from nearby gun crews; the hit
to the hull damaged external blister plating, but was prevented
from inflicting further damage by the battleship's heavy belt
armor. Eight men were killed by projectile fragments, while 26
more were wounded by fragments and flash burns. TENNESSEE's
damages did not prevent her from delivering call fire to help
break up a developing Japanese counterattack near Agingan Point
before leaving the firing line to make emergency repairs. During
the afternoon and night, she took station to screen assembled
transports. Four Japanese dive bombers attacked nearby ships at
1846, and TENNESSEE's 6-inch guns briefly engaged them but
claimed no hits. That evening, TENNESSEE buried her dead. Tokyo
radio claimed victory in the battle for Saipan, stating that they
had sunk a battleship which they identified as &quot;probably the
New Jersey.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The
&quot;sunken&quot; TENNESSEE returned to Saipan Channel early the
next day. Several Japanese counterattacks had been stopped during
the night, and TENNESSEE's supporting fire assisted the marines
in organizing and consolidating their beachhead. During the
evening, the first troops of the Army's 27th Infantry Division
began to come ashore; another counterattack, this one involving
tanks, was turned back during the night of 16 and 17 June.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The original plan
laid called for landings on Guam on the 18th. However, during the
afternoon of the 16th and the early hours of the 16th, Admiral
Spruance was advised that Japanese warships were at sea, off the
Philippines, heading for the Marianas. The Japanese plan for the
defense of these vital islands called for their garrison to hold
out while a naval force mounted a counterstroke to destroy the
American invasion fleet. By the morning of the 16th, Spruance
decided to cancel the attack on Guam while continuing the fight
for Saipan and disposing his naval forces for battle. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The fast carrier
force was sent to counter the Japanese thrust, while the
fire-support battleships were to be deployed to the west of
Saipan in case the Japanese should evade Task Force 58 and direct
a surface thrust at the island. TENNESSEE held station west of
Saipan with the other elderly battleships as the two fleets
groped toward each other about 150 miles away.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On the 19th,
Mitscher's task force clashed with Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa's
Mobile Fleet in what was to be called the &quot;Great Marianas
Turkey Shoot.&quot; By this time, American carrier operations had
attained a high level of excellence while the Japanese air arm,
its experienced airmen mostly lost during the long campaigns of
1942 and 1943, had to make do with unskilled pilots. The result
was striking. In more than eight hours of intense aerial combat,
more than 300 Japanese planes were knocked down, most of these by
carrier fighters. By the 20th, counterattacking American planes
and submarines had sent carriers HIYO, SHOKAKU, and TAIHO to the
bottom. Thus, Japan's last serious carrier offensive operation
ended in disaster.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Ozawa's fleet
never got close enough to Saipan for TENNESSEE and her cousins to
be called upon. On the 20th, she fueled east of Saipan as the
Japanese carrier force headed westward. The next day, she was
back on the gun line to blast gun positions on Manigassa Island,
off Tanapag harbor. Call fire occupied the afternoon, as she took
on several targets near Garapan. TENNESSEE's 14-inch guns
commenced firing at 0555 the next day, pounding Garapan from
6,000 yards. Shell hits on the battered town raised clouds of
smoke and dust, reminding the battleship's gunners of the
Aleutian murk. Fire was shifted onto Mount Tapotchau, east of
Garapan, before being returned to Garapan to assist the American
troops who were working their way into the southern part of town.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On the night of 22
June, TENNESSEE got underway for Eniwetok where HECTOR (AR-7)
repaired her battle damage as the fight for Saipan ground to its
end on 9 July. Her next destination was Guam. Departing Eniwetok
on 16 July with CALIFORNIA, she joined Rear Admiral Ainsworth's
Southern Fire Support Group (TG 53.5) off Guam in the afternoon
of the 19th. The next day, she joined in a systematic bombardment
begun on the 8th which was carefully planned to soften up the
enemy's defenses while avoiding harm to the island's friendly
Chamorro population. TENNESSEE launched her planes; and, at 0742,
her turret guns opened fire while the 5-inch battery raked nearby
Cabras Island. The ship slowly maneuvered to a position north of
Asan Point, several miles north of Apra harbor, where one of two
landing beaches was sited. UDT's scouted the beaches while planes
laid smoke screens to cover their movements, and the ships' guns
kept the Japanese defenders occupied. Firing ceased at midday and
resumed late in the afternoon, as TENNESSEE continued to hammer
Japanese positions north of Apra.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Shortly after dawn
on 21 July, the bombardment ships again took up their work.
TENNESSEE renewed her attentions to Cabras Island as the assault
waves formed and headed for shore and continued to provide
support during the first stage of the landing. At 1003, she
ceased firing. Late that day, she put to sea with CALIFORNIA and
COLORADO and returned to Saipan on 22 July.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE anchored
in Tanapag harbor to replenish ammunition before taking up her
night position to the west of Tinian. At 0607 on 23 July, she
opened fire on the waterfront area of Tinian Town, as part of a
deception scheme intended to convince the strong Japanese
garrison that the landing would take place at Sunharon Bay, on
the southwest coast of the island. A UDT even made a daylight
reconnaissance of the beaches to strengthen the impression, and
TENNESSEE's guns supported the frogmen. Fire paused around midday
and resumed again in the afternoon before the ship retired to her
night position off the island.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Early in the
morning of the 24th, TENNESSEE took up her position off Tinian's
northwest coast with CALIFORNIA, LOUISVILLE (CA28), and several
destroyers. From 2,500 yards offshore, the ships opened fire at
0532 ceasing fire as the first wave closed the beach at 0747. For
the rest of the day, the ship stood by to deliver fire if needed,
then retired for the night. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In the morning of
26 July, TENNESSEE relieved CALIFORNIA as the &quot;duty ship
&quot; to furnish call fire upon request from the beach. Through
the 25th and 26th, TENNESSEE delivered supporting fire by day and
star shell by night. After returning briefly to Saipan to
replenish on the 27th, the battleship was back on the firing line
on the 28th, and her fire supported the advancing marines through
the afternoon. Following replenishment at Saipan on the 29th,
TENNESSEE began the 30th in support of marines advancing
southward through Tinian Town. In the early morning, one of her
observation planes collided in midair with a landbased marine
OY-I spotting plane. Both aircraft plummeted to earth behind
Japanese lines and burst into flames; the crews of both were
killed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Firing continued
through that day and into the 31st, as the marines crowded the
last defenders into the southern tip of: the island. At 0830 on
31 July, TENNESSEE's guns fell silent, and she returned to Saipan
with her task accomplished. On the evening of 2 August, she
arrived off Guam to resume fire-support duty. Rejoining
Ainsworth's gunfire task group, she delivered call fire and
illumination until 8 August when she joined CALIFORNIA and
LOUISVILLE for the voyage to Eniwetok and thence to Espiritu
Santo in the New Hebrides. The ships arrived at Espiritu Santo on
24 August. On 2 September, TENNESSEE arrived at Tulagi for a
brief period of amphibious support training.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Meanwhile,
decisions had been made which would reshape the Allied offensive
in the western Pacific. Meeting at Pearl Harbor in July 1944,
President Roosevelt Admiral Nimitz, and General MacArthur had
finally reached an agreement that the Philippines were to be
liberated, not merely bypassed. After further discussions, the
Joint Chiefs of Staff approved landings beginning at Mindanao,
continuing north through Leyte, then taking either Luzon or
Formosa and Amoy. During early September, Task Force 38 hit
Japanese bases from the Palaus to the Visayas, inflicting
considerable damage. Surprisingly little resistance was
encountered by the roving carriers, leading to a conclusion that
enemy air strength was virtually nonexistent. Nimitz, MacArthur,
and Halsey agreed that this eliminated any need for a network of
southern air bases to support the capture of the Philippines.
Proposed landings on Yap and Mindanao were scrapped, although
Morotai was invaded in September and preparations were made for
an assault on the Palaus before bypassing the southern
Philippines and going into Leyte.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The Palaus were to
be TENNESSEE's next objective. This group is not an atoll, but an
elongated cluster of islands just north of the Equator and at the
western end of the Carolines. The group is about 110 miles long
from small islands and reefs to the north through the large
island of Babelthuap to the small southern islands of Peleliu and
Angaur.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The objectives of
the assault force were Kossol Roads, a reefsheltered anchorage at
the northern end of the chain, and the two southern islands; the
large Japanese garrison on Babelthuap was to be isolated and left
to its own devices. Planes and gunfire ships took turns pounding
Peleliu from the morning of 12 September until the assault waves
went ashore on the 15th. The battle for that island was to be one
of the most bitter of the Pacific war, and organized resistance
was not eliminated until November, at a heavy cost in lives.
TENNESSEE's target was the smaller island of Angaur, a few miles
south of Peleliu. On the morning of 12 September, TENNESSEE and
PENNSYLVANIA, with four light cruisers and five destroyers, began
a prolonged bombardment as carrier aircraft did their share.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The flash and roar
of bombs and gunfire from ships and planes attacking Peleliu were
plain on the horizon as TENNESSEE closed Angaur early on 12
September. The battleship opened fire at 0682, hurling 14-inch
shells at targets ashore from 14,000 yards. Through the morning
and afternoon, her guns hit coastdefense positions and
antiaircraft sites. During the afternoon, minesweepers cleared
the approaches to the beaches. By this time, TENNESSEE was only
8,760 yards from shore, and her 40millimeters had joined in. A
prominent masonry lighthouse on the west coast of Angaur was
ordered destroyed to keep the Japanese from using it as a gunfire
observation point. Twelve 14-inch rounds were aimed at it,
scarring the area and scoring three hits, but the tower remained
standing. Other targets absorbed TENNESSEE's attention for the
next three days. TENNESSEE stood by off Peleliu during the
morning of the 15th in case her guns should be needed to assist
the assault landing. When this work was completed, she returned
on the evening of 16 September to finish off the stubborn tower
before the next morning's scheduled landings. As the ship's
turret guns trained out on the target, a 6-inch projectile from
DENVER (CL-58) screamed in from the far side of the island and
sent the lighthouse crashing down in a cloud of smoke and dust.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Ships and carrier
planes pounded the island for five days before Army troops of the
81st Infantry Division went ashore on Angaur on the morning of 17
September. TENNESSEE's guns supported the soldiers through the
19th. By the morning of 20 September, organized resistance was at
an end; and the battleship steamed away from the island to Kossol
Roads to refuel and to take on ammunition. On 28 September, she
arrived at Manus to prepare for her next operation.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE weighed
anchor on 12 October and set her course for Leyte Gulf, Under the
supreme command of General MacArthur, Vice Admiral Thomas
Kinkaid's 7th Fleet carried two Army corps toward the invasion
area. Their objectives were two landing zones on the eastern
coast of Leyte. A Northern Attack Force (TF 78) under Rear
Admiral Daniel Barbey was aimed at Tacloban, while Vice Admiral
Theodore Wilson command TF 79, the Southern Attack Force whose
target was Dulag. The old battleships were divided between two
fire-support units. TENNESSEE, with CALIFORNIA and PENNSYLVANIA,
sailed with the Dulag attack force under Rear Admiral Oldendorf.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">During its
approach to the Philippines, the invasion force was alert for air
and submarine attack; but none came. As the ships steamed under
hot, clear skies, their radios brought news of Task Force 38 as
the fast carriers ranged an arc from the Ryukyus to Formosa
before turning on Japanese air bases in Luzon and the central
Philippines. Preliminary minesweeping and bombardment, to clear
the way into Leyte Gulf, began on the morning of 17 October 1944.
The entrance to the gulf was secured, but the approaches to the
objective area were partially swept when Oldendorf, to avoid
delaying the operation, decided to order his ships into the gulf.
At 0609 on the morning of the 18th, TENNESSEE, with her
fire-support unit, entered the channel between Homonhon and
Dinagat islands. Paravanes streamed from her bows, and marines
were stationed in her upperworks to sink or explode floating
mines. The minesweepers continued their work as the heavy ships
moved slowly up Leyte Gulf.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE took up
her position off Dulag before dawn on 19 October and, at 0645,
began to bombard the landing area north of the town. Her main
battery opened up from 8,300 yards, and her secondaries chimed in
a few minutes later as she aimed at fortifications and
antiaircraft gun emplacements. Catmon Hill, a 1,000-foot
elevation just inland, received particular attention from the
ships. Japanese planes were reported in the offing, but the only
attack came from a horizontal bomber which dropped one bomb into
the water near HONOLULU (CL-48) before being knocked down by
gunfire. Heavy shelling continued through the afternoon, and the
bombardment ships took up night cruising stations off the mouth
of Leyte Gulf.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The landings were
scheduled for 20 October; and at 0600 TENNESSEE opened
neutralization fire on the beaches. As the northern force pounded
Tacloban and went in to the attack, transports assembled off
Dulag and put the landing force into the water. Infantry landing
craft armed with heavy mortars (LCI(M)) began dropping shells on
reverse slopes at 0915; and, at 0930, the landing waves crossed
the line of departure and moved for the beach. At 0945,
rocket-firing landing craft (LCI(R)) began to hurl their masses
of explosive bombardment rockets at the beach defenses, and the
first troops went ashore 15 minutes later. Naval gunfire was
shifted inland and to the flanks to assist the landing troops as
they began to carve out a beachhead. The landing went well.
During the afternoon, HONOLULU was again attacked, this time by a
torpedo bomber which scored a hit and forced the cruiser to
withdraw. Night air attacks were feared; a screen of destroyers
was placed around the ships in the gulf, smoke was generated, and
much nervous firing flared up in the darkness and caused some
casualties.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The Japanese
Imperial General Headquarters, on noting the scale of the
operation being mounted against Leyte, had decided to make that
island the focus of a decisive naval counterstroke. The principal
surface strength of the Combined Fleet had gone to Lingga Roads,
an anchorage in the Lingga Archipelago off Sumatra at the
southwest end of the South China Sea, to be near their fuel
supply since American submarines had made it increasingly
difficult to get oil through to Japan. The surviving carriers had
returned to the Inland Sea to train aircrews. Under the Japanese
plan, dictated by a combination of geography, logistics, and the
lack of adequate carrier aviation, four widely separated forces
were to converge on the area of Leyte Gulf in an effort to
destroy, at whatever cost, the American invasion force.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">While the Japanese
fleet set out for Leyte, TENNESSEE continued her work off the
beachhead. Fire support was not required from her for the time
being, but the increasing tempo of Japanese air activity in the
area required her to place herself where her antiaircraft guns
could assist in the defense of the assembled transports and cargo
ships. In the evening of 21 October, while lying dead in the
water in a smoke screen laid to protect the shipping from
attacking planes, TENNESSEE was rammed near the stern by the
transport WAR HAWK (AP-168). No one was injured, and the
battleship's tough hull was little harmed, but her orders for a
night fire-support mission were canceled.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Matters continued
to go well ashore, where the town of Tacloban was captured and
declared a temporary seat of the Philippine government. Air
defense, rather than shore bombardment, was still TENNESSEE's
mission; on the morning of the 24th, enemy planes sank an LCI(L)
and damaged a cargo ship before being driven off. A larger raid
came in from several directions before noon, hitting American
positions on Leyte. The afternoon was mostly quiet. A third
attack occurred at 1700. As the enemy aircraft drew away, the
battleship's executive officer passed the electrifying word that
a Japanese naval task force was expected to try to enter Leyte
Gulf that night. The six old battleships of the fire support
groups formed columns and moved south to take up positions at the
mouth of Surigao Strait, the body of water between Leyte and
Dinagat which formed a southern entrance to Leyte Gulf.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The Japanese
forces set in motion some days earlier were now approaching their
objective. A force of four carriers and two converted
hermaphrodite &quot;battleship-carriers&quot; was steaming south
from Japan toward the Philippine Sea, while a small surface force
under Admiral Shima had sailed from Japanese waters heading for
the Sulu Sea. Two striking forces of battleships, cruisers, and
destroyers had sailed from Lingga Roads; north of Borneo they
separated. The larger force, under Admiral Kurita, passed north
of Palawan (losing three cruisers to submarine attack) to transit
the Sibuyan Sea and emerge to the north of Samar. A smaller
force, commanded by Admiral Nishimura, turned to the south of
Palawan and crossed the Sulu Sea to pass between Mindanao and
Leyte. Shima's orders directed him to support Nishimura, and his
force followed some miles behind Nishimura's.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">If the Sho plan,
as it was called, worked properly, Kurita would approach Leyte
Gulf from the north while Nishimura and Shima came up from the
south, catching the massed amphibious shipping in the jaws of a
vise and destroying it. Ozawa's force was toothless since
prolonged heavy casualties and an inadequate pilot training
program had left the Imperial Navy with few experienced carrier
pilots. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The carrier force
advancing southward from Japan carried only enough planes to make
a convincing decoy; its job was to lure Halsey's 3d Fleet to the
north while the converging surface forces did their job.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">During the morning
of 24 October, carrier planes sighted the three Japanese groups
in the Sulu and Sibuyan seas. Recognizing Kurita's as the most
powerful, Halsey directed the fast carriers' air groups against
him as the Japanese ships steamed across the Sibuyan Sea. With no
air cover, Kurita had to endure repeated bomb and torpedo attacks
which forced one of his cruisers to turn back with serious damage
and, as the day ended, sank the giant battleship MUSASHI.
Complaining of the lack of air support, Kurita turned back in
midafternoon; and this movement was reported to Halsey by his
pilots.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Early on the 24th,
a Japanese scout plane from Luzon had spotted Task Force 38 east
of that island. All available landbased planes were sent against
it, mortally wounding the light carrier PRINCETON (CVL-23 ).
Halsey concluded that the attackers were carrier-based. During
the morning, Ozawa's reconnaissance planes sighted Halsey's
carriers; and an unproductive air strike was launched against
Task Force 38 at 1145. In the afternoon, the Japanese carriers
were sighted and, in the evening of 24 October, Halsey ordered
the fast carrier force to go after them. Shortly before sunset,
Kurita had again reversed course and was heading back in the
direction of Leyte Gulf; Halsey had been informed of this, but
exaggerated reports of damage inflicted by his planes led him to
believe that the Japanese force had been more grievously hurt
than was the case. Judging that Kurita was too badly crippled to
do an harm to the ships in Leyte Gulf, Halsey continued north
through the night. By midnight the Japanese Center Force, as the
American commanders referred to it was pushing, unobserved,
toward San Bernardino Strait before turning south toward Leyte
Gulf.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Halsey had not
sent his planes against the surface forces of Nishimura and
Shima, believing that Kinkaid's warships would be able to deal
with them. This was to be Oldendorf's job; and, in the evening of
the 24th, he deployed his six battleships across the northern end
of Surigao Strait. Besides his capital ships, Oldendorf had
available eight cruisers and 28 destroyers. These were arranged
toward the flanks, the destroyers placed in suitable position to
launch torpedo attacks. A great deal of shooting in support of
the landing operation had already occurred, and most of the
shells remaining in the battleship's magazines were thin-walled,
high-capacity bombardment ammunition rather than armor-piercing
projectiles. Their handling-room crews carefully arranged the
projectile supply so that high-capacity shells would be ready for
use against anything smaller than a battleship. The big ships
were directed to hold their fire until the enemy was within
20,000 yards to insure as many hits as possible.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The sea was smooth
and the moonless night intensely dark as the ships steamed slowly
to and fro along their assigned lines of position. TENNESSEE
quietly awaited her first action against her own kind.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">All available 7th
Fleet PT boats had been stationed in Surigao Strait and along its
approaches. At 2286, the first PT's made radar contact with
Nishimura. Successive torpedo attacks were launched as Nishimura
entered Surigao Strait and steamed north, with Shima trailing
well behind; Nishimura was annoyed but not injured, though one of
Shima's cruisers took a torpedo and had to drop out of the
running. Shortly before 0800, Nishimura was well into the strait
and taking up battle formation when he was hit by a well-planned
torpedo attack by five American destroyers. The battleship FUSO
was hit and dropped out of formation; other torpedo spreads sank
two Japanese destroyers and crippled a third. Another torpedo
struck, but did not stop, FUSO's sistership YAMASHIRO. Ten
minutes later, another destroyer attack scored a second hit on
YAMASHIRO The disabled FUSO had apparently been set afire by the
torpedo that had hit her; her magazines exploded at 0888 as
ARIZONA's had on the morning of 7 December; and the two shattered
halves of the battleship slowly drifted back down the strait
before sinking.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On board
TENNESSEE, observers had seen distant flashes of gunfire, star
shells, and searchlights as the torpedo boats and destroyers
engaged the Japanese. Soon explosions could be heard. At 0302,
the battleship's radar picked up Nishimura'a approach at nearly
44,000 yards and began to track the lead ship. This was the
flagship, YAMASHIRO. With the cruiser MOGAMI and destroyer
SHIGURE, she was all that remained of the first Japanese force.
At 0351 Oldendorf ordered the flanking cruisers to open fire;
and, at 0356, the battleships let fly from 20,600 yards.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE's
forward turret fired a three-gun salvo, and the rest of her
14-inch battery joined in. In this duel, TENNESSEE, CALIFORNIA,
and the recently arrived WEST VIRGINIA had a considerable
advantage over the other battleships. During their wartime
modernization, all three had received new Mark 34 mainbattery
directors provided with Mark 8 fire-control radars and associated
modern gunfire computing equipment. The main batteries of the
other ships were still controlled by systems developed 20 years
or more before and were using earlier Mark 3 radars. This
handicap showed in their shooting. Firing in sixgun salvos to
make careful use of her limited supply of armorpiercing
projectiles, TENNESSEE got off 69 of her big 14-inch bullets
before checking fire at 0408. The battle line had increased speed
to 16 knots before opening fire, and, as it drew near the eastern
end of its line of position, simultaneous turns brought the ships
around to a westward heading. CALIFORNIA miscalculated her turn
and came sharply across TENNESSEE's bow, narrowly avoiding a
collision and fouling TENNESSEE's line of fire for about five
minutes.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The effect of this
intense bombardment was awesome. As one of TENNESSEE's crew
described it, &quot;when a ship fired there would be a terrific
whirling sheet of golden flame bolting across the sea, followed
by a massive thunder, and then three red balls would go into the
sky; up, arch-over, and then down. When the salvoes found the
target there would be a huge shower of sparks, and after a moment
a dull orange glow would appear. This low would increase,
brighten, and then slowly dull.&quot; Little of the enemy could
be seen from TENNESSEE. Occasionally, the vague outline of a ship
could be seen against the glare of an explosion; and, at one
point, the single stack and high &quot;pagoda&quot; foremast of
YAMASHIRO could be seen. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Nishimura's three
ships found themselves at the focus of a massive crossfire of
battleship and cruiser fire. By 0400, both of the larger Japanese
ships had been hit repeatedly as they gallantly attempted to
return fire; MOGAMI, sorely damaged and her engineering plant
crippled, had turned back, and YAMASHIRO, burning intensely, came
about to follow. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Oldendorf ordered
gunfire to cease at 0409, after hearing that flanking destroyers
were being endangered by American gunfire. YAMASHIRO, still able
to make 16 knots after her frightful beating, was fatally hurt
and, at 0419, rolled over and sank with all but a few of her
crew. MOGAMI was able to draw out of radar range but had been
slowed to a crawl. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">SHIGURE, more or
less over-looked and relatively undamaged, escaped southward.
[SHIGURE's career in W.W.II is replete with such battles and
survivals as this. LWJ]</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Shima's force,
following along in Nishimura's wake, was unaware of what had
befallen. When they were about halfway up Surigao Strait, they
sighted what seemed to be two flaming ships; these were the
broken halves of FUSO. Shima's two cruisers made a radar torpedo
attack on what they believed to be American ships but was, in
fact, Hibuson Island. &quot;The island,&quot; as Samuel E.
Morison remarked, &quot;was not damaged.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The Japanese
admiral decided that Nishimura's force had met with disaster and
decided on a retreat. As his ships turned to steam back, cruiser
NACHI collided with limping, burning MOGAMI, but both vessels
were able to continue southward. Collecting SHIGURE, the only
other survivor of Nishimura's attack, Shima retired back through
the strait. Oldendorf sent some of his cruisers and destroyers
after him, and the patrolling PT's joined in. Fire was engaged
with the stubborn MOGAMI, but she continued on her way only to be
sunk by carrier planes shortly afterward. Destroyer ASAGUMO, her
bow blown off by destroyer torpedoes during Nishimura's approach,
was sighted and sent to the bottom with her guns still firing. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Oldendorf now
received reports that Kurita's &quot;crippled&quot; force had
emerged from San Bernardino Strait and joined action east of
Samar with some of the supporting escort carrier force stationed
there. Plans were hurriedly drawn for another surface battle, and
Oldendorf's ships turned toward the northern entrance to Leyte
Gulf to defend the landing area.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Their services
were, however, not needed. In an epic action off Samar, the
escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts of Rear
Admiral C. A. F. Sprague's &quot;Taffy Three&quot; put up so
desperate a fight that Kurita judged the odds against him
hopeless and turned back. Halsey's carrier planes and surface
ships sank all four of Ozawa's decoy carriers, and a submarine
finished off a damaged cruiser.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The Battle for
Leyte Gulf was over. The last major Japanese naval counterstroke
had been defeated, and TENNESSEE had had a share in the last
naval action fought by a battle line.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The next several
days were quiet ones for TENNESSEE, though the Japanese sent
numerous land-based air strikes against Leyte Gulf. On 29
October, the battlewagon's crew was told that their next
destination was to be the Puget Sound Navy Yard. Late that day,
she got underway for Ulithi with WEST VIRGINIA, MARYLAND, and
four cruisers. From there, she proceeded to Pearl Harbor and
thence to Bremerton where she entered the shipyard on 26
November.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Unlike her last
Yard overhaul, this refit made no remarkable changes in
TENNESSEE's appearance. She retained her battery of 10
40-millimeter quadruple anti-aircraft mounts and 43 20millimeter
guns, but her main-battery directors received improved models of
the Mark 8 radar, and the Mark 4 radars used with the 5-inch gun
directors were replaced by the newer combination of paired Mark
12 and Mark 22 dual-purpose equipment. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE's
usefulness as an anti-aircraft ship was enhanced by the addition
of a model SP height-finding radar. Her pattern camouflage scheme
was replaced by a dark gray finish which was calculated to
provide a less conspicuous aiming point for kamikaze suicide
planes, introduced during the recapture of the Philippines and
becoming more and more of a fact of naval life during the winter
of 1944 and 1945.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 2 February
1945, TENNESSEE headed back toward the western Pacific. While she
was being refitted, landings had been made in the Central
Philippines and on Luzon; and the liberation of the Philippines
was nearly accomplished. From its base in the Marianas, the 20th
Army Air Force was hitting Japan with B-29s. Their track led past
the Bonin Islands, whose garrison could send an early warning to
Japanese airfields and gunners in the home islands. To eliminate
this danger, provide an advanced base for fighter escorts, and
obtain an emergency landing field for damaged bombers, Nimitz had
been directed to capture Iwo Jima before going on to the Ryukyus
to seize Okinawa as an advanced base for the assault on Japan
proper. Japanese resistance on Leyte delayed the landing on Luzon
from 20 December 1944 to 9 January 1945, while the landing in the
Bonins, scheduled for 20 January 1945, had to be deferred until
19 February. The schedule for landings in the new year was tight;
but planners deemed it essential to move as expeditiously as
possible since the invasion of southern Japan, scheduled for the
fall, depended on the use of Iwo Jima and Okinawa as bases for a
long and intensive aerial bombardment.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The Japanese had
predicted that a landing would be made on Iwo Jima, and a large
garrison of good troops under Lieutenant General Tadanichi
Kuribayashi had done a thorough job of digging themselves in. The
volcanic island's rugged terrain was heavily fortified with
strongly built firing positions supported by a deep and intricate
network of tunnels.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">B-24 Liberators of
the 7th Army Air Force bombed Iwo Jima for 74 consecutive days to
soften it up for an assault, and five naval bombardments were
delivered. This pounding had no significant effect except to
accelerate the work of the defenders.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Steaming by way of
Pearl Harbor and Saipan, TENNESSEE was just in time to join Rear
Admiral W. H. P. Blandy's bombardment force. Blandy, an ordnance
specialist, had been Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance earlier in
the war. With the expert help of Lt. Col. Donald Weller, USMC,
the preinvasion bombardment was thoroughly planned and was
modified to meet immediate needs as the shelling progressed. The
Japanese defensive tactic called for the landing troops to be
stopped on the beaches before they could move inland, and a heavy
belt of defenses extended along the shoreline. The mission of the
bombarding ships and planes was to break down the Japanese cordon
and permit the landing marines to push through before they could
be cut to pieces.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Blandy's gunfire
force arrived off Iwo Jima early on 16 February 1945. The morning
was cool, with occasional rain squalls, and low cloud cover
hindered spotting planes. Shortly after daybreak, the warships
deployed to their stations, with escort carriers in the near
distance providing air cover. Minesweepers began to clear the
approaches to the island at 0645, and gunfire opened at 0707.
TENNESSEE's assigned firing course took her along the
southeastern shore of Iwo Jima, and her 14-inch guns struck the
slopes of Mount Suribachi while the secondaries aimed at the high
ground at the north end of the beach. Floatplanes and fighters
observing gunfire over the island were followed by dark puffs of
antiaircraft fire. Blandy ordered the ships to fire only when air
spot could function effectively in the intermittent visibility .
Whenever the airplanes could observe the results, the ships kept
their fire up through the day. During the afternoon, an OB2U
Kingfisher seaplane from the cruiser Pensacola (CA-24) found a
Japanese &quot;Zeke&quot; on its tail. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The observation
pilot, determined to put up all the fight he could, went at the
fighter though his plane was much slower and less maneuverable,
and armed only with one .30-caliber forwardFiring machine gun
plus a second flexible gun in the observer's cockpit. Against all
the odds, the &quot;Zeke&quot; went down in flames.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Visibility was
better the next day, and the ships began to approach beaches at
0803. Beginning at 10,000 yards, TENNESSEE, with IDAHO and
NEVADA, soon closed to 3,000 yards and delivered heavy direct
fire to assigned targets while assault minesweeping went on. At
1025, the battleships were ordered to retire to make way for
UDT's supported by LCI(G)'s. The defenders concluded that this
was the beginning of the actual landing and unmasked guns and
mortars in a heavy fire on the gunboats and frogmen. Casualties
mounted; one gunboat was sunk another set afire. The other LCI's
returned fire but had to withdraw as the bombardment ships
resumed firing against the defenses. Three damaged gunboats came
alongside TENNESSEE to transfer their wounded to the battleship's
sick bay.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Bombardment
continued through the 18th under orders prescribing concentrated
hammering of the landing beaches. Once more, TENNESSEE's big guns
pounded Suribachi while her secondaries attacked gun positions
overlooking the right flank of the objective area. While the
heavier guns fired from ranges varying between 2,200 and 6,000
yards, the 40-millimeter battery raked other targets on cliffs at
the north end of the beach and shot up the wrecks of several
Japanese ships beached near the shore; these had been used as
havens for snipers and machine gunners at Tarawa and in later
landings, and were always treated as potential threats. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Several fires were
started ashore; an ammunition dump exploded spectacularly and
burned for several hours. Coastal guns and antiaircraft weapons
were still firing when TENNESSEE retired for the night, even
though she and IDAHO had been able to demolish many massive
masonry pillboxes with direct hits.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Vice Admiral
Richmond K. Turner arrived off Iwo Jima at 0600 on the morning of
19 February with the main body of the invasion force and assumed
command. Transports formed up in the darkness and, at daybreak,
put their landing craft into the water as troops clambered down
the ship's cargo nets. The loaded landing craft circled near the
transports as they awaited the signal to land. Tank landing ships
moved closer to shore, opened their bow doors and launched LVT's
carrying the first wave of assault troops. Shortly after
daylight, a heavy bombardment was opened by the ships of Task
Force 54 reinforced by the newer battleships NORTH CAROLINA
(BB-55), WASHINGTON (BB-56), and three cruisers lent for the
occasion by Task Force 58. A total of seven battleships, four
8-inch gun heavy cruisers, and three light cruisers armed with
6-inchers laid their fire on the landing areas. At first, the
fire was slow and deliberate. It was checked for an air strike,
as lanes from the fast carrier force delivered bombs, rockets,
and napalm before the ships resumed a heavier fire. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Beginning at 0850,
fire was so adjusted that carrier fighters could strafe the
beaches during the last few minutes before H-hour. One minute
before H-hour, the turret guns ceased firing, and the secondary
guns began to drop a rolling barrage just ahead of the marines as
they landed and moved inland, shore fire control parties (SFCP)
accompanied the marines ashore; one SFCP was assigned to work
with each of the supporting battleships and cruisers.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The first wave
crossed the line of departure at 0830 and landed only a fraction
before the scheduled 0900 H-hour. As the troops landed, the
Japanese, who had waited out the bombardment in their deep
tunnels, manned guns and mortars in protected emplacement and
opened an increasingly heavy fire. The ships' guns were kept
busy; main batteries took on gun positions as they were located
while the lighter guns kept up their barrage ahead of the men on
the ground. TENNESSEE's station was 8,000 yards from Suribachi at
the southern end of the landing area, and the water and her was
churned by hundreds of vehicles and landing craft as the
successive waves moved in. By the end of the day, some 30,000
marines were on Iwo Jima, and some tanks and artillery had been
landed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Ground fighting on
Iwo Jima continued until 26 March, as the stubborn Japanese were
slowly rooted out or the positions that they continued to defend
to the last. Even before the struggle ended, though, Army
engineers had patched up the island's battered airstrip; and
damaged B-29s were able to seek refuge on dry land instead of
ditching. TENNESSEE was a part of this struggle until 7 March,
when she sailed for Ulithi. The days after the landing were a
steady routine of call fire and counterbattery work as Japanese
guns continued to reveal themselves by opening fire on the
hovering support ships before being located and taken out. For
this purpose, it had been found that single-gun salvoes at close
range, using &quot;pointer fire&quot; (in which the gun is
directly aimed by telescopic sight), were the most precise and
effective. The notion of using a 14-inch naval gun for sniping
was rather new, but it seemed to work very well.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE left the
area having deposited 1,370 rounds of mainbattery fire on Iwo
Jima along with 6,380 5-inch and 11,481 40millimeter projectiles.
At Ulithi, she began to prepare for the Okinawa operation.
Supplies and ammunition were loaded, and the tired sailors
stretched their legs and drank beer on tiny Mog Mog Island, whose
principal selling point as a vacation resort seemed to be that it
did not move underfoot.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Everyone involved
knew that this job would be attended by special hazards.
Censorship had prevented any mention of the Japanese kamikaze
weapon in the American press, but it was much in the mind of the
Fleet. Admiral Oldendorf, injured and hospitalized shortly after
reaching Ulithi, was replaced by Rear Admiral Morton Deyo, who
broke his flag in TENNESSEE on 15 March On the 21st, Task Force
54, the gunfire force, was underway for the Ryukyus. As Kerama
Retto, a small cluster of islands near Okinawa was taken for use
as an advanced base, the battleships arrived off the main island.
With TENNESSEE were COLORADO, MARYLAND, WEST VIRGINIA, NEW
MEXICO, and IDAHO, as well as NEVADA, NEW YORK, TEXAS, and the
venerable Arkansas (BB-33), first commissioned in 1912 and still
pulling her weight; she was the only battleship in the fleet
still armed with 12-inch guns. With the capital ships came 10
cruisers, 32 destroyer and destroyer escorts, and numerous gun-
and rocket-firing LCI's and LSM's.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Shortly after
midnight on 26 March 1945, Task Force 54 approached Okinawa with
its crews at general quarters in the darkness. At daylight, it
deployed; the bombardment began at long range since the nearer
waters had not yet been swept for mines. The minesweepers began
to work as the ships fired on targets located by previous aerial
reconnaissance. No enemy fire answered the American guns though
antiaircraft shells pecked at spotting planes. Japanese
submarines were in the area, and a number of ships sighted
torpedo wakes, but no damage resulted. Planes from the escort
carriers and from Task Force 58 mounted strikes on the island,
took detailed photographs, and flew air cover for the surface
ships. The need for this became quite evident early on the next
morning, when a number of kamikazes came in at a time when no
combat air patrol (CAP) was overhead. One suicider hit NEVADA,
knocking out one of her turrets; another damaged BILOXI (CL-80)
at the waterline, while a third went into the water to port of
TENNESSEE. The converted &quot;flushdecker&quot; DORSEY (DMS-1)
was hit by a kamikaze which glanced off the ship, damaging, but
not crippling, her.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">This was to be the
pattern of life off Okinawa during the grueling weeks to come, as
the &quot;fleet that came to stay&quot; battled to see the land
battle through while keeping itself alive. Long hours at general
quarters kept all hands tense and tired as the ships prowled off
the island Firing at every likely target while reports of suicide
attacks piled up.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The day of the
Landing-1 April 1945, Easter Sunday-was bright and fair, with a
gentle breeze. At 0600, Admiral Turner assumed overall command of
the operation as Deyo continued to direct the gunfire ships.
After a morning bombardment which Morison described as &quot;the
most impressive gunfire support that any assault troops had ever
had,&quot; the landing began. H-Hour was 0830, preceded by the
by-now customary intense battering by everything from battleships
and carrier planes to sheaves of rockets from flat-bottomed
landing craft. As the troops hit the beach, the bombardment was
lifted. Early progress was good, meeting surprisingly light
opposition. Veterans of earlier landings, and even the
intelligence staffs, were puzzled at not having to fight the
usual savage struggle to get ashore. Lieutenant General Mitsuru
Ushijima, commanding nearly 100,000 defenders-three-quarters of
whom were regular Army troops-had decided to make no attempt to
stop the landing at the beaches. Instead, he dug his main
strength into the hilly southern end of Okinawa, thoroughly
fortified as Iwo Jima had been but on a much larger scale.
Japanese artillery held its fire during the prelanding
bombardment so that their positions would not be given away;
instead of dueling with the ships they would save their fire for
the landing troops. His general idea was to pin down the invasion
force and delay it as long as possible, while a massive suicide
air offensive wore down the supporting naval forces.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">By 18 April, all
of northern and central Okinawa was in American hands. The long
fight for the Japanese citadel around the old island capital of
Naha was to last much longer, and the island was not secured
until 21 June. In the meanwhile, the Navy battled by day and
night against the unremitting kamikaze offensive. On the
afternoon of 12 April, TENNESSEE instead of taking up a
fire-support station-was steaming in air-defense formation, Deyo
had been warned that a heavy air attack was on the way and,
during the afternoon, it arrived. Some suiciders were knocked
down by picket destroyers or splashed by CAP; others, though, got
through and aimed themselves at the firing, maneuvering ships.
More bandits were shot down by antiaircraft fire, but ZELLARS
(DD-777) was set ablaze by a crashing plane. Five more picked
TENNESSEE and came in through puffs of shell bursts and the heavy
smoke from ZELLARS. Four were shot down, the last three only
hundreds of yards from the battleship. The last diver came down
on the bow at a 45-degree angle, was set aflame by 5-inch fire,
and plunged into the water. At the same time, an Aichi A6M
&quot;Val&quot; divebomber, flying low on the starboard bow,
headed directly for TENNESSEE's bridge. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Lookouts spotted
the &quot;Val&quot; at 2,500 yards, and every automatic weapon
that could bear opened up. One of the plane's fixed wheels was
torn off, and its engine began to smoke. Heading at first for
TENNESSEE's tower foremast, the Japanese pilot swerved slightly
and crashed into the signal bridge. The burning wreck slid aft
along the superstructure, crushing antiaircraft guns and their
crews, and stopped next to Turret Three. It had carried a
250-pound bomb which, with what was left of the plane, went
through the wooden deck and exploded. Twenty-two men were killed
or fatally wounded, with another 107 injured.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">This was not
enough to put TENNESSEE out of action. The dead were buried at
sea, and the wounded transferred the following day to the
casualty-evacuation transport PINKNEY ( APH-2 ). The ship's
company turned to on emergency repairs; and, by 14 April, the
ship was back on the firing line. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE remained
off Okinawa for two more weeks. On 1 May, Admiral Deyo shifted
his flag to a cruiser, and TENNESSEE set her course for Ulithi.
Here, the repair ship AJAX (AR-6) made repairs, cutting away
damaged plating and installing new guns to replace those lost. On
3 June, the ship sailed for Okinawa, arriving on the 9th. By now,
the worst was over. Army troops were making a final drive to
clear the island, and TENNESSEE's gunfire again helped to clear
the way. With the other old battlewagons, she remained in support
until organized resistance was declared at an end on 21 June. By
this time, the scene in the air was different. Besides Navy
carrier planes, large numbers of Army Air Force fighters were now
flying from Okinawan fields; and the days when everything that
flew was a cause for alarm had ended-for the time being.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Vice Admiral
Oldendorf was subsequently placed in command of naval forces in
the Ryukyus, and TENNESSEE flew his flag as she covered
minesweeping operations in the East China Sea and patrolled the
waters off Shanghai for Japanese shipping as escort carriers sent
strikes against the China coast. This was TENNESSEE's station
until V-J Day brought an end to the war in the Pacific. When this
glad day came, the big ship was operating out of Okinawa and
preparing to take part in the planned invasion of Japan.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleship's
final assignment of the war was to cover the landing of
occupation troops at Wakayama, Japan. She arrived there on 23
September, then went on to Yokosuka. TENNESSEE's crew had the
chance to look over the Imperial Navy's big shipyard and
operating base and do some sightseeing before she got underway
for Singapore on 16 October. At Singapore Oldendorf shifted his
flag to the cruiser Springfield (CL-66), and TENNESSEE continued
her long voyage home by way of the Cape of Good Hope.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On the fourth
anniversary of Pearl Harbor, the old veteran moored at the
Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. During those years, she had hurled
9,347 14-inch rounds at the enemy, with 46,341 shells from her
5-inch guns and more than 100,000 rounds from her antiaircraft
battery.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The process of
trimming the wartime Navy down to postwar size was already well
underway. TENNESSEE was one of the older, yet still useful, ships
selected for inclusion in the &quot;mothball fleet;&quot; and,
during 1946, she underwent a process of preservation and
preparation for inactivation. The work went slowly; there were
many ships to lay up and not too many people to do it. Finally,
on 14 February 1947, TENNESSEE's ensign was hauled down for the
last time as she was placed out of commission.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE remained
in the inactive fleet for another 12 years. By then, time and
technology had passed her by; and, on 1 March 1959, her name was
struck from the Naval Vessel Register. On 10 July of that year,
she was sold to the Bethlehem Steel Company for scrapping.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">TENNESSEE earned a
Navy Unit Commendation and 10 battles stars for World War II
service.</font></p>
