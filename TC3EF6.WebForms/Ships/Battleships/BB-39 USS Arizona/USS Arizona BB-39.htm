<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The second ARIZONA
(Battleship No. 39) was laid down on 16 March 1914 at the New
York Navy Yard; launched on 19 June 1915; sponsored by Miss
Esther Ross, daughter of a prominent ARIZONA pioneer citizen, Mr.
W. W. Ross of Prescott, Ariz.; and commissioned at her builder's
yard on 17 October 1916, Capt. John D. McDonald in command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ARIZONA departed
New York on 16 November 1918 for shakedown training off the
Virginia capes and Newport, proceeding thence to Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba. Returning north to Norfolk on 16 December to test fire her
battery and to conduct torpedodefense exercises in Tangier Sound.
The battleship returned to her builders yard the day before
Christmas of 1916 for post-shakedown overhaul. Completing these
repairs and alterations on 3 April 1917, she cleared the yard on
that date for Norfolk, arriving there on the following day to
join Battleship Division 8.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Within days, the
United States forsook its tenuous neutrality in the global
conflict then raging and entered World War I. The new battleship
operated out of Norfolk throughout the war, serving as a gunnery
training ship and patrolling the waters of the eastern seaboard
from the Virginia Capes to New York. An oilburner, she had not
been deployed to European waters owning to a scarcity of fuel oil
in the British Isles-the base of other American battleships sent
to aid the Grand Fleet.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">A week after the
armistice of 11 November 1918 stilled the guns on the western
front, ARIZONA stood out of Hampton Roads for Portland, England,
and reached her destination on 30 November 1918, putting to sea
with her division on 12 December to rendezvous with the transport
GEORGE WASHINGTON, the ship carrying President Woodrow Wilson to
the Paris Peace Conference. ARIZONA, one of the newest and most
powerful American dreadnoughts, served as part of the honor
escort convoying the American President to Brest, France, on 13
December 1918.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Embarking 238
homeward-bound veterans in the precursor of a &quot;Magic
Carpet&quot; operation of a later war, ARIZONA sailed from Brest
for New York on 14 December, and arrived off Ambrose Light on the
afternoon of Christmas Day, 1918. The next day, she passed in
review before Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, who was
embarked in the yacht MAYFLOWER off the Statue of Liberty, before
entering New York Harbor in a great homecoming celebration. The
battleship then sailed for Hampton Roads on 22 January 1919,
returning to her base at Norfolk on the following day.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ARIZONA sailed for
Guantanamo Bay with the Fleet on 4 February 1919, and arrived on
the 8th. After engaging in battle practices and maneuvers there,
the battleship sailed for Trinidad on 17 March, arriving there
five days later or a three-day port visit. She then returned to
Guantanamo Bay on 29 March or a brief period, sailing for Hampton
Roads on 9 April. Arriving at her destination on the morning of
the 12th, she got underway late that afternoon for Brest, France,
ultimately making arrival there on 21 April 1919.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleship
stood out of Brest harbor on 3 May, bound for Asia Minor, and
arrived at the port of Smyrna eight days later to protect
American lives there during the Greek occupation of that port-an
occupation resisted by gunfire from Turkish nationals. ARIZONA
provided temporary shelter on board for a party of Greek
nationals, while the battleship's marine detachment guarded the
American consulate; a number of American citizens also remained
on board ARIZONA until conditions permitted them to return
ashore. Departing Smyrna on 9 June for Constantinople, Turkey,
the battleship carried the United States consul-at-large, Leland
E. Morris, to that port before sailing for New York on 15 June.
Proceeding via Gibraltar, ARIZONA reached her destination on 30
June.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Entering the New
York Navy Yard for upkeep soon thereafter, the battleship cleared
that port on 6 January 1920 to join Battleship Division 7 for
winter and spring maneuvers in the Caribbean. She operated out of
Guantanamo Bay during this period, and also visited Bridgetown,
Barbadoes, in the British West Indies, and Colon, in the Canal
Zone, before she sailed north for New York, arriving there on 1
May 1920. Departing New York on 17 May, ARIZONA operated on the
Southern Drill Grounds, and then visited Norfolk and Annapolis,
before returning to New York on 25 June. Over the next six
months, the ship operated locally out of New York. During this
time she was given the alphanumeric hull designation, BB-39, on
17 July 1920, and, on 23 August, she became flag ship for
Commander Battleship Division 7, Rear Admiral Edward V. Eberle.
Sailing from New York on 4 January 1921, ARIZONA joined the feet
as it sailed for Guantanamo Bay and the Panama Canal Zone.
Arriving at Colon, on the Atlantic side of the isthmuian
waterway, on 19 January, ARIZONA transited the Panama Canal for
the first time on that day, arriving at Panama Bay on the 20th.
Underway for Callao, Peru, on the 22d, the fleet arrived there
nine days later, on the 31st, for a six-day visit. While she was
there ARIZONA was visited by the President of Peru. Under way for
Balboa on 5 February 1921, ARIZONA arrived at he destination on
the 14th; transiting the canal again the day after Washington's
Birthday, the battleship reached Guantanamo Bay on the 6th. She
operated thence until 24 April 1921, when she sailed for New
York, steaming via Hampton Roads.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ARIZONA reached
New York on 29 April, and remained under overhaul there until 15
June. She steamed thence for Hampton Roads on the latter date,
and on the 21st steamed off Cape Charles with Army and Navy
observers to witness the experimental bombings of the ex-German
submarine U-117. Proceeding thence back to New York, the
battleship there broke the flag of Vice Admiral John D. McDonald
(who, as a captain, had been ARIZONA's first commanding officer)
on 1 July and sailed for Panama and Peru on 9 July. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">She arrived at the
port of Callao on 22 July as flagship for the Battle Force,
Atlantic Fleet, to observe the celebrations accompanying the
centennial year of Peruvian independence. On 27 July, Vice
Admiral McDonald went ashore and represented the United States at
the unveiling of a monument commemorating the accomplishments of
San Martin, who had liberated Peru from the Spanish yoke a
century before.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Sailing for Panama
Bay on 9 August, ARIZONA became flagship for Battleship Division
7 when Vice Admiral McDonald transferred his flag to WYOMING
(BB-33) and Rear Admiral Josiah S. McKean broke his flag on board
as commander of the division on 10 August at Balboa. The
following day, the battleship sailed for San Diego arriving there
on 21 August 1921.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Over the next 14
years, ARIZONA alternately served as flagship for Battleship
Divisions 2, 9 or 4. Based at San Pedro, during this period,
ARIZONA operated with the fleet in the operating areas off the
coast of southern California or in the Caribbean during fleet
concentrations there. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">She participated
in a succession of fleet problems (the annual maneuvers of the
fleet that served as the culmination of the training year),
ranging from the Caribbean to the waters off the west coast of
central America and the Canal Zone; from the West Indies to the
waters between Hawaii and the west coast.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Following her
participation in Fleet Problem IX (January 1929), ARIZONA
transited the Panama Canal on 7 February for Guantanamo Bay,
whence she operated through April. She then proceeded to Norfolk
Navy Yard, entering it on 4 May 1929 to prepare for
modernization.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Placed in reduced
commission on 15 July 1929, ARIZONA remained in yard hands for
the next 20 months; tripod masts, surmounted by three-tiered fire
control tops, replaced the old cage masts; 5-inch, 25-caliber
antiaircraft guns replaced the 3-inch, 50s with which she had
been equipped. She also received additional armor to protect her
vitals from the fall of shot and blisters to protect her from
torpedo or near-miss damage from bombs. In addition, she received
new boilers as well as new main and cruising turbines.
Ultimately, she was placed in full commission on 1 March 1931.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">A little over two
weeks later, on 19 March 1931, President Herbert C. Hoover
embarked on board the recently modernized battleship, and sailed
for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, standing out to sea from
Hampton Roads that day. Returning on 29 March, ARIZONA
disembarked the Chief Executive and his party at Hampton Roads,
and then proceeded north to Rockland, Maine, to run her
post-modernization standardization trials. After a visit to
Boston, the battleship dropped down to Norfolk, whence she sailed
for San Pedro on 1 August 1931, assigned to Battleship Division
3, Battle Force.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Over the next
decade, ARIZONA continued to operate with the Battle Fleet, and
took part in the succession of fleet problems that took the fleet
from the waters of the northern Pacific and Alaska to those
surrounding the West Indies, and into the waters east of the
lesser Antilles.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 17 September
1938, ARIZONA became the flagship for Battleship Division 1, when
Rear Admiral Chester W. Nimitz (later to become
Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet) broke his flag on board.
Detached 27 May 1939 to become Chief of the Bureau of Navigation,
Nimitz was relieved on that day by Rear Admiral Russell Willson.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ARIZONA's last
fleet problem was XXI. At its conclusion, the United States Fleet
was retained in Hawaiian waters, based at Pearl Harbor. She
operated in the Hawaiian Operating Area until late that summer,
when she returned to Long Beach on 30 September 1940. She was
then overhauled at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton Wash.,
into the following year. Her last flag change-of-command occurred
on 23 January 1941, when Rear Admiral Wilson was relieved as
Commander, Battleship Division 1 by Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleship
returned to Pearl Harbor on 3 February 1941 to resume the
intensive training maintained by the Pacific Fleet. She made one
last visit to the West coast, clearing &quot;Pearl&quot; on 11
June 1941 for Long Beach, ultimately returning to her Hawaiian
base on 8 July. Over the next five months, she continued
exercises and battle problems of various kinds on type training
and tactical exercises in the Hawaiian operating area. She
underwent a brief overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard
commencing on 27 October 1941, receiving the foundation for a
search radar atop her foremast. She conducted her last training
in company with her division mates NEVADA (BB-36) and OKLAHOMA
(BB-37), conducting a night firing exercise on the night of 4
December 1941. All three ships moored at quays (&quot;keys&quot;)
along Ford Island on the 5th.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Scheduled to
receive tender availability, ARIZONA took the repair ship VESTAL
(AR-4) along side on Saturday, the 6th. The two ships were thus
moored together on the morning of 7 December; among the men on
board ARIZONA that morning were Rear Admiral Kidd and the
battleship's captain, Capt. Franklin van Valkenburgh.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Shortly before
0800, Japanese aircraft from six fleet carriers struck the
Pacific Fleet as it lay in port at Pearl Harbor, and in the
ensuing two attack waves, wrought devastation on the Battle Line
and on air and military facilities defending Pearl Harbor.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On board ARIZONA,
the ship's air raid alarm went off about 0755 and the ship went
to general quarters soon thereafter. Insofar as it could be
determined soon after the attack, the ship sustained eight bomb
hits; one hit on the forecastle, glancing off the face plate of
turret II to penetrating the deck to explode in the black powder
magazine, which in turn set off adjacent smokeless power
magazines. A cataclysmic explosion ripped through the forward
part of the ship, touching off fierce fires that burned for two
days; debris showered down on Ford Island in the vicinity.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Acts of heroism on
the part of ARIZONA's officers and men were many, headed by those
of Lt. Comdr. Samuel G. Fuqua, the ship's damage control officer,
whose coolness in attempting to quell the fires and get survivors
off the ship earned him the Medal of Honor. Posthumous awards of
the Medal of Honor also went to Rear Admiral Isaac Kidd, the
first flag officer to be killed in the Pacific war, and to Capt.
Van Valkenburgh, who reached the bridge and was attempting to
fight his ship when the bomb hit on the magazines destroyed her.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The blast that
destroyed ARIZONA and sank her at her berth alongside of Ford
Island consumed the lives of 1,103 of the 1,400 on board at the

struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 1942. Her
wreck was cut down so that very little of the superstructure lay
above water; her after main battery turrets and guns were removed
to be emplaced as coast defense guns. ARIZONA's wreck remains at
Pearl Harbor, a memorial to the men of her crew lost that
December morn in 1941. On 7 March 1950, Admiral Arthur W.
Radford, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet at that time,

legislation during the administrations of Presidents Dwight D.
Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy designated the wreck a national
shrine. A memorial was built; it was dedicated on 30 May 1962.</font></p>
