<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The fourth IDAHO
(BB-42) was launched by New York shipbuilding Corp., Camden,
N.J., 30 June 1917; sponsored by Miss H. A. Limons, granddaughter
of the Governor of IDAHO; and commissioned 24 March 1919, Captain
C. T. Vogelgesang In command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">IDAHO sailed 13
April for shakedown training out of Guantanamo Bay, and after
returning to New York received President Pessoa of Brazil for the
voyage to Rio de Janeiro. Departing 6 July with her escort, the
battleship arrived Rio 17 July 1919. From there she set course
for the Panama Canal, arriving Monterey, Calif., in September to
join the Pacific Fleet. She joined other dreadnoughts in training
exercises and reviews, including a Fleet Review by President
Wilson 13 September 1919. In 1920 the battleship carried
Secretary Daniels and the Secretary of the Interior on an
inspection tour of Alaska.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Upon her return
from Alaska 22 July 1920 IDAHO took part in fleet maneuvers off
the California coast and as far south as Chile. She continued
this important training until 1925, taking part In numerous
ceremonies on the West Coast during the interim. IDAHO took part
in the fleet review held by President Harding In Seattle shortly
before his death In 1923. The battleship sailed 15 April 1925 for
Hawaii, participated in war games until 1 July, and then got
underway for Samoa, Australia, and New Zealand. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On the return
voyage IDAHO embarked gallant Comdr. John Rodgers and his
seaplane crew after their attempt to fly to Hawaii, arriving San
Francisco 24 September 1925.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">For the next 6
years IDAHO operated out of San Pedro on training and readiness
operations off California and in the Caribbean. She sailed from
San Pedro 7 September 1931 for the East Coast, entering Norfolk
Navy Yard 30 September for modernization. The veteran battleship
received better armor, &quot;blister&quot; antisubmarine
protection, better machinery, and tripod masts during this
extensive overhaul, and was readied for many more years of useful
naval service. After completion 9 October 1934 the ship conducted
shakedown in the Caribbean before returning to her home port, San
Pedro, 17 April 1935.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As war clouds
gathered in the Pacific, the fleet increased the tempo of its
training operations. IDAHO carried out fleet tactics and gunnery
exercises regularly until arriving with the battle fleet at Pearl
Harbor 1 July 1940. The ship sailed for Hampton Roads 6 June 1941
to perform Atlantic neutrality patrol, a vital part of U.S.
policy in the early days of the European fighting. She moved to
Iceland In September to protect American advance bases and was on
station at Hvalfjordur when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor 7
December 1941 and catapulted America into the war.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">IDAHO and sister
ship MISSISSIPPI departed Iceland 2 days after Pearl Harbor to
join the Pacific Fleet, and arrived San Francisco via Norfolk and
the Panama Canal 31 January 1942. She conducted additional battle
exercises in California waters and out of Pearl Harbor until
October 1942, when she entered Puget Sound Navy Yard to be
regunned. Upon completion of this work IDAHO again took part in
battle exercises, and sailed 7 April 1943 for operations in the
bleak Aleutians. There she was flagship of the bombardment and
patrol force around Attu, where she gave gunfire support to the
Army landings 11 May 1943. During the months that followed she
concentrated on Kiska, culminating in an assault 15 August. The
Japanese were found to have evacuated island in late July, thus
abandoning their last foothold in the Aleutians.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">IDAHO returned to
San Francisco 7 September 1943 to prepare for the invasion of the
Gilbert islands. Moving to Pearl Harbor, she got underway with
the assault fleet 10 November and arrived off Makin Atoll 20
November. She supported the fighting ashore with accurate gunfire
support and antiaircraft fire, remaining in the Gilbert until
sailing for Pearl Harbor 5 December 1943.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Next on the
Pacific timetable was the invasion of the Marshalls, and the
veteran battleship arrived off Kwajalein early 31 January to
soften up shore positions. Again she hurled tons of shells into
Japanese positions until 5 February, when the outcome was one of
certain victory. After replenishing at Majuro she bombarded other
islands in the group, then moved to Kavieng, New Ireland, for a
diversionary bombardment 20 March 1944.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">IDAHO returned to
the New Hebrides 25 March, and after a short stay In Australia
arrived Kwajalein with a group of escort carriers 8 June. From
there the ships steamed to the Marianas, where IDAHO began a
preinvasion bombardment of Siapan 14 June. With this brilliantly
executed landing assault underway 15 June, the battleship moved
to Guam for bombardment assignments. As the American fleet
decimated Japanese carrier air power in the Battle of the
Philippine Sea 19 to 21 June, IDAHO protected the precious
transport area and reserve convoys. After returning briefly to
Eniwetok 28 June to 9 July the ship began preinvasion bombardment
of Guam 12 July, and continued the devastating shelling until the
main assault eight days later. As ground troops battled for the
island, IDAHO stood offshore providing vital support until
anchoring at Eniwetok 2 August 1944.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The ship continued
to Espiritu Santo and entered a floating dry dock 15 August for
repairs to her &quot;blisters&quot; After landing rehearsals on
Guadalcanal in early September, IDAHO moved to Peleliu 12
September and began bombarding the island, needed as a staging
base for the invasion of the Philippines. Despite the furious
bombardment, Japanese entrenchments gave assault forces stiff
opposition, and the battleship remained off Peleliu until 24
September providing the all-important fire support for advancing
marines. She then sailed for Manus and eventually to Bremerton,
Wash., where she arrived for needed repairs 22 October 1944. This
was followed by battle practice off California.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">IDAHO's mighty
guns were need for the next giant amphibious assault on the way
to Japan. She sailed from San Diego 20 January 1945 to join a
battleship group at Pearl Harbor. After rehearsals she steamed
from the Marianas 14 February for the invasion of Iwo Jima. As
marines stormed ashore 19 February IDAHO was again blasting enemy
positions with her big guns. She remained off Iwo Jima until 7
March, when she underway for Ulithi and the last of the great
Pacific assaults-Okinawa.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">IDAHO sailed 21
March 1945 as part of Rear Admiral Deyo's Gunfire and Covering
Group and flagship of Bombardment Unit 4. She arrived offshore 25
March and began silencing enemy shore batteries and pounding
installations. The landings began 1 April, and as the Japanese
made a desperate attempt to drive the vast fleet away with
suicide attacks, IDAHO's gunners shot down numerous planes. In a
massed attack 12 April the battleship shot down five kamikazes
before suffering damage to her port blisters from a near-miss.
After temporary repairs she sailed 20 April and arrived Guam five
days later.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The veteran of so
many of the landings of the Pacific quickly completed repairs and
returned to Okinawa 22 May to resume fire support. IDAHO remained
until 20 June 1945, then sailed for battle maneuvers in Leyte
Gulf until hostilities ceased 15 August 1945.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">IDAHO made her
triumphal entry into Tokyo Bay with occupation troops 27 August,
and witnessed the signing of the surrender on board MISSOURI 2
September. Four days later she began the long voyage to the East
Coast of the United States, steaming via the Panama Canal to
Norfolk 16 October 1945. She decommissioned 3 July 1946 and was
placed in reserve until sold for scrap 24 November 1947 to
Lipsett Inc., of New York City.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">IDAHO received
seven battle stars for World War II service.</font></p>
