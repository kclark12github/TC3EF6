<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The fifth NEW YORK
(BB-34) was laid down 11 September 1911 by Brooklyn Navy Yard,
New York; launched 30 October 1912; sponsored by Miss Elsie
Calder; and commissioned 15 April 1914, Captain Thomas S. Rodgers
in command. Ordered south soon after commissioning, NEW YORK was
flagship for Rear Admiral Frank Fletcher, commanding the fleet
occupying and blockading Vera Cruz until resolution of the crisis
with Mexico in July 1914. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW YORK then
headed north for fleet operations along the Atlantic coast as war
broke out in Europe.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Upon the entry of
the United States into the war, NEW YORK sailed as flagship with
Battleship Division 9 commanded by Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman to
strengthen the British Grand Fleet in the North Sea, arriving
Scapa Flow 7 December 1917. Constituting a separate squadron in
the Grand Fleet, the American ships joined in blockade and escort
missions and by their very presence so weighted the Allies'
preponderance of naval power as to inhibit the Germans from
attempting any major fleet engagement's. NEW YORK twice
encountered U-boats.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">During her World
War I service, NEW YORK was frequently visited by royal and other
high-ranking representatives of the Allies, and she was present
for one of the most dramatic moments of the war, the surrender of
the German High Seas Fleet in the Firth of Forth 21 November
1918. As a last European mission, NEW YORK joined the ships
escorting President Woodrow Wilson from an ocean rendezvous, to
Brest en route the Versailles Conference.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Returning to a
program which alternated individual and fleet exercises with
necessary maintenance, NEW YORK trained in the Caribbean in
spring 1919, and that summer joined the Pacific Fleet at San
Diego, her home port for the next 16 years. She trained off
Hawaii and the West Coast, occasionally returning to the Atlantic
and Caribbean for brief missions or overhauls. In 1937, carrying
Admiral Hugh Rodman, the President's personal representative for
the coronation of King George VI of England, NEW YORK sailed to
take part in the Grand Naval Review of 20 May 1937 as sole U.S.
Navy representative.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">For much of the
following 3 years, NEW YORK trained Naval Academy midshipmen and
other prospective officers with cruises to Europe, Canada, and
the Caribbean, and in mid- 1941 she joined the Neutrality Patrol.
She escorted troops to Iceland in July 1941, then served as
station ship at Argentia, Newfoundland, protecting the new
American base there. From America's entry into World War II, NEW
YORK guarded Atlantic convoys to Iceland and Scotland when the
U-boat menace was gravest, submarine contacts were numerous, but
the convoys were brought to harbor intact.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW YORK brought
her big guns to the invasion of North Africa, providing crucial
gunfire support at Safi 8 November 1942. She then stood by at
Casablanca and Fedhala before returning home for convoy duty
escorting critically needed men and supplies to North Africa. She
then took up important duty training gunners for battleships and
destroyer escorts in Chesapeake Bay, rendering this vital service
until 10 June 1944, when she began the first of 3 training
cruises for the Naval Academy, voyaging to Trinidad on each.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW YORK sailed 21
November for the West Coast, arriving San Pedro 6 December for
gunnery training in preparation for amphibious operations. She
departed San Pedro 12 January 1945, called at Pearl Harbor, and
was diverted to Eniwetok to survey screw damage. Nevertheless,
despite impaired speed, she joined the Iwo Jima assault force in
rehearsals at Saipan. She sailed well ahead of the main body to
join in preinvasion bombardment at Iwo Jima 16 February. During
the next 3 days, she fired more rounds than any other ship
present; and, as if to show what an old-timer could do, made a
spectacular direct 14&quot;-hit on an enemy ammunition dump.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Leaving Iwo Jima,
NEW YORK at last repaired her propellers at Manus, and had speed
restored for the assault on Okinawa, which she reached 27 March
to begin 76 consecutive days of action. She fired preinvasion and
diversionary bombardments, covered landings, and gave days and
nights of close support to troops advancing ashore. She did not
go unscathed; a kamikaze grazed her 14 April, demolishing her
spotting plane on its catapult. She left Okinawa 11 June to regun
at Pearl Harbor.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW YORK prepared
at Pearl Harbor for the planned invasion of Japan, and after
war's end, made a voyage to the West Coast returning veterans and
bringing out their replacements. She sailed from Pearl Harbor
again 29 September with passengers for NEW YORK, arriving 19
October. Here she prepared to serve as target ship in operation
&quot;Crossroads,&quot; the Bikini atomic tests, sailing 4 March
1946 for the West Coast. She left San Francisco 1 May, and after
calls in Pearl Harbor and Kwajalein, reached Bikini 15 June.
Surviving the surface blast 1 July and the <br>
underwater explosion 25 July, she was taken into Kwajalein and
decommissioned there 29 August 1946. Later towed to Pearl Harbor,
she was studied during the next two years, and on 8 July 1948 was
towed out to sea some 40 miles and there sunk after an 8-hour
pounding by ships and planes carrying out full-scale battle
maneuvers with new weapons.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW YORK received
3 battle stars for World War II service. </font></p>
