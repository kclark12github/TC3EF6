<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MARYLAND (BB-46)
was laid down 24 April 1917 by Newport News Shipbuilding Co.,
Newport News, Va.; launched 20 March 1920; sponsored by Mrs. E.
Brook Lee, wife of the Comptroller of the State of Maryland; and
commissioned 21 July 1921, Capt. C. F. Preston In command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">With a new type
seaplane catapult and the Brat 16-Inch guns mounted on a U.S.
ship, MARYLAND was the pride of the Navy. Following an east coast
shakedown she found herself in great demand for special
occasions. She appeared at Annapolis for the 1922 Naval Academy
graduation and at Boston for the anniversary of Bunker Hill and
the Fourth of July. Between 18 August and 25 September she paid
her first visit to a foreign port transporting Secretary of State
Charles Evans Hughes to Rio de Janeiro for Brazil's Centennial
Exposition. The next year, after fleet exercises off the Panama
Canal Zone. Maryland transited the canal In the latter part of
June to join the battle fleet stationed on the west coast.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">She made a good
will voyage to Australia and New Zealand In 1925, and transported
President-elect Herbert Hoover on the Pacific leg of his tour of
Latin America In 1928. Throughout these years and the 1930's she
served as a mainstay of fleet readiness through tireless training
operations. In 1940 MARYLAND and the other battleships of the
battle force changed their bases of operations to Pearl Harbor.
She was present at battleship row along Ford Island when Japan
struck 7 December 1941.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">A gunner's mate
striker, writing a letter near his machine-gun, brought the first
of his ship's guns into play, shooting down one of two attacking
torpedo planes. Inboard of OKLAHOMA and thus protected from the
initial torpedo attack, MARYLAND managed to bring all her
antiaircraft batteries into action. Despite two bomb hits she
continued to fire and, after the attack, sent firefighting
parties to assist her sister ships. The Japanese announced that
she had been sunk, but 30 December, battered yet sturdy, the
entered the repair yard at Puget Sound Navy Yard.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">She emerged 26
February 1942 not only repaired but modernized and ready for
great service. During the important Battle of Midway, the old
battleships, not fast enough to accompany the carriers, operated
as a backup force. Thereafter MARYLAND engaged in almost constant
training exercises until 1 August, when she returned to Pearl
Harbor.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Assigned sentinel
duty along the southern supply routes to Australia and the
Pacific fighting fronts, MARYLAND and COLORADO operated out of
the Fiji Islands in November and advanced to the New Hebrides in
February 1943. Her return to Pearl Harbor after 10 months in the
heat of the South Pacific brought the installation of additional
40mm. antiaircraft protection.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In the vast
amphibious campaigns of the Pacific the firepower of MARYLAND and
her sister ships played a key role. Departing the Hawaiian
Islands 20 October for the South Pacific, MARYLAND became
flagship for Rear Adm. Harry W. Hill's Southern Attack Force in
the Gilberts Invasion, with Maj. Gen. Julian C. Smith, Commander,
2d Marine Division, embarked. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Early on 20
November her big guns commenced 5 days of shore bombardment and
call fire assignment in support of one of the most gallant
amphibious assaults in history, at Tarawa. After the island's
capture, she remained in the area protecting the transports until
she headed back to the United States 7 December.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MARYLAND steamed
from San Pedro 13 January 1944, rendezvoused with TF 53 at
Hawaii, and sailed in time to be in position off the
well-fortified Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshalls on the morning of
the 31st. Assigned to reduce pillboxes and blockhouses on Roi
Island, the old battleship fired splendidly all day and again the
following morning until the assault waves were within 500 yards
of the beach. Following the operation she steamed back to
Bremerton, Wash., for new guns and an overhaul.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Two months later
MARYLAND, again readied for battle, sailed westward 5 May to
participate in the biggest campaign yet attempted in the Pacific
war-Saipan. Vice Adm. R. K. Turner allotted TF 52.3 days to
soften up the island before the assault. Firing commenced 0545 on
14 June. Silencing two coastal guns, MARYLAND encountered little
opposition as she delivered one devastating barrage after
another. The Japanese attempted to strike back through the air.
On the 18th the ship's guns claimed their first victim but 4 days
later a Betty sneaked in flying low over the still-contested
Saipan hills and found two anchored battleships. Crossing the bow
of Pennsylvania, she dropped a torpedo which opened a gaping hole
in Maryland's bow, portside. Casualties were light and in 15
minutes she was underway for Eniwetok, and shortly thereafter to
the repair yards at Pearl Harbor.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">With an
around-the-clock effort by the shipyard workers, on 19 August, 34
days after arrival, the ship again steamed forth for the war
zone. Rehearsing briefly in the Solomons, she joined Rear Adm. J.
B. Oldendorf's Western Fire Support Group (TG 32.5) bound for the
Palau Islands. Firing first on 12 September to cover minesweeping
operations and underwater demolition teams, she continued the
shore bombardment until the landing craft approached the beaches
on the 15th. Four days later organized resistance collapsed,
permitting the fire support ships to retire to the Admiralty
Islands.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Reassigned to the
7th Fleet, MARYLAND sortied 12 October to cover the important
initial landings in the Philippines at Leyte. Despite floating
mines, the invasion force entered Leyte Gulf on the 18th. The
bombardment the following day and the landings of the 20th went
well, but the Japanese decided to contest this success with both
kamikazes and a three-pronged naval attack.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Forewarned by
submarines and scout planes, the American battleship-cruiser
force steamed 24 October to the southern end of Leyte Gulf to
protect Surigao Strait. Early on the 25th the enemy battleships
FUSO and YAMISHIRO led the Japanese advance into the Strait. The
waiting Americans pounded the enemy ships severely. First came
torpedoes from the fleeting PT boats, then more torpedoes from
the daring destroyers. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Next came gunfire
from the cruisers. Finally, at 0355 the readied guns of the
battleship line opened fire. Thunderous salvos of heavy caliber
fire slowed the enemy force and set the Japanese battleships on
fire. Leaving their doomed battleships behind, the decimated
enemy ships fled; only a remnant of the original force escaped
subsequent naval air attacks. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Similarly other
U.S. forces blunted and repulsed attacks by the center and
northern enemy forces during the decisive Battle for Leyte Gulf.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In the aftermath
of this important victory, Maryland patrolled the southern
approaches to Surigao Strait until 29 October; after
replenishment at Manus, Admiralties, she resumed patrol duty 16
November. Japanese air attacks continued to pose a definite
threat. During a raid on 17 November, guns of TG 77.2 splashed 11
of the attacking planes. Shortly after sunset 2 days later, a
determined suicide plane dove through the clouds and crashed
Maryland between turrets Nos. 1 and 2. Thirty-one sailors died in
the explosion and fire that followed; however, the sturdy
battleship continued her patrols until relieved 2 December. She
reached Pearl Harbor 18 December and during the next 2 months
workmen repaired and refitted &quot;Fighting Mary.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After refresher
training, Maryland headed for the western Pacific 4 March 1945,
arriving Ulithi the 16th. There she joined Rear Adm. M. L. Deyo's
TF 54 and on 21 March departed for the invasion of Okinawa. She
closed the coast of Okinawa 25 March and began pounding assigned
targets along the southwestern part of the Japanese island
fortress. In addition, she provided fire support during a
diversionary raid on the southeast coast drawing enemy defenses
from the main amphibious landings on the western beaches. On 3
April she received a fire support call from MINNEAPOLIS (CA-36).
The cruiser was unable to silence entrenched shore batteries with
8-inch fire and called on &quot;Fighting Mary's&quot; mighty
16-inch guns for aid. The veteran battleship hurled six salvos
which destroyed the enemy artillery.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MARYLAND continued
fire support duty until 7 April when She sailed with TF 54 to
intercept a Japanese surface force to the northward. These ships,
including mighty battleship Yamato, came under intense air
attacks that same day, and planes of the Fast Carrier Task Force
sank six of 10 ships In the force. At dusk on the 7th MARYLAND
took her third hit from enemy planes in 10 months. A suicide
plane loaded with a 500-pound bomb crashed the top of turret No.
3 from starboard. The explosion wiped out the 20mm. mounts,
causing 53 casualties. As before, however, she continued to blast
enemy shore positions with devastating 16inch fire. While
guarding the western transport area 11 April, she splashed two
planes during afternoon raids.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 14 April
MARYLAND left the firing line as escort for retiring transports.
Steaming via the Marianas and Pearl Harbor, she reached Puget
Sound 7 May and entered the Navy Yard at Bremerton the next day
for extensive overhaul. Completing repairs in August, she now
entered the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; fleet. During the next 4
months she made five voyages between the west coast and Pearl
Harbor, returning more than 8,000 combat veterans to the United
States.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Arriving Seattle,
Wash., 17 December, she completed &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; duty.
She entered Puget sound Naval Shipyard 15 April 1946 and was
placed in commission in reserve on an inactive basis 16 July. She
decommissioned at Bremerton 3 April 1947 and remained there as a
unit of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. MARYLAND was sold for
scrapping to Learner Co. of Oakland, Calif., 8 July 1959.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 2 June 1961 the
Honorable J. Millard Tawes, Governor of Maryland, dedicated a
lasting monument to the memory of the venerable battleship and
her fighting men. Built of granite and bronze and incorporating
the bell of &quot;Fighting Mary,&quot; this monument honors a
ship and her men whose service to the Nation reflected the
highest traditions of the naval service. This monument is located
on the grounds of the State House, Annapolis, Md.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">MARYLAND received
seven battle stars for World War II service.</font></p>
