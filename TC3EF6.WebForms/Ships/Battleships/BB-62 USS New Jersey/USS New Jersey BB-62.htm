<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The second NEW
JERSEY (BB-62) was launched 7 December 1942 by the Philadelphia
Naval Shipyard; sponsored by Mrs. Charles Edison, wife of
Governor Edison of New Jersey, former Secretary of the Navy; and
commissioned at Philadelphia 23 May 1943, Captain Carl F. Holden
in command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY
completed fitting out and trained her initial crew in the Western
Atlantic and Caribbean. On 7 January 1944 she passed through the
Panama Canal war-bound for Funafuti, Ellice Islands. She reported
there 22 January for duty with the Fifth Fleet, and three days
later rendezvoused with Task Group 58.2 for the assault on the
Marshall Islands. NEW JERSEY screened the carriers from enemy
attack as their aircraft flew strikes against Kwajalein and
Eniwetok 29 January-2 February, softening up the latter for its
invasion and supporting the troops who landed 31 January.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY began
her distinguished career as a flagship 4 February in Majuro
Lagoon when Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, commanding the Fifth
Fleet, broke his flag from her main. Her first action as a
flagship was a bold two-day surface and air strike by her task
force against the supposedly impregnable Japanese fleet base on
Truk in the Carolines. This blow was coordinated with the assault
on Kwajalein, and effectively interdicted Japanese naval
retaliation to the conquest of the Marshalls. On 17 and 18
February; the task force accounted for two Japanese light
cruisers, four destroyers, three auxiliary cruisers, two
submarine tenders, two submarine chasers, an armed trawler, a
plane ferry, and 23 other auxiliaries, not including small craft.
NEW JERSEY destroyed a trawler and, with other ships, sank
destroyer MAIKAZE, as well as firing on an enemy plane which
attacked her formation. The task force returned to the Marshalls
19 February.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Between 17 March
and 10 April, NEW JERSEY first sailed with Rear Admiral Marc A.
Mitscher's flagship LEXINGTON (CV-16) for an air and surface
bombardment of Mille, then rejoined Task Group 58.2 for a strike
against shipping in the Palaus, and bombarded Woleai. Upon his
return to Majuro, Admiral Spruance transferred his flag to
INDIANAPOLIS (CA-35).</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY's next
war cruise, 13 April-4 May, began and ended at Majuro. She
screened the carrier striking force which gave air support to the
invasion of Aitape, Tanahmerah Bay and Humboldt, Bay, New Guinea,
22 April, then bombed shipping and shore installations at Truk
29-30 April. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY and her
formation splashed two enemy torpedo bombers at Truk. Her
sixteen-inch salvos pounded Ponape 1 May, destroying fuel tanks,
badly damaging the airfield, and demolishing a headquarters
building.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After rehearsing
in the Marshalls for the invasion of the Marianas, NEW JERSEY put
to sea 6 June in the screening and bombardment group of Admiral
Mitscher's Task Force. On the second day of preinvasion air
strikes, 12 June, NEW JERSEY downed an enemy torpedo bomber, and
during the next two days her heavy guns battered Saipan and
Tinian, throwing steel against the beaches the marines would
charge 15 June.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The Japanese
response to the Marianas operation was an order to its Mobile
Fleet; it must attack and annihilate the American invasion force.
Shadowing American submarines tracked the Japanese fleet into the
Philippine Sea as Admiral Spruance joined his task force with
Admiral Mitscher's to meet the enemy. NEW JERSEY took station in
the protective screen around the carriers on 19 June as American
and Japanese pilots dueled in the Battle of the Philippine Sea.
That day and the next were to pronounce the doom of Japanese
naval aviation; in this &quot;Marianas Turkey Shoot,&quot; the
Japanese lost some 400 planes. This loss of trained pilots and
aircraft was equaled in disaster by the sinking of three Japanese
carriers by submarines and aircraft, and the damaging of two
carriers and a battleship. The antiaircraft fire of NEW JERSEY
and the other screening ships proved virtually impenetrable. Only
two American ships were damaged, and those but slightly. In this
overwhelming victory but 17 American planes were lost to combat.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY's final
contribution to the conquest of the Marianas was in strikes on
Guam and the Palaus from which she sailed for Pearl Harbor,
arriving 9 August. Here she broke the flag of Admiral William F.
Halsey, Jr., 24 August, becoming flagship of the Third Fleet. For
the eight months after she sailed from Pearl Harbor 30 August NEW
JERSEY was based at Ulithi. In this climactic span of the Pacific
War, fast carrier task forces ranged the waters off the
Philippines, Okinawa, and Formosa, striking again and again at
airfields, shipping, shore bases, invasion beaches. NEW JERSEY
offered the essential protection required by these forces, always
ready to repel enemy air or surface attack.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In September the
targets were in the Visayas and the southern Philippines, then
Manila and Cavite, Panay, Negros, Leyte, and Cebu. Early in
October raids to destroy enemy air power based on Okinawa and
Formosa were begun in preparation for the Leyte landings 20
October.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">This invasion
brought on the desperate, almost suicidal, last great sortie of
the Imperial Japanese Navy. Its plan for the Battle for Leyte
Gulf included a feint by a northern force of planeless heavy
attack carriers to draw away the battleships, cruisers and fast
carriers with which Admiral Halsey was protecting the landings.
This was to allow the Japanese Center Force to enter the gulf
through San Bernadino Strait. At the opening of the battle planes
from the carriers guarded by NEW JERSEY struck hard at both the
Japanese Southern and Center Forces, sinking a battleship 23
October. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The next day
Halsey shaped his course north after the decoy force had been
spotted. Planes from his carriers sank four of the Japanese
carriers, as well as a destroyer and a cruiser, while NEW JERSEY
steamed south at flank speed to meet the newly developed threat
of the Center force. It had been turned back in a stunning defeat
when she arrived.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY
rejoined her fast carriers near San Bernadino 27 October for
strikes on central and southern Luzon. Two days later, the force
was under suicide attack. In a melee of antiaircraft fire from
the ships and combat air patrol, NEW JERSEY shot down a plane
whose pilot maneuvered it into INTREPID's (CV11) port gun
galleries, while machine gun fire from INTREPID wounded three of
NEW JERSEY's men. During a similar action 25 November three
Japanese planes were splashed by the combined fire of the force,
part of one flaming onto HANCOCK's (CV-19) flight deck. INTREPID
was again attacked, shot down one would-be suicide, but was
crashed by another despite hits scored on the attacker by NEW
JERSEY gunners. NEW JERSEY shot down a plane diving on CABOT
(CVL-28) and hit another which smashed into Cabot's port bow.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In December, NEW
JERSEY sailed with the LEXINGTON task group for air attacks on
Luzon 14-16 December; then found herself in the furious typhoon
which sank three destroyers. Skillful seamanship brought her
through undamaged. She returned to Ulithi on Christmas Eve to be
met by Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY ranged
far and wide from 30 December to 25 January 1945 on her last
cruise as Admiral Halsey's flagship. She guarded the carriers in
their strikes on Formosa, Okinawa, and Luzon, on the coast of
Indo-China, Hong Kong, Swatow and Amoy, and again on Formosa and
Okinawa. At Ulithi 27 January Admiral Halsey lowered his flag in
NEW JERSEY, but it was replaced two days later by that of Rear
Admiral Oscar Badger commanding Battleship Division Seven.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In support of the
assault on Iwo Jima, NEW JERSEY screened the ESSEX (CV-9) group
in air attacks on the island 19-21 February, and gave the same
crucial service for the first major carrier raid on Tokyo 25
February, a raid aimed specifically at aircraft production.
During the next two days, Okinawa was attacked from the air by
the same striking force.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY was
directly engaged in the conquest of Okinawa from 14 March until
16 April. As the carriers prepared for the invasion with strikes
there and on Honshu, NEW JERSEY fought off air raids, used her
seaplanes to rescue downed pilots, defended the carriers from
suicide planes, shooting down at least three and assisting in the
destruction of others. On 24 March she again carried out the
vital battleship role of heavy bombardment, preparing the
invasion beaches for the assault a week later.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">During the final
months of the war, NEW JERSEY was overhauled at Puget Sound Naval
Shipyard, from which she sailed 4 July for San Pedro, Pearl
Harbor, and Eniwetok bound for Guam. Here on 14 August she once
again became flagship of the Fifth Fleet under Admiral Spruance.
Brief stays at Manila and Okinawa preceded her arrival in Tokyo
Bay 17 September, where she served as flagship for the successive
commanders of Naval Forces in Japanese waters until relieved 28
January 1946 by IOWA (BB-61). NEW JERSEY took aboard nearly a
thousand homeward-bound troops with whom she arrived at San
Francisco 10 February.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After west coast
operations and a normal overhaul at Puget Sound, NEW JERSEY's
keel once more cut the Atlantic as she came home to Bayonne, NEW
JERSEY, for a rousing fourth birthday part 23 May 1947. Present
were Governor Alfred E. Driscoll, former Governor Walter E. Edge
and other dignitaries.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Between 7 June and
26 August, NEW JERSEY formed part of the first training squadron
to cruise Northern European waters since the beginning of World
War II. Over two thousand Naval Academy and NROTC midshipmen
received sea-going experience under the command of Admiral
Richard L. Connoly, Commander Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and
Mediterranean, who broke his flag in NEW JERSEY at Rosyth,
Scotland 23 June. She was the scene of official receptions at
Oslo, where King Haakon VII of Norway inspected the crew 2 July,
and at Portsmouth, England. The training fleet was westward bound
18 July for exercises in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After serving at
New York as flagship for Rear Admiral Heber H. McClean,
Commander, Battleship Division One, 12 September-18 October, NEW
JERSEY was inactivated at the New York Naval Shipyard. She was
decommissioned at Bayonne 30 June 1948 and assigned to the New
York Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY was
recommissioned at Bayonne 21 November 1950, Captain David M.
Tyree in command. In the Caribbean she welded her crew into an
efficient body which would meet with distinction the demanding
requirements of the Korean War. She sailed from Norfolk 16 April
1951 and arrived from Japan off the east coast of Korea 17 May.
Vice Admiral Harold M. Martin, commanding the Seventh Fleet.
placed his flag in NEW JERSEY for the next six months.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY's guns
opened the first shore bombardment of her Korean carrier at
Wonsan 20 May. During her two tours of duty in Korean waters, she
was again and again to play the part of seaborne mobile
artillery. In direct support to United Nations troops; or in
preparation for ground actions, in interdicting Communist supply
and communication routes, or in destroying supplies and troop
positions, NEW JERSEY hurled a weight of steel, fire far beyond
the capacity of land artillery, moved rapidly and free from major
attack from one target to another, and at the same time could be
immediately available to guard aircraft carriers should they
require her protection. It was on this first such mission at
Wonsan that she received her only combat casualties of the Korean
War. One of her men was killed and two severely wounded when she
took a hit from a shore battery on her number one turret and
received a near miss aft to port.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Between 23 and 27
May and again 30 May, NEW JERSEY pounded targets near Yangyang
and Kansong, dispersing troop concentrations, dropping a bridge
span, and destroying three large ammunition dumps. Air spotters
reported Yangyang abandoned at the end of this action, while
railroad facilities and vehicles were smashed at Kansong. On 24
May, she lost one of her helicopters when its crew pushed to the
limit of their fuel searching for a downed aviator. They
themselves were able to reach friendly territory and were later
returned to their ship.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">With Admiral
Arthur W. Radford, Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet, and Vice
Admiral C. Turner Joy, Commander Naval Forces Far East aboard,
NEW JERSEY bombarded targets at Wonsan 4 June. At Kansong two
days later she fired her main battery at an artillery regiment
and truck encampment, with Seventh Fleet aircraft spotting
targets and reporting successes. On 28 July off Wonsan the
battleship was again taken under fire by shore batteries. Several
near misses splashed to port, but NEW JERSEY's precision fire
silenced the enemy and destroyed several gun emplacements.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Between 4 and 12
July, NEW JERSEY supported a United Nations push in the Kansong
area, firing at enemy buildup and reorganization positions. As
the, Republic of Korea's First Division hurled itself on the
enemy, shore fire control observers saw NEW JERSEY's salvos hit
directly on enemy mortar emplacements, supply and ammunition
dumps, and personnel concentrations. NEW JERSEY returned to
Wonsan 18 July for an exhibition of perfect firing: five gun
emplacements demolished with five direct hits.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY sailed
to the aid of troops of the Republic of Korea once more 17
August, returning to the Kansong area where for four days she
provided harassing fire by night, and broke up counterattacks by
day, inflicting a heavy toll on enemy troops. She returned to
this general area yet again 29 August, when she fired in an
amphibious demonstration staged behind enemy lines to ease
pressure on the Republic of Korea's troops. The next day she an a
three-day saturation of the Changjon area, with one of her own
helicopters spotting the results: four buildings; destroyed, road
junctions smashed, railroad marshaling yards afire, tracks cut
and uprooted, coal stocks scattered, many buildings and
warehouses set blazing.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Aside from a brief
break in firing 23 September to take aboard wounded from the
Korean frigate APNOK (PF-62), damaged by gunfire, NEW JERSEY was
heavily engaged in bombarding the Kansong area, supporting the
movement of the U.S. Tenth Corps.. The pattern again was
harassing fire by night, destruction of known targets by day.
Enemy movement was restricted by the fire of her big guns. A
bridge, a dam, several gun emplacements, mortar positions,
pillboxes, bunkers, an two ammunition dumps were demolished.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 1 October,
General Omar Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs; of Staff, and
General Matthew B. Ridgeway, Commander in Chief Far East, came on
board to confer with Admiral Martin.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Between 1 and 6
October NEW JERSEY was in action daily at Kansong, Hamhung,
Hungnam, Tanchon, and Songjin. Enemy bunkers and supply
concentrations provided the majority of the targets at Kansong;
at the others NEW JERSEY fired on railroads, tunnels, bridges, an
oil refinery, trains, and shore batteries destroying with
five-inch fire a gun that straddled her. The Kojo area was her
target 16 October as she sailed in company with HMS BELFAST,
pilots from HMAS SYDNEY spotting. The operation was well-planned
and coordinated ad excellent results were obtained.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Another highly
satisfactory day was 16 October, when the spotter over the
Kansong area reported &quot;beautiful shooting every shot on
target-most beautiful shooting I have seen in five years.&quot;
This five hour bombardment leveled ten artillery positions, and
in smashing trenches and bunkers inflicted some 500 casualties.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY dashed
up the North Korean coast raiding transportation facilities from
1 to 6 November. She struck at bridges, road and rail
installations at Wonsan, Hungnam, Tanchon, Iowon, Songjin, and
Chongjin, and left smoking behind her four bridges destroyed,
others badly damaged, two marshaling yards badly torn up, and
many feet of track destroyed. With renewed attacks on Kansong and
near the Chang-San-Got Peninsula 11 and 13 November, NEW JERSEY
completed this tour of duty.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Relieved as
flagship by WISCONSIN (BB-64), NEW JERSEY cleared Yokosuka for
Hawaii, Long Beach and the Panama Canal, and returned to Norfolk
20 December for a six-month overhaul. Between 19 July 1952 and 5
September, she sailed as flagship for Rear Admiral H. R. Thurber,
who commanded the NROTC midshipman training cruise to Cherbourg,
Lisbon, and the Caribbean. Now NEW JERSEY prepared and trained
for her second Korean tour, for which she sailed from Norfolk 5
March 1953.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Shaping her course
via the Panama Canal, Long Beach, and Hawaii, NEW JERSEY reached
Yokosuka 5 April, and next day relived MISSOURI (BB-63) as
flagship of Vice Admiral Joseph H. Clark, Commander Seventh
Fleet. Chongjin felt the weight of her shells 12 April, as NEW
JERSEY returned to action; in seven minutes she scored seven
direct hits, blowing away half the main communications building
there. At Pusan two days later, NEW JERSEY manned her rails to
welcome the President of the Republic of Korea and Madame Rhee,
and American Ambassador Ellis O. Briggs.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY fired
on coastal batteries and buildings at Kojo 16 April; on railway
track and tunnels near Hungnam 18 April; and on gun emplacements
around Wonsan Harbor 20 April, silencing them in five areas after
she had herself take several near misses. Songjin provided
targets 23 April. Her NEW JERSEY scored six direct 16-inch hits
on a railroad tunnel and knocked out two rail bridges.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY added
her muscle to a major air and surface strike on Wonsan 1 May, as
Seventh Fleet planes both attacked the enemy and spotted for the
battleship. She knocked out eleven Communist shore guns that day,
and four days later destroyed the key observation post on the
island of Hodo Pando, commanding the harbor. Two days later
Kalmagak at Wonsan was her target.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Her tenth
birthday, 23 May, was celebrated at Inchon with President and
Madame Rhee, Lieutenant General Maxwell D. Taylor, and other
dignitaries on board. Two days later NEW JERSEY was all war once
more, returning to the west coast at Chinampo to knock out harbor
defense positions.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleship was
under fire at Wonsan 27-29 May, but her five inch guns silenced
the counter-fire, and her 16-inch shells destroyed five gun
emplacements and four gun caves. She also hit a target that
flamed spectacularly: either a fuel storage area or an ammunition
dump.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY
returned to the key task of direct support to troops at Kosong 7
June. On her first mission, she completely destroyed two gun
positions, an observation post, and their supporting trenches,
then stood by on call for further aid. Then it was back to Wonsan
for a day-long bombardment 24 June, aimed at guns placed in
caves. The results were excellent, with eight direct hits on
three caves, one cave demolished, and four others closed. Next
day she returned to troop support at Kosong, her assignment until
10 July, aside from necessary withdrawal for replenishment.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At Wonsan 11-12
July, NEW JERSEY fired one of the most concentrated bombardments
of her Korean duty. For nine hours the first day, and for seven
the second, her guns slammed away on gun positions and bunkers on
Hodo Pando and the mainland with telling effect. At least ten
enemy guns were destroyed, many damaged, and a number of caves
and tunnels sealed. NEW JERSEY smashed radar control positions
and bridges at Kojo 13 July, and was once more on the east coast
bombline 22-24 July to support South Korean troops near Kosong.
These days found her gunners at their most accurate and the
devastation wrought was impressive. A large cave, housing an
important enemy observation post was closed, the end of a
month-long United Nations effort. A great many bunkers, artillery
areas, observation posts, trenches, tanks and other weapons were
destroyed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At sunrise 25 July
NEW JERSEY was off the key port, rail and communications center
of Hungnam, pounding coastal guns, bridges, a factor area, and
oil storage tanks. She sailed north that afternoon, firing at
rail lines and railroad tunnels as she made for Tanchon, where
she launched a whaleboat in an attempt to spot a train known to
run nightly along the coast. Her big guns were trained on two
tunnels between which she hoped to catch the train, but in the
darkness she could not see the results of her six-gun salvo.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY's
mission at Wonsan, next day, was her last. Here she destroyed
large-caliber guns, bunkers, caves and trenches. Two days later,
she learned of the truce. Her crew celebrated during a seven day
visit at Hong Kong, where she anchored 20 August. Operations
around Japan and off Formosa were carried out for the remainder
of her tour, which was highlighted by a visit to Pusan. Here
President Rhee came aboard 16 September to present the Korean
Presidential Unit Citation to the Seventh fleet.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Relieved as
flagship at Yokosuka by WISCONSIN 14 October, NEW JERSEY was
homeward bound the next day, reaching Norfolk 14 November.
During, the next two summers she crossed the Atlantic with
midshipmen on board for training, and during the rest of the year
sharpened her skills with exercises and training maneuvers along
the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY stood
out of Norfolk 7 September 1955 for her first tour of duty with
the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. Her ports of call included
Gibraltar, Valencia, Cannes, Istanbul, Suda Bay; and Barcelona.
She returned to Norfolk 7 January 1956 for the spring program of
training operations. That summer she again carried midshipmen to
Northern Europe for training, bringing them home to Annapolis 31
July. NEW JERSEY sailed for Europe once more 27 August as
flagship of Vice Admiral Charles Wellborn, Jr., Commander Second
Fleet. She called at Lisbon, participated in NATO exercises off
Scotland, and paid an official visit to Norway where Crown Prince
Olaf was a guest. She returned to Norfolk 15 October, and 14
December arrived at New York Naval Shipyard for inactivation. She
was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Bayonne 21 August
1957.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY's third
career began 6 April 1968 when she recommissioned at Philadelphia
Naval Shipyard, Captain J. Edward Snyder in command. Fitted with
improved electronics and a helicopter landing pad and with her
40-millimeter battery removed, she was tailored for use as a
heavy bombardment ship. Her 16-inch guns, it was expected, would
reach targets in Vietnam inaccessible to smaller naval guns and,
in foul weather, safe from aerial attack.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY, now
the world's only active battleship, departed Philadelphia 16 May,
calling at Norfolk and transiting the Panama Canal before
arriving at her new home port of Long Beach, California, 11 June.
Further training off Southern California followed. On 24 July NEW
JERSEY received 16-inch shells and powder tanks from MOUNT KATMAI
(AE-16) by conventional highline transfer and by helicopter lift,
the first time heavy battleship ammunition had been transferred
by helicopter at sea.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Departing Long
Beach 3 September, NEW JERSEY touched at Pearl Harbor and Subic
Bay before sailing 25 September for her first tour of gunfire
support duty along the Vietnamese coast. Near the 17th Parallel
on 30 September, the dreadnought fired her first shots in battle
in over sixteen years. Firing against Communist targets in and
near the so-called Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), her big guns
destroyed two gun positions and two supply areas. She fired
against targets north of the DMZ the following day, rescuing the
crew of a spotting plane forced down at sea by antiaircraft fire.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The next six
months self into a steady pace of bombardment and fire support
missions along the Vietnamese coast, broken only by brief visits
to Subic Bay and replenishment operations at sea. In her first
two months on the gun line, NEW JERSEY directed nearly ten
thousand rounds of ammunition at Communist targets; over: 3,000
of these shells were 16-inch projectiles.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Her first Vietnam
combat tour completed, NEW JERSEY departed Subic Bay 3 April 1969
for Japan. She arrived at Yokosuka for a two-day visit, sailing
for the United States 9 April. Her homecoming, however, was to be
delayed. On the 15th, while NEW JERSEY was still at sea, North
Korean jet fighters shot down an unarmed EC-121
&quot;Constellation&quot; electronic surveillance plane over the
Sea of Japan, killing its entire crew. A carrier task force was
formed and sent to the Sea of Japan, while NEW JERSEY was ordered
to come about and steam toward Japan. On the 22nd she arrived
once more at Yokosuka, and immediately put to sea in readiness
for what might befall. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As the crisis
lessened, NEW JERSEY was released to continue her interrupted
voyage. She anchored at Long Beach 5 May 1969, her first visit to
her home port in eight months. Through the summer months, NEW
JERSEY's crew toiled to make her ready for another deployment. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Deficiencies
discovered on the gun line were remedied, as all hands looked
forward to another opportunity to prove the mighty warship's
worth in combat. Reasons of economy were to dictate otherwise. On
22 August 1969 the Secretary of Defense released a list of names
of ships to be inactivated; at the top of the list was NEW
JERSEY. Five days later, Captain Snyder was relieved of command
by Captain Robert C. Peniston.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Assuming command
of a ship already earmarked for the &quot;mothball fleet,&quot;
Captain Peniston and his crew prepared for their melancholy task.
NEW JERSEY got underway on her last voyage 6 September, departing
Long Beach for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">She arrived on the
8th, and began preinactivation overhaul to ready herself for
decommissioning. On 17 December 1969 NEW JERSEY's colors were
hauled down and she entered the inactive fleet, still echoing the
words of her last commanding officer: &quot;Rest well, yet sleep
lightly; and hear the call, if again sounded, to provide fire
power for freedom.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY was
recomissioned December 28, 1982 to serve in Carrier and
Battleship Command and Support groups, and as a Command and
Control ship. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Decomissioned
February 8, 1991, NEW JERSEY is currently (1992) part of the
Reserve Fleet at Bremerton, Washington.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NEW JERSEY earned
the Navy Unit Commendation for Vietnam service. She has received
nine battle stars for World War II; four for the Korean conflict;
and two for Vietnam.</font></p>
