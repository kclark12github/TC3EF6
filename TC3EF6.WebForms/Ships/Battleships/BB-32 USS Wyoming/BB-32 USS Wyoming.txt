The third WYOMING (Battleship No. 32) was laid down on 9 February 1910 at  
Philadelphia, Pa., by William Cramp and Sons; launched on 25 May 1911;  
sponsored by Miss Dorothy Eunice Knight, the daughter of former Chief 
Justice Jesse Knight of the Wyoming Supreme Court; and commissioned at 
the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 25 September 1912, Capt. Frederick L. Chapin 
in command.
WYOMING departed Philadelphia on 6 October and completed the fitting-out 
process at the New York Navy Yard, Brooklyn, N.Y., before she joined the 
fleet in Hampton Roads, Va. Reaching the Tidewater area on 30 December 
1912, she became the flagship of Rear  Admiral Charles J. Badger, 
Commander, United States Atlantic Fleet, soon thereafter. Sailing on 6 
January 1913, the new battleship visited the soon to be completed Panama 
Canal and then conducted winter fleet  maneuvers off Cuba before she 
returned to Chesapeake Bay on 4 March.
After gunnery practice off the Virginia capes, on the southern drill 
grounds, WYOMING underwent repairs and alterations at the New York Navy 
Yard between 18 April and 7 May. She then participated in war games off 
Block Island between 7 and 24 Maya period of activity broken by repairs to 
her machinery, carried out at Newport, R.I., between 9 and 19 May-before 
she underwent more repairs at Newport. She then visited New York City 
from 28 to 31 May for the festivities surrounding the dedication of the 
monument honoring the battleship MAINE, destroyed in Havana harbor on 15 
February 1898.
Shifting to Annapolis Md., on 4 June, WYOMING  embarked a contingent of 
Naval Academy midshipmen and took the young officers-to-be on a summer 
cruise off the coast of New England that lasted into late August. 
Disembarking the "middies" at Annapolis on 24 and 25 August, WYOMING 
then conducted torpedo and target practices in the southern drill grounds, 
out of Hampton Roads, into the late autumn. She was docked at New York 
for repairs between 16 September and 2 October and then ran a full-power 
trial as she headed south to Norfolk to resume exercises off the Virginia 
capes before sailing for Europe on 26 October.
Reaching Valletta, Malta, on 8 November, the  dreadnought-type battleship 
visited Naples, Italy, and  Villefranche, France, during the course of her  
Mediterranean cruise. The battleship then left French waters astern on the 
last day of November and reached New York on 15 December.
WYOMING then underwent voyage repairs at the New York Navy Yard 
remaining there through the end of 1913. Getting underway on 6 January 
1914, the  battleship reached Hampton Roads on the morrow and spent the 
next three days coaling to prepare for the annual fleet exercises in the 
warmer Caribbean climes.
WYOMING exercised with the fleet, out of Guantanamo Bay and Guacanayabo 
Bay, Cuba, between 26 January and 15 March, before setting her course 
northward for Cape Henry, Va. She then ranged with the fleet from the 
southern drill grounds, off the Virginia 
capes, to Tangier Sound, for gunnery drills and practices. She remained 
engaged in that routine until 3 April, when she headed for the New York 
Navy Yard and an  overhaul.
After that period of repairs, which lasted from 4 April to 9 May, WYOMING 
subsequently embarked a draft of men for transport to the fleet, departed  
Hampton Roads on 13 May, and headed for Mexican waters. She reached 
Veracruz on 18 May-less than a month after American sailors and marines 
had occupied that Mexican port.
WYOMING remained at Vera Cruz over the months that ensued, into the late 
autumn of 1914, before she returned northward. After conducting exercises 
off the Virginia capes en route, she put into the New York Navy Yard on 6 
October and then underwent repairs and alterations which lasted until 17 
January 1915.
Shifting down the coast upon completion of that yard period, WYOMING left 
Hampton Roads in her wake on 21 January for the annual exercises in Cuban 
waters
and in the Caribbean. Returning to the Tidewater area on 7 April, the 
battleship carried out tactical exercises and maneuvers along the eastern 
seaboard-primarily off Block Island and the southern drill grounds-into the 
late autumn, when she again entered the New York Navy Yard for an 
overhaul.
After repairs lasting from 20 December 1915 to 6 January 1916, WYOMING 
got underway on the latter day, bound for war games in the southern drill 
grounds. She subsequently headed farther south,  reaching Culebra, Puerto 
Rico, on 16 January. After visiting Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on 27 January, 
WYOMING put into Guantanamo Bay on the 28th and then operated in Cuban 
waters-off Guantanamo and Guacanayabo Bays and the port of Manzanillo-
until 10 April, when she sailed for New York.
WYOMING remained in the New York Navy Yard from 16 April to 26 June, 
undergoing repairs; she then operated off the New England coast, out of 
Newport, and off the Virginia capes through the remainder of 1916. 
Departing New York on 9 January 1917,  WYOMING then conducted routine 
maneuvers in the  Guantanamo Bay region through mid-March. She departed 
the Caribbean on 27 March and was off Yorktown, Va., when the United 
States entered World War I on 6 April 1917.
 Over the months that ensued, WYOMING served in  the Chesapeake Bay 
region as an engineering ship until 13 November 1917. On that day Rear 
Admiral Hugh Rodman broke his flag in NEW YORK (Battleship No. 34) as 
Commander, Battleship Division 9. After preparations for "distant service," 
WYOMING, NEW YORK, DELAWARE (Battleship No. 28), and FLORIDA  
(Battleship No. 30) sailed for the British Isles on 25 November and reached 
Scapa Flow, Orkney Islands, on 7 December 1917. Although retaining their 
American designation as Battleship Division 9, those four  dreadnoughts 
became the 6th Battle Squadron of the British Grand Fleet upon arrival in 
British waters.
WYOMING carried out maneuvers and tactical  exercises with the units of 
the British Grand Fleet until 6 February 1918. On that day, she got 
underway with the other ships of the 6th Battle Squadron and eight British 
destroyers to guard a convoy routed to Stavanger, Norway. En route, 
WYOMING dodged torpedo wakes off Stavanger, on 8 February but reached 
Scapa Flow safely two days later. In the following months, WYOMING 
continued to patrol off the British Isles, guarding the coastwise sea lanes 
against the danger posed by the still-powerful German High Seas Fleet.

Between 30 June and 2 July 1918, WYOMING operated with the 6th Battle 
Squadron and a division of British destroyers, guarding Allied minelayers 
as they Planted the North Sea Mine Barrage. Later, WYOMING returned to the 
Firth of Forth, where she was inspected by the King of England, His Majesty 
George V, along with other units of the Grand Fleet.
Although American and German capital ships never met in combat on the 
high seas, they nevertheless made rendezvous. On 21 November 1918-10 
days after the armistice ended World War IWYOMING, NEW YORK, TEXAS 
(Battleship No. 36), and ARKANSAS (Battleship No. 33) joined the Grand 
Fleet as it escorted the German High Seas Fleet into the Firth of Forth to 
be interned following the cessation of hostilities.
Later, WYOMING, hoisting the flag of Rear Admiral William S. Sims, 
Commander, Battleship Division 9, sailed on 12 December 1918 from 
Portland, England, bound for France. The following morning, she and other 
battleships rendezvoused with GEORGE WASHINGTON (Id. No. 3018 ) off 
Brest, France. Embarked in the transport was the President of the United 
States, Woodrow Wilson, enroute to the Paris Peace  Conference.
After serving in the honor escort for the President and his party, WYOMING 
returned Admiral Sims to Plymouth, England, along with the newly 
appointed ambassador to Great Britain. Debarking her  distinguished 
passengers on 14 December, the battleship loaded 381 bags of mail and, 
within a few hours, sailed for the United States. Reaching New York City on 
Christmas Day 1918, she remained there through New Year's Day 1919. On 
18 January 1919, she became the flagship of Battleship Division 7, 3d 
Squadron, and broke the flag of Rear Admiral Robert E. Coontz.
WYOMING departed New York on 1 February and, following winter maneuvers 
in Cuban waters, returned north, reaching New York on 14 April. However, 
she stood out to sea soon thereafter, getting underway on 12 May to serve 
as a link in the chain of ships  stretching across the Atlantic to guide the 
NC-boats on their flight across that ocean. After completing her duty as 
plane guard and meteorological station, WYOMING  returned to Hampton 
Roads on the last day of May.
Later embarking midshipmen and taking them on their southern cruise in 
the Chesapeake Bay-Virginia capes area, WYOMING entered the Norfolk Navy 
Yard on 1 July to prepare for service in the Pacific. On that day, she 
became a unit of the newly designated Pacific Fleet, assigned the duty as 
flagship for  Battleship Division 6, Squadron 4. On the morning of 19 July, 
the fleet, led by flagship NEW MEXICO (Battleship No. 40), got underway for 
the Pacific. Transiting the Panama Canal soon thereafter, the fleet reached 
San Diego, Calif., on 6 August.
Shifting to San Pedro, Calif.,, three days later, WYOMING operated out of 
that port into the autumn. After an overhaul at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, 
Bremerton, Wash., from 15 September 1919 to 19 April 1920, WYOMING 
returned to her base at San Pedro on 4 May. Over the next few months, the 
battleship  exercised off the southern California coast. During that time, 
she was reclassified BB-82 on 17 July 1920.
Departing San Diego on the last day of August 1920, WYOMING sailed for 
Hawaiian waters and conducted exercises and maneuvers there through 
September.  Returning to San Diego on 8 October, WYOMING  subsequently 
conducted tactical evolutions off the western seaboard, ranging north to 
Seattle. Departing San 
Francisco, Calif., on 5 January 1921, WYOMING, over the ensuing weeks, 
conducted further drills, exercises, and maneuvers reaching from Panama 
Bay to  Valparaiso, Chile, and was reviewed by the President of Chile on 8 
February. Returning north via Panama Bay and San Pedro, WYOMING arrived 
at the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 18 March and remained there into the 
summer.
Upon completion of repairs, WYOMING headed south and, on 2 August, 
reached Balboa, Canal Zone, where she embarked Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman 
and  members of the commission to Peru for transportation to New York 
City. Reaching her destination on 19 August, she disembarked her 
passengers and, that afternoon, broke the flag of Admiral Hilary P. Jones, 
the  Commander in Chief, United States Atlantic Fleet.
Over the next 41 months, WYOMING operated  primarily in the Atlantic, off 
the eastern seaboard of the United States, participating in Atlantic Fleet 
exercises, ranging from the coast of New England to the Virginia capes. She 
took part in the routine winter maneuvers of the fleet in Caribbean and 
Cuban waters, serving at various times as flagship for Vice Admiral John 
D. McDonald, Commander, Battleship Force; and, later, Commander, Scouting 
Fleet, and his successors, Vice Admiral Newton A. McCully and Vice 
Admiral Josiah S. McKean. During that time, the ship received routine 
repairs and alterations at the New York Navy Yard and conducted a 
midshipman's training cruise in the summer of 1824, cruising to Torbay, 
England;  Rotterdam, Holland; Gibraltar; and the Azores.
Departing New York on 26 January 1926, the  battleship conducted battle 
practice in Cuban waters, out of Guantanamo Bay, and then transited the 
Panama Canal on 14 February to join the Battle Fleet for exercises along 
the coast of California. WYOMING next sailed for Hawaiian waters and 
operated in those climes from late April to early June. After a visit to San 
Diego from 18 to 22 June, the battleship returned to the east coast, via the 
Panama Canal, and arrived back at New York City on 17 July to resume 
operations off the coast of New England. Following those training 
evolutions with a cruise to Cuba and Haiti, WYOMING underwent an overhaul 
at the New York Navy Yard from 23  November 1925 to 26 January 1926. 
During her yard period, Comdr. William F. Halsey, Jr., reported on board as 
the battleship's executive officer. The future fleet  admiral served in 
WYOMING until 4 January 1927.
WYOMING subsequently took part in the Fleet's  annual winter maneuvers in 
the Caribbean and then  returned northward, reaching Annapolis on 29 May 
to embark midshipmen for their summer training cruise. After touching at 
Newport, R.I.; Marblehead, Mass.; Portland, Maine; Charleston, S.C.; and 
Guantanamo Bay, WYOMING returned to Annapolis on 27 August, 
disembarking the officers-to-be upon arrival. The ship then put into the 
Philadelphia Navy Yard for  modernization.
Converted from a coal burner to an oil burner,  WYOMING also received new 
turbines, blisters for added  underwater protection against torpedoes, and 
other  alterations. Completing the overhaul on 2 November 1927 and 
heading south for Norfolk, WYOMING then  underwent a post-modernization 
shakedown cruise to Cuba and the Virgin Islands before returning to  
Philadelphia on 7 December. Two days later, she hoisted the flag of 
Commander, Scouting Fleet, Vice Admiral  Ashley H. Robertson.
Over the next few years, WYOMING operated out of Norfolk, New York, and 
Boston, making training cruises for the Naval Reserve Officers Training 
Corps (NROTC) units hailing from Yale, 
Harvard, Georgia Tech, and Northwestern. That duty took her from the Gulf 
of Mexico to Nova Scotia and into the Caribbean, as well as to the Azores. 
During the course of that duty, she departed Hampton Roads on 12 
November 1928; and, on the night of 13 and 14 November, picked up eight 
survivors of the sunken British merchant steamship VESTRIS; and landed 
them at Norfolk the following day, 16 November.
Relieved as flagship of the Scouting Force on 19  September 1930, 
WYOMING then became the flagship of Rear Admiral Wat T. Cluverius, 
Commander,  Battleship Division 2, and performed that duty until 4  
November. After then hoisting the flag of Rear Admiral H. H. Christy, 
Commander, Training Squadron,  Scouting Fleet, the battleship conducted a 
training cruise into the Gulf of Mexico, during which she visited New 
Orleans.
Returning north after that cruise, WYOMING was placed in reduced 
commission at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 1 January 1931 to prepare-for  
demilitarization and conversion to a training ship 
in accordance with the 1930 London Treaty for the limitation and  reduction 
of naval armaments. During that process, WYOMING lost her blisters, side 
armor, and the removal of guns and turret machinery from three of her six 
main battery turrets. On 21 May 1931, WYOMING was relieved of her duties 
as flagship for the Scouting Force by AUGUSTA (CA-31) and by ARKANSAS 
(BB-33) as flagship of the Training Squadron.
WYOMING subsequently visited Annapolis upon the completion of her 
demilitarization and, between 29 May and 5 June 1931, embarked Naval 
Academy midshipmen for a cruise to European waters. Sailing on 5 June, the 
ship was in the mid-Atlantic 10 days later, when she went to the aid of the 
foundering icecutting submarine NAUTILUS, commanded by the famed British 
Arctic  explorer, Sir Hubert Wilkins. WYOMING took the disabled submersible 
in tow and took her to Queenstown,  Northern Ireland. Later in the course of 
the cruise, the former battleship visited Copenhagen, Denmark; Greenock, 
Scotland; Cadiz, Spain; and Gibraltar, before she  returned to Hampton Roads 
on 13 August. During her cruise, she had been redesignated from a 
battleship, BB-32, to a miscellaneous auxiliary, AG-17, on 1 July 1931.
Over the next four years, WYOMING continued  summer practice cruises for 
Naval Academy midshipmen and training cruises for NROTC midshipmen with 
units from various universities. Her service took her throughout the 
Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as to northern European ports and 
into the Mediterranean.
However, there were new jobs for the old campaigner. On 18 January 1935, 
she embarked men of the 2d  Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment, at Norfolk, for 
the  winter-spring landing assault practices at Puerto Rico and the Panama 
Canal Zone. In almost every succeeding year, WYOMING took part in 
amphibious assault exercises, as the elements of the Fleet Marine Force and 
Navy  developed tactics for use in possible conflicts of the future.
Departing Norfolk on 5 January 1937, WYOMING transited the Panama Canal; 
headed for San Diego soon thereafter; and spent the following weeks 
engaged in assault landing exercises and gunnery drills at San Clemente 
Island, off the coast of California. On 18 February 1937, during the 
culminating phase of a multi-faceted (land, sea, and air) exercise, a 
shrapnel shell exploded prematurely as it was being rammed into one of the 
ship's 5-inch broadside guns. Six marines were killed, and 11 were wounded. 
Immediately after the explosion, WYOMING sped to 
San Pedro, where she transferred the wounded marines to the hospital ship 
RELIEF (AH-1).
Completing her slate of exercises and war games off the California coast 
on 3 March, WYOMING stood out of Los Angeles harbor on that day and 
headed back to the east coast. Returning to Norfolk on the 23d of the same 
month, the ship served as temporary flagship for Rear Admiral Wilson 
Brown, Commander, Training  Squadron, from 15 April to 3 June, during the 
preparations for the upcoming Naval Academy practice cruise.  Putting to 
sea on 4 June from Hampton Roads, WYOMING reached Kiel, Germany, on 21 
June 1937, where she was visited by officers from the ill-fated German 
"pocket battleship" ADMIRAL GRAF SPEE. Her embarked midshipmen 
subsequently toured Berlin before  WYOMING sailed for home on 29 June, 
touching at Torbay, England, and Funchal, Madeira, before returning to 
Norfolk on 3 August.
After local exercises, WYOMING disembarked her  midshipmen at Annapolis 
on 26 August. For the next few months, WYOMING continued in her role as 
training ship -first for Naval Reserve units and then for Merchant Marine 
Reserve units, ranging from Boston to the Virgin Islands and from New York 
to Cuba,  respectively, before she underwent an overhaul at the Norfolk 
Navy Yard between 16 October 1937 and 14 January 1938.
For the next three years, WYOMING continued her  operations out of Norfolk, 
Boston, and New York, visiting Cuban waters, as well as Puerto Rico and 
New Orleans. In addition, she conducted a Naval Academy  midshipman's 
practice cruise to European waters in 1938,  visiting Le Havre, France; 
Copenhagen; and Portsmouth, England. Ultimately, on 2 January 1941, 
WYOMING  became the flagship for Rear Admiral Randall Jacobs, 
Commander, Training, Patrol Force, and continued in her training ship 
duties into the autumn months.
In November 1941, WYOMING embarked on yet  another phase of her career-
that of a gunnery training ship. She departed Norfolk on 25 November 1941 
for gunnery training runs out of Newport, R.I., and was off Platt's Bank 
when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 7 
December 1941.
Putting into Norfolk on 28 January 1942, WYOMING sailed out into the 
lower reaches of Chesapeake Bay on 5 February to begin a countless chain 
of gunnery  training drills in that area that would carry her through World 
War II. So familiar was her appearance in that area that WYOMING earned 
the nickname of the  "Chesapeake Raider." Assigned to the Operational 
Training Command, United States Atlantic Fleet, the former dreadnought 
battleship provided the platform on which thousands of gunners trained in 
guns, ranging from 5-inch to .50-caliber.
Refitted at Norfolk between 12 January and 3 April 1944, WYOMING took on 
a different silhouette upon emerging from that yard period; the rest of her 
12-inch turrets were removed, and replaced with twin-mount 5-inch guns; 
in addition, newer models of fire control radars were installed. She 
resumed her gunnery  training activities on 10 April 1944, operating in the  
Chesapeake Bay region. The extent of her operations can be seen from a 
random sampling of figures; in a single month, November 1944, WYOMING 
trained 133 officers and 1,329 men in antiaircraft gunnery. During that 
month, she fired 3,033 5-inch shells, 849 3-inch; 10,076 40-millimeter; 
32,231 20 millimeter; 66,270 .30caliber; and 360 1.1-inch  ammunition. 
She claimed the distinction of firing off more ammunition that  any other 
ship in the fleet, training an estimated 35,000 gunners on some  
seven different types of guns.
On 30 June 1945, WYOMING completed her career as "Chesapeake Raider" 
when  she departed Norfolk for the New York Navy Yard and alterations. 
Leaving  the yard on 13 July 1945, she entered Casco Bay soon thereafter, 
reporting  for duty to Vice Admiral Willis A. Lee, Commander, Composite 
Task Force 69.  She fired her first experimental gunnery practice at towed 
sleeves, drone  aircraft, and radio-controlled targets, as the largest 
operating unit of the  force established to study methods and tactics for 
dealing with the Japanese  kamikazes. Subsequently, Composite Task Force 
69 became the Operational  Development Force, United States Fleet, on 31 
August 1945. Upon the death  of Admiral Lee, the reins of command passed 
to Rear Admiral R. P. Briscoe.
Even after the broadening of the scope of the work of the force to cover all  
the operational testing of new devices of fire control, WYOMING remained 
the  backbone of the unit through 1946. On 11 July 1947, WYOMING entered 
the  Norfolk Naval Shipyard and was decommissioned on 1 August 1947. Her 
men and  material were then transferred to MISSISSIPPI (AG-128) (ex-Bb-
41).
WYOMING's name was struck from the Navy list on 16 September 1947, and 
her  hulk was sold for scrapping on 30 October 1947. She was then 
delivered to  her purchaser, Lipsett, Inc., of New York City, on 5 December 
1947.
