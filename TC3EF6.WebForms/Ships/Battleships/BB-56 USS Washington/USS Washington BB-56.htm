<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The eighth
WASHINGTON (BB-56) was laid down on 14 June 1938 at the
Philadelphia Navy Yard; launched on 1 June 1940; sponsored by
Miss Virginia Marshall, of Spokane, Wash., a direct descendant of
former Chief Justice Marshall; and commissioned at the
Philadelphia Navy Yard on 15 May 1941, Capt. Howard H. J. Benson
in command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Her shakedown and
underway training ranged along the eastern seaboard and into the
Gulf of Mexico and lasted through American entry into World War
II in December 1941. Sometimes operating in company with her
sistership NORTH CAROLINA (BB-56) and the new aircraft carrier
HORNET (CV-8), Washington became the flagship for Rear Admiral
John W. Wilcox, Commander, Battleship Division (ComBatDiv) 6, and
Commander, Battleships, Atlantic Fleet.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Assigned duty as
flagship for Task Force (TF) 39 on 26 March 1942 at Portland,
Maine, Washington again flew Admiral Wilcox' flag as she sailed
for the British Isles that day. Slated to reinforce the British
Home Fleet, the battleship, together with the carrier WASP (CV-7)
and the heavy cruisers WICHITA (CA-45) and TUSCALOOSA (CA-37),
headed for Scapa Flow, the major British fleet base in the Orkney
Islands.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">While steaming
through moderately heavy seas the following day, 27 March, the
&quot;man overboard&quot; alarm sounded on board Washington, and
a quick muster revealed that Admiral Wilcox was missing.
TUSCALOOSA, 1,000 yards astern, maneuvered and dropped life buoys
while two destroyers headed for WASHINGTON's wake to search for
the missing flag officer. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Planes from WASP,
despite the foul weather, also took off to aid in the search.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Lookouts in the
destroyer WILSON (DD-408) spotted Wilcox' body in the water, face
down, some distance away, but could Not pick it up. The
circumstances surrounding Wilcox being washed overboard from his
flagship have never been fully explained to this day; one school
of thought has it that he had suffered a heart attack.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At 1228 on the,
27th, the search for Wilcox was abandoned, and command of the
task force devolved upon the next senior officer, Rear Admiral
Robert C. Giffen, whose flag flew in the cruiser WICHITA. On 4
April, the task force reached Scapa Flow, joining the British
Home Fleet under the overall command of Sir John Tovey, whose
flag flew in the battleship HMS KING GEORGE V. Washington engaged
in maneuvers and battle practice with units of the Home Fleet,
out of Scapa Flow, into late April, when TF 39 was redesignated
as TF 99 with Washington as flagship. On the 28th, the force got
underway to engage in reconnaissance for the protection of the
vital convoys running lend-lease supplies to Murmansk in the
Soviet Union.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">During those
operations, tragedy befell the group. On 1 May 1942, HMS KING
GEORGE V collided with a &quot;Tribal&quot;-class destroyer. HMS
PUNJABI, cut in two, sank quickly directly in the path of the
oncoming Washington. Compelled to pass between the halves of the
sinking destroyer, the battleship proceeded ahead, PUNJABI's
depth charges exploding beneath her hull as she passed. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Fortunately for
Washington, she suffered no major hull damage nor developed any
hull leaks from the concussion of the exploding depth charges.
She did, however, sustain damage to some of her delicate fire
control systems and radars; and a diesel oil tank suffered a
small leak.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Two destroyers,
meanwhile, picked up PUNJABI's captain, four other officers and
182 men; HMS KING GEORGE V then proceeded back to Scapa Flow for
repairs. Washington and her escorts remained at sea until 5 May,
when TF 99 put into the Icelandic port of Hvalfjordur to
provision from the supply ship MIZAR (AF12). While at
Hvalfjordur, the American and Danish ministers to Iceland called
upon Admiral Giffen and inspected his flagship on 12 May.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Task Force 99
subsequently sortied on the 15th to rendezvous with units of the
Home Fleet and returned to Scapa Flow on 3 June. The next day,
Admiral Harold R. Stark, Commander, Naval Forces, Europe, came on
board and broke his flag in WASHINGTON, establishing a temporary
administrative headquarters on board. The battleship played host
to His Majesty, King George VI, at Scapa Flow on the 7th, when
the King came on board to inspect the ship.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Soon after Admiral
Stark left WASHINGTON, the battleship resumed her operations with
the Home Fleet, patrolling part of the Allied shipping lanes
leading to Russian ports. On 14 July 1942, Admiral Giffen hauled
down his flag in the battleship at Hvalfjordur and shifted to
Wichita. That same day, WASHINGTON, with a screen of four
destroyers, upped-anchor and put to sea, leaving Icelandic waters
in her wake. She reached Gravesend Bay, N.Y. on 21 July; two days
later, she shifted to the New York Navy Yard, Brooklyn, N.Y., for
a thorough overhaul.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Upon completion of
her refit, WASHINGTON sailed for the Pacific, on 23 August,
escorted by three destroyers. Five days later, she transited the
Panama Canal and, on 14 September,, reached Nukualofa Anchorage,
Tongatabu, Tonga Island. On that day, Rear Admiral Willis A.
&quot;Ching&quot; Lee, Jr., broke his flag in Washington as
Commander, Battleship Division (BatDiv) 6, and Commander, Task
Group 12.2.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The next day, 15
September, WASHINGTON put to sea bound for a rendezvous with TF
17, the force formed around the aircraft carrier HORNET.
WASHINGTON then proceeded to Noumea, New Caledonia, and supported
the ongoing Solomons campaign, providing escort services for
various reinforcement convoys proceeding to and from Guadalcanal.
During those weeks, the battleship's principal bases of operation
were Noumea and Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">By mid-November,
the situation in the Solomons was far from good for the Allies,
who were now down to one aircraft carrierENTERPRISE (CV-6)-after
the loss of WASP in September and HORNET in October, and Japanese
surface units were subjecting Henderson Field on Guadalcanal to
heavy bombardments with disturbing regularity. Significantly,
however, the Japanese only made their moves at night, since
Allied planes controlled the skies during the day. That meant
that the Allies had to move their replenishment and reinforcement
convoys into Guadalcanal during the daylight hours.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Washington
performed those vital duties into mid-November of 1942, On 19
November, she learned that three groups of: Japanese ships-one
consisting of about 24 transports, with escort-were steaming
toward Guadalcanal. One enemy force sighted that morning was
reported as consisting of two battleships, a light cruiser, and
11 destroyers.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At sunset on the
13th, Rear Admiral Lee took Washington, SOUTH DAKOTA (BB-57), and
four destroyers and headed for Savo Islandthe scene of the
disastrous night action of 8 and 9 August-to be in position to
intercept the Japanese convoy and its covering force. Lee's
ships, designated as TF 64, reached a point about 50 miles
south-by-west from Guadalcanal late in the forenoon on the 14th
and spent much of the remainder of the day
tryingunsuccessfully-to avoid being spotted by Japanese
reconnaissance planes.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Approaching on a
northerly course, nine miles west of Guadalcanal, TF 64-reported
by the Japanese reconnaissance planes as consisting of a
battleship, a cruiser, and four destroyers-steamed in column
formation. WALKE (DD-416) led, followed by BENHAM (DD-397),
PRESTON (DD-377), GWIN (DD-433), and the two battleships,
Washington and SOUTH DAKOTA.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As the ship
steamed through the flat calm sea beneath the scattered cirrus
cumulus clouds in the night sky, WASHINGTON's radar picked up a
contact, bearing to the east of Savo Island, at 0001 on 15
November. Fifteen minutes later, at 0016, Washington opened fire
with her 16-inch main battery. The fourth battle of Savo Island
was underway.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The Japanese force
proved to be the battleship KIRISHIMA, the heavy cruisers ATAGO
and TAKAO, the light cruisers SENDAI and NAGARA, and a screen of
nine destroyers escorting four transports. Planning to conduct a
bombardment of American positions on Guadalcanal to cover the
landing of troops, the Japanese force ran head-on into Lee's TF
64.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">For the next three
minutes, WASHINGTON's 16-inchers hurled out 42 rounds, opening at
18,500 yards range, her fire aimed at the light cruiser SENDAI.
Simultaneously, the battleship's 5-inch battery was engaging
another ship also being engaged by SOUTH DAKOTA.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As gunflashes
split the night and the rumble of gunfire reverberated like
thunder off the islands nearby, Washington continued to engage
the Japanese force. Between 0025 and 0034, the ship engaged
targets at 10,000 yards range with her 5-inch battery.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Most
significantly, however, Washington soon engaged KIRISHIMA; in the
first head-to-head confrontation of battleships in the Pacific
war. In seven minutes, tracking by radar, Washington sent 75
rounds of 16-inch and 107 rounds of 5-inch at ranges from 8,400
to 12,650 yards, scoring at least nine hits with her main battery
and about 40 with her 5-inchers, silencing the enemy battleship
in short order. Subsequently, WASHINGTON's 5inch batteries went
to work on other targets spotted by her radar &quot;eyes.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battle,
however, was not all one-sided. Japanese gunfire proved
devastating to the four destroyers of TF 64, as did the dreaded
and effective &quot;long lance&quot; torpedoes. WALKE and PRESTON
both took numerous hits of all calibers and sank; BENHAM
sustained heavy damage to her bow, and GWIN sustained shell hits
aft.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">SOUTH DAKOTA had
maneuvered to avoid the burning WALKE and PRESTON but soon found
herself the target of the entire Japanese bombardment group.
Skewered by searchlight beams, SOUTH DAKOTA boomed out salvoes at
the pugnacious enemy, as did Washington which was proceeding, at
that point, to deal out severe punishment upon KIRISHIMA-one of
SOUTH DAKOTA's assailants.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">SOUTH DAKOTA, the
recipient of numerous hits, retired as Washington steamed north
to draw fire away from her crippled sister battleship and the two
crippled destroyers BENHAM and GWIN. Initially, the remaining
ships of the Japanese bombardment group gave chase to Washington
but broke off action when discouraged by the battleship's heavy
guns. Accordingly, they withdrew under cover of a smoke screen.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After Washington
Skillfully evaded torpedoes fired by the retiring Japanese
destroyers in the van of the enemy force, she joined SOUTH DAKOTA
later in the morning, shaping course for Noumea. In the
battleship action, Washington had done well and had emerged
undamaged. SOUTH DAKOTA had not emerged unscathed, however,
sustaining heavy damage to her superstructure; 38 men had died;
60 lay wounded. The Japanese had lost the battleship KIRISHIMA.
Left burning and exploding, She later had to be abandoned and
Scuttled. The other enemy casualty was the destroyer AYANAMI,
scuttled the next morning.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Washington
remained in the South Pacific theater, basing on New Caledonia
and continuing as flagship for Rear Admiral &quot;Ching&quot;
Lee. The battleship protected carrier groups and task forces
engaged in the ongoing Solomons campaign until late in April of
1943, operating principally with TF 11, which included the
repaired SARATOGA (CV-3), and with TF 16, built around
ENTERPRISE.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Washington
departed Noumea on 30 April 1943, bound for the Hawaiian Islands.
While en route, TF 16 joined up; and, together, the ships reached
Pearl Harbor on 8 May, Washington, as a unit of, and as flagship
for, TF 60, carried out battle practice in Hawaiian waters until
28 May 1943, after which time she put into the Pearl Harbor Navy
Yard for overhaul.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Washington resumed
battle practice in the Hawaiian operating area upon conclusion of
those repairs and alterations and joined a convoy on 27 July to
form Task Group (TG) 56.14, bound for the South Pacific. Detached
on 6 August, Washington reached Havannah Harbor, at Efate in the
New Hebrides, on the 7th. She then operated out of Efate until
late in October, principally engaged in battle practice and
tactics with fast carrier task forces.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Departing Havannah
Harbor on the last day of October, Washington sailed as a unit of
TG 53.2-four battleships and six destroyers. The next day the
carriers ENTERPRISE, ESSEX (CV-9), and INDEPENDENCE (CVL-22), as
well as the other screening units of TG 53.3, joined TG 53.2 and
came under Rear Admiral Lee. The ships held combined maneuvers
until 6 November, when the carriers departed the formation.
Washington, with her escorts, steamed to Viti Levu, in the Fiji
Islands, arriving on the 7th.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Four days later,
however, the battleship was again underway, with rear Admiral Lee
by that point Commander, Battleships, Pacific-embarked, in
company with other units of BatDivs 8 and 9. On the 16th, the
battlewagons and their screens joined. Rear Admiral C. A.
&quot;Baldy&quot; Pownall's TG 50.1, Rear Admiral Pownall flying
his two-starred flag in YORKTOWN (CV-10), the namesake of the
carrier lost at Midway. The combined force then proceeded toward
the Gilbert Islands to join in the daily bombings of Japanese
positions in the Gilberts and Marshalls- softening them up for
impending assault.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On the 19th, the
planes from TG 50.1 attacked Mili and Jaluit in the Marshalls,
continuing those strikes through 20 November, the day upon which
Navy, Marine, and Army forces landed on Tarawa and Makin in the
Gilberts. On the 22d, the task group sent its planes against Mili
in successive waves; subsequently, the group steamed to operate
north of Makin.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Washington
rendezvoused with other carrier groups that composed TF 50 on 25
November and, during the reorganization that followed, was
assigned to TG 50.4, the fast carrier task group under the
command of Rear Admiral Frederick C. &quot;Ted&quot; Sherman. The
carriers comprising the core of the group were BUNKER HILL
(CV-17) and Monterey (CVL-26); the battleships screening them
were ALABAMA (BB-60) and SOUTH DAKOTA. Eight destroyers rounded
out the screen.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The group operated
north of Makin, providing air, surface, and antisubmarine
protection for the unfolding unloading operations at Makin,
effective on 26 November. Enemy planes attacked the group on the
27th and 28th but were driven off without inflicting any damage
on the fast carrier task forces.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As the Gilbert
Islands campaign drew to a close, TG 50.8 was formed on 6
December, under Rear Admiral Lee, in Washington. Other ships of
that group included sistership NORTH CAROLINA (BB-56),
Massachusetts (BB-59), Indiana (BB-58), SOUTH DAKOTA, and ALABAMA
(BB-60) and the Fleet carriers BUNKER HILL and MONTEREY. Eleven
destroyers screened the heavy ships.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The group first
steamed south and west of Ocean Island to take position for the
scheduled air and surface bombardment of the island of Nauru.
Before dawn on 8 December, the carriers launched their strike
groups while the bombardment force formed in column; 135 rounds
of 16-inch fire from the six battleships fell on the enemy
installations on Nauru; and, upon completion of the shelling, the
battleships secondary batteries took their turn; two planes from
each battleship spotted the fall of shot.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After a further
period of air strikes had been flown off against Nauru, the task
group sailed for Efate, where they arrived on 12 December. On
that day, due to a change in the highest command echelons, TF 57
became TF 37.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON tarried
at Efate for less than two weeks. Underway on Christmas Day,
flying Rear Admiral Lee's flag, the battleship sailed in company
with her sistership NORTH CAROLINA and a screen of four
destroyers to conduct gunnery practice, returning to the New
Hebrides on 7 January 1944.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Eleven days later,
the battleship departed Efate for the Ellice Islands. Joining TG
37.2-carriers MONTEREY and BUNKER HILL and four destroyers en
route, Washington reached Funafuti, Ellice Islands, on 20
January. Three days later, the battleship, along with the rest of
the task group, put to sea to make rendezvous with elements of TF
58, the fast carrier task force under the overall command of Vice
Admiral Marc A. &quot;Pete&quot; Mitscher. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Becoming part of
TG 58.1, WASHINGTON screened the fast carriers in her group as
they launched air strikes on Taroa and Kwajalein in the waning
days of January 1944. WASHINGTON, together with MASSACHUSETTS and
INDIANA; left the formation with four destroyers as screen and
shelled Kwajalein Atoll on the 30th. Further air strikes followed
the next day.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 1 February,
however, misfortune reared her head; WASHINGTON, while
maneuvering in the inky darkness, rammed INDIANA as she cut
across WASHINGTON's bow while dropping out of formation to fuel
escorting destroyers. Both battleships retired for repairs;
Washington having sustained 60 feet of crumpled bow plating. Both
ships put into the lagoon at Majuro the next morning.
Subsequently, after reinforcing the damaged bow, WASHINGTON
departed Majuro on 11 February, bound for the Hawaiian Islands.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">With a temporary
bow fitted at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard, Washington continued on
for the west coast of the United States. Reaching the Puget Sound
Navy Yard, Bremerton, Wash., the battleship received a new bow
over the weeks that followed her arrival. Joining BatDiv 4 at
Port Townsend, Wash., WASHINGTON embarked 500 men as passengers
and sailed for Pearl Harbor, reaching her destination on 13 June
and disembarking her passengers.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Arriving back at
Majuro on 30 May, Washington again flew Admiral Lee's flag as he
shifted on board the battleship soon after her arrival. Lee, now
a vice admiral, rode in the battleship as she headed out to sea
again, departing Majuro on 7 June and joining Mitscher's fast
carrier TF 58.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Washington
supported the air strikes pummeling enemy defenses in the
Marianas on the islands of Saipan, Tinian, Guam, Rota, and Pagan.
Task Force 58's fliers also attacked twice and damaged a Japanese
convoy in the vicinity on 12 June. The following day, Vice
Admiral Lee's battleship-destroyer task group was detached from
the main body of the force and conducted shore bombardment
against enemy installations on Saipan and Tinian. Relieved on the
14th by two task groups under Rear Admirals J. B. Oldendorf and
W. L. Ainsworth, Vice Admiral Lee's group retired momentarily.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 16 June,
Admiral Mitscher's TF 58 planes bombed Japanese installations on
Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands and Chichi Jima and Haha Jima in
the Bonins. Meanwhile, marines landed on Saipan under cover of
intensive naval gunfire and carrier-based planes.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">That same day,
Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa, commanding the main body of the Japanese
Fleet, was ordered to attack and destroy the invasion force in
the Marianas. The departure of his carrier group, however, came
under the scrutiny of the submarine REDFIN (SS-272), as it left
Tawi Tawi, the westernmost island in the Sulu Archipelago.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">FLYING FISH
(SS-229) also sighted Ozawa's force as it entered the Philippine
Sea. CAVALLA (SS-244) radioed a contact report on an enemy
refueling group on 16 June and continued tracking it as it headed
for the Marianas. She again sighted Japanese Combined Fleet units
on 18 June.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Admiral Raymond A.
Spruance, commanding the 6th Fleet, had meanwhile learned of the
Japanese movement and accordingly issued his battle plan. Vice
Admiral Lee's force formed a protective screen around the vital
fleet carriers. Washington, six other battleships, four heavy
cruisers, and 14 destroyers deployed to cover the flattops; on 19
June, the ships came under attack from Japanese carrier-based and
land-based planes as the Battle of the Philippine Sea commenced.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The tremendous
firepower of the screen, however, together with the aggressive
combat air patrols flown from the American carriers, proved too
much for even the aggressive Japanese. The heavy loss of Japanese
aircraft, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Marianas Turkey
Shoot,&quot; caused serious losses in the Japanese naval air arm.
During four massive raids, the enemy launched 373 planes-only 130
returned.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In addition, 50
land-based bombers from Guam fell in flames. Over 930 American
carrier planes were involved in the aerial action; their losses
amounted to comparatively few: 29 shot down and six lost
operationally without the loss of a single ship in Mitscher's
task force.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Only a few of the
enemy planes managed to get through the barrage of flak and
fighters, one scoring a direct hit on SOUTH DAKOTA-killing 27 and
wounding 29. A bomb burst over the flight deck of the carrier
WASP (CV-18), killing one man, wounding 12, and covering her
flight deck with bits of phosphorus. Two planes dove on BUNKER
HILL, one scoring a near miss and the other a hit that holed an
elevator, knocking out the hanger deck gasoline system
temporarily; killing three and wounding 79. Several fires started
were promptly quenched. In addition, MINNEAPOLIS (CA-36) and
INDIANA also received slight damage.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Not only did the
Japanese lose heavily in planes; two of their carriers were soon
on their way to the bottom-TAIHO, torpedoed and sunk by ALBACORE
(SS-218); and SHOKAKU, sunk by CAVALLA. Admiral Ozawa, his
flagship, TAIHO, sunk out from under him, transferred his flag to
ZUIKAKU. [With the sinking of SHOKAKU, ZUIKAKU becomes the last
of the six carriers that attacked Pearl Harbor to remain afloat.
The first four, AKAGI, KAGA, SORYU, and HIRYU, were sunk at the
battle of Midway. ZUIKAKU will survive until sacrificed as a
diversion at the battle of Leyte Gulf, 25 Oct., 1944. LWJ]</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As the Battle of
the Philippine Sea proceeded to a close, the Japanese Mobile
Fleet steamed back to its bases, defeated. Admiral Mitscher's
task force meanwhile retired to cover the invasion operations
proceeding in the Marianas. Washington fueled east of that chain
of islands and then continued her screening duties with TG 58.4
to the south and west of Saipan, supporting the continuing air
strikes on islands in the Marianas, the strikes concentrated on
Guam by that point.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 25 July,
aircraft of TG 58.4 conducted air strikes on the Palaus and on
enemy shipping in the vicinity, continuing their schedule of
strikes through 6 August. On that day, WASHINGTON, with IOWA
(BB-61), INDIANA, ALABAMA, the light cruiser BIRMINGHAM (CL-62),
and a destroyer screen, was detached from the screen of TG 58.4,
forming TG 58.7, under Vice Admiral Lee.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">That group arrived
at Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshalls to refuel and replenish on 11
August and remained there for almost the balance of the month. On
30 August, that group departed, headed for, first, the Admiralty
Islands, and ultimately, the Palaus.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON's heavy
guns supported the taking of Peleliu and Angaur in the Palaus and
supported the carrier strikes on Okinawa on 10 October, on
northern Luzon and Formosa from 11 to 14 October, as well as the
Visayan air strikes on 21 October. From 5 November 1944 to 17
February 1946, Washington, as a vital unit of the fast carrier
striking forces, supported raids on Okinawa, in the Ryukyus;
Formosa; Luzon; Camranh Bay, French Indochina; Saigon, French
Indochina; Hong Kong; Canton; Hainan Island; Nansei Shoto; and
the heart of the enemy homeland-Tokyo itself.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">From 19 to 22
February 1945, WASHINGTON's heavy rifles hurled 16-inch shells
shoreward in support of the landings on Iwo Jima. In preparation
for the assault WASHINGTON's main and secondary batteries
destroyed gun positions, troop concentrations, and other ground
installations. From 23 February to 16 March, the fast battleship
supported the unfolding invasion of Iwo Jima, including a carrier
raid upon Tokyo on 25 February. On 18, 19, and 29 March,
Washington screened the Fleet's carriers as they launched
airstrikes against Japanese airfields and other installations on
the island of Kyushu. On 24 March, and again on 19 April,
Washington lent her support to the shellings of Japanese
positions on the island of Okinawa.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Anchoring at San
Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 1 June 1945 after an almost ceaseless slate
of operations, Washington sailed for the west coast of the United
States on 6 June, making stops at Guam and Pearl Harbor before
reaching the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 28 June.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As it turned out,
Washington would not participate in active combat in the Pacific
theater again. Her final wartime refit carried on through V-J Day
in mid-August of 1945 and the formal Japanese surrender in Tokyo
Bay on 2 September. She completed her post-repair trials and
conducted underway training out of San Pedro, Calif., before she
headed for the Panama Canal, returning to, the Atlantic Ocean.
Joining TG 11.6 on 6 October, with Vice Admiral Frederick C.
Sherman in overall command, she soon transited the Panama Canal
and headed for Philadelphia, the place where she had been
&quot;born.&quot; Arriving at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on
17 October, she participated in Navy Day ceremonies there on the
27th.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Assigned to troop
transport duty on 2 November 1945-as part of the &quot;Magic
Carpet&quot; operations Washington went into dockyard hands on
that day, emerging on the 15th with additional bunking facilities
below and a crew that now consisted of only 84 officers and 835
men. Sailing on 16 November for the British Isles, Washington
reached Southampton, England, on 22 November. After embarking 185
army officers and 1,479 enlisted men, Washington sailed for New
York. She completed that voyage and, after that brief stint as a
transport, was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 27 June
1947. Assigned to the New York group of the Atlantic Reserve
Fleet, WASHINGTON remained inactive through the late 1950's,
ultimately being struck from the Navy list on 1 June, 1960. The
old warrior was sold on 24 May 1961, and was scrapped soon
thereafter.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WASHINGTON (BB-56)
earned 13 battle stars during World War II in operations that had
carried her from the Arctic Circle to the western Pacific.</font></p>
