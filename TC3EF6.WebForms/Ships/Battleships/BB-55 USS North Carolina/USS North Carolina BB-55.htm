<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The third NORTH
CAROLINA (BB-55) was laid down 27 October 1937 by New York Naval
Shipyard; launched 13 June 1940 sponsored by Miss Isabel Hoey,
daughter of Governor of North Carolina; and commissioned at New
York 9 April 1941, Captain Olaf M. Hustvedt in command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">First commissioned
of the Navy's modern battleships, NORTH CAROLINA received so much
attention during her fitting out and trials that she won the
enduring nickname &quot;Show boat&quot;. NORTH CAROLINA completed
her shakedown in the Caribbean prior to the Pearl Harbor attack,
and after intensive war exercises, entered the Pacific 10 June
1942.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NORTH CAROLINA and
the Navy began the long island-hopping campaign for victor over
the Japanese by landing marines on Guadalcanal and Tulagi 7
August 1942. After screening ENTERPRISE (CV-6) in the Au Support
Force for the invasion, NORTH CAROLINA guarded the carrier during
operations protecting supply and communication lines southeast of
the Solomons. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Enemy carriers
were located 24 August, and the Battle of the Eastern Solomons
erupted. The Americans struck first, sinking carrier RYUJO;
Japanese retaliation came as bombers and torpedo planes, covered
by fighters, roared in on ENTERPRISE and NORTH CAROLINA. In an
8-minute action, NORTH CAROLINA shot down between 7 and 14 enemy
aircraft, her gunners standing to their guns despite the jarring
detonation of 7 near-misses. One man was killed by a strafer, but
the ship was undamaged. The protection NORTH CAROLINA could offer
ENTERPRISE was limited as the speedy carrier drew ahead of her.
ENTERPRISE took three direct hits while her aircraft severely
damaged sea-plane carrier CHITOSE and hit other Japanese ships.
Since the Japanese lost about 100 aircraft in this action, the
United States won control of the air and averted a threatened
Japanese reinforcement of Guadalcanal.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NORTH CAROLINA now
gave her mighty strength to protect SARATOGA (CV-3). Twice during
the following weeks of support to marines ashore on Guadalcanal,
NORTH CAROLINA was attacked by Japanese submarines. On 6
September, she maneuvered successfully, dodging a torpedo which
passed 300 yards off the port beam. Nine days later, sailing with
HORNET (CV-8), NORTH CAROLINA took a torpedo portside, 20 feet
below her waterline, and 6 of her men were killed. But skillful
damage control by her crew and the excellence of her construction
prevented disaster; a 5.6 degree list was righted in as many
minutes, and she maintained her station in a formation at 26
knots.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After repairs at
Pearl Harbor, NORTH CAROLINA screened ENTERPRISE and SARATOGA and
covered supply and troop movements in the Solomons for much of
the next year. She was at Pearl Harbor in March and April 1943 to
receive advanced fire control and radar gear, and again in
September, to prepare for the Gilbert Islands operation.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">With ENTERPRISE,
in the Northern Covering Group, NORTH CAROLINA sortied from Pearl
Harbor 10 November for the assault on Makin, Tarawa, and Abemama.
Air strikes began 19 November, and for 10 days mighty air blows
were struck to aid marines ashore engaged in some of the
bloodiest fighting of the Pacific War. Supporting the Gilberts
campaign and preparing the assault on the Marshalls, NORTH
CAROLINA's highly accurate big guns bombarded Nauru 8 December,
destroying air facilities, beach defense revetments, and radio
installations. Later that month, she protected BUNKER HILL
(CV-17) in strikes against shipping and airfields at Kavieng, New
Ireland and in January 1944 joined Fast Carrier Striking Force
68, Rear Admiral Marc Mitscher in command, at Funafuti, Ellice
Islands.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">During the assault
and capture of the Marshall Islands, NORTH CAROLINA illustrated
the classic battleship functions of World War II. She screened
carriers from air attack in preinvasion strikes as well as during
close air support of troops ashore, beginning with the initial
strikes on Kwajalein 29 January. She fired on targets at Namur
and Roi, where she sank a cargo ship in the lagoon. The
battlewagon then protected carriers in the massive air strike on
Truk, the Japanese fleet base in the Carolines, where 39 large
ships were left sunk, burning, or uselessly beached, and 211
planes were destroyed, another 104 severely damaged. Next she
fought off an air attack against the flattops near the Marianas
21 February splashing an enemy plane, and the next day again
guarded the carriers in air strikes on Saipan Tinian, and Guam.
During much of this period she was flagship for Rear Admiral
(later Vice Admiral) Willis A. Lee, Jr., Commander Battle-ships
Pacific.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">With Majuro as her
base, NORTH CAROLINA joined in the attacks on Palau and Woleai 31
March-1 April, shooting down another enemy plane during the
approach phase. On Woleai, 150 enemy aircraft were destroyed
along with ground installations. Support for the capture of the
Hollandia area of New Guinea followed (13-24 April); then another
major raid on Truk (29-30 April), during which NORTH CAROLINA
splashed yet another enemy aircraft. At Truk, NORTH CAROLINA's
planes were catapulted to rescue an American aviator downed off
the reef. After one plane had turned over on landing and the
other, having rescued all the airmen, had been unable to take off
with so much weight, Tang (SS-306) saved all involved. The next
day NORTH CAROLINA destroyed coast defense guns, antiaircraft
batteries, and airfields at Ponape. The battleship then sailed to
repair her rudder at Pearl Harbor.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Returning to
Majuro, NORTH CAROLINA sortied with the ENTERPRISE group 6 June
for the Marianas. During the assault on Saipan, NORTH CAROLINA
not only gave her usual protection to the carriers, but starred
in bombardments on the west coast of Saipan covering minesweeping
operations, and blasted the harbor at Tanapag, sinking several
small craft and destroying enemy ammunition, fuel, and supply
dumps. At dusk on invasion day, 15 June, the battleship downed
one of the only two Japanese aircraft able to penetrate the
combat air patrol.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 18 June, NORTH
CAROLINA cleared the islands with the carriers to confront the
Japanese 1st Mobile Fleet, tracked by submarines and aircraft for
the previous four days. Next day began the Battle of the
Philippine Sea, and she took station in the battle line that
fanned out from the carriers. American aircraft succeeded in
downing most of the Japanese raiders before they reached the
American ships, and NORTH CAROLINA shot down two of the few which
got trough.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On that day and
the next American air and submarine attacks, with the fierce
antiaircraft fire of such ships as NORTH CAROLINA, virtually
ended any future threat from Japanese naval aviation: three
carriers were sunk, two tankers damaged so badly they were
scuttled, and all but 36 of the 430 planes with which the
Japanese had begun the battle were destroyed. The loss of trained
aviators was irreparable, as was the loss of skilled aviation
maintenance men in the carriers. Not one American ship was lost,
and only a handful of American planes failed to return to their
carriers.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After supporting
air operations in the Marianas for another two weeks, NORTH
CAROLINA sailed for overhaul at Puget Sound Navy Yard. She
rejoined the carriers off Ulithi 7 November as a furious typhoon
struck the group. The ships fought through the storm and carried
out air strikes against western Leyte, Luzon, and the Visayas to
support the struggle for Leyte. During similar strikes later in
the month, NORTH CAROLINA fought off her first kamikaze attack.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As the pace of
operations in the Philippines intensified, NORTH CAROLINA guarded
carriers while their planes kept the Japanese aircraft on Luzon
airfields from interfering with the invasion convoys which
assaulted Mindoro 15 December. Three days later the task force
again sailed through a violent typhoon, which capsized several
destroyers. With Ulithi now her base, NORTH CAROLINA screened
wide-ranging carrier strikes on Formosa, the coast of Indo-China
and China, and the Ryukyus in January, and similarly supported
strikes on Honshu the next month. Hundreds of enemy aircraft were
destroyed which might otherwise have resisted the assault on Iwo
Jima, where NORTH CAROLINA bombarded and provided call fire for
the assaulting Marines through 22 February.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Strikes on targets
in the Japanese home islands laid the groundwork for the Okinawa
assault, in which NORTH CAROLINA played her dual role, of
bombardment and carrier screening. Here, on 6 April, she downed
three kamikazes, but took a 5-inch hit from a friendly ship
during the melee of antiaircraft fire. Three men were killed and
44 wounded. Next day came the last desperate sortie of the
Japanese Fleet, as Yamato, the largest battleship in the world,
came south with her attendants. Yamato, a cruiser, and a
destroyer were sunk, three other destroyers damaged so badly that
they were scuttled, and the remaining four destroyers returned to
the fleet base at Sasebo badly damaged. On the same day NORTH
CAROLINA splashed an enemy plane, and she shot down two more 17
April.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After overhaul at
Pearl Harbor, NORTH CAROLINA rejoined the carriers for a month of
air strikes and naval bombardment on the Japanese home islands.
Along with guarding the carriers, NORTH CAROLINA fired on major
industrial plants near Tokyo, and her scout plane pilots
performed a daring rescue of a downed carrier pilot under heavy
fire in Tokyo Bay.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NORTH CAROLINA
sent both sailors and members of her Marine Detachment ashore for
preliminary occupation duty in Japan immediately at the close of
the war, and patrolled off the coast until anchoring in Tokyo Bay
5 September to reembark her men. Carrying passengers from
Okinawa, NORTH CAROLINA sailed for home reaching the Panama Canal
8 October. She anchored at Boston 17 October, and after overhaul
at New York exercised in New England waters and carried Naval
Academy midshipmen for a summer training cruise in the Caribbean.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After
inactivation, she decommissioned at New York 27 June 1947. Struck
from the Navy List 1 June 1960, NORTH CAROLINA was transferred to
the people of North Carolina 6 September 1961. On 29 April 1962
she was dedicated at Wilmington, N.C., as a memorial to North
Carolinans of all services killed in World War II. Here
splendidly maintained and most appropriately displayedincluding a
spectacular &quot;sound and light&quot;
presentation&quot;Showboat&quot; still serves mightily to
strengthen and inspire the nation.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">NORTH CAROLINA
received 12 battle stars for World War II service.</font></p>
