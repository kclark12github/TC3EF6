<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The third ARKANSAS
(Battleship No. 33) was laid down on 25 January 1910 at Camden,
N.J., by the New York Shipbuilding Co.; launched on 14 January
1911; sponsored by Miss Nancy Louise Macon; and commissioned at
the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 17 September 1912, Capt. Roy C.
Smith in command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The new battleship
took part in a fleet review by President William H. Taft in the
Hudson River off New York City on 14 October, and received a
visit from the Chief Executive that day. She then transported
President Taft to the Panama Canal Zone for an inspection of the
unfinished isthmian waterway. After putting the inspection party
ashore, ARKANSAS sailed to Cuban waters for shakedown training.
She then returned to the Canal Zone on 26 December to carry
President Taft to Key West, Fla.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Following this
assignment, ARKANSAS joined the Atlantic Fleet for maneuvers
along the east coast. The battleship began her first overseas
cruise in late October 1913, and visited several ports in the
Mediterranean. At Naples, Italy, on 11 November 1913, the ship
celebrated the birthday of the King of Italy.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Earlier in October
1913, a coup in Mexico had brought to power a dictator,
Victoriano Huerta. The way in which Huerta had come to power,
however, proved contrary to the idealism of President Woodrow
Wilson, who insisted on a representative government, rather than
a dictatorial one, south of the American-Mexican border. Mexico
had been in turmoil for several years, and the United States Navy
maintained a force of ships in those waters ready to protect
American lives.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In a situation
where tension exists between two powers, incidents are bound to
occur. One such occurred at Tampico in the spring of 1914, and
although the misunderstanding was quickly cleared up locally, the
prevailing state of tension produced an explosive situation.
Learning that a shipment of arms for Huerta was due to arrive at
Veracruz, President Wilson ordered the Navy to prevent the
landing of the guns by seizing the customs house at that port.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">While a naval
force under Rear Admiral Henry T. Mayo was already present in
Mexican waters, the President directed that the Atlantic Fleet,
under Rear Admiral Charles J. Badger, proceed to Veracruz.
ARKANSAS participated in the landings at Veracruz, contributing a
battalion of four companies of bluejackets, a total of 17
officers and 313 enlisted men under the command of Lt. Comdr.
Arthur B. Keating. Among the junior officers was Lt. (jg.) Jonas
H. Ingram, who would be awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism at
Veracruz, as would Lt. John Grady, who commanded the artillery of
the 2d Seaman Regiment.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Landing on 22
April, ARKANSAS's men took part in the slow, methodical street
fighting that eventually secured the city. Two ARKANSAS sailors,
Ordinary Seamen Louis O. Fried and William L. Watson, died of
their wounds on 22 April. ARKANSAS's battalion returned to the
ship on 30 April, and the ship remained in Mexican waters through
the summer before setting course on 30 September to return to the
east coast. During her stay at Veracruz, she received calls from
Capt. Franz von Papen, the German military attache to the United
States and Mexico, and Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock, on 10
and 30 May 1914, respectively.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleship
reached Hampton Roads, Va., on 7 October, and after a week of
exercises, ARKANSAS sailed to the New York Navy Yard, for repairs
and alterations. She then returned to the Virginia Capes area for
maneuvers on the Southern Drill Grounds. On 12 December, ARKANSAS
returned to the New York Navy Yard for further repairs.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">She was underway
again on 16 January 1915, and returned to the Southern Drill
Grounds for exercises there from 19 to 21 January. Upon
completion of these, ARKANSAS sailed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for
fleet exercises. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Returning to
Hampton Roads on 7 April, the battleship began another training
period in the Southern Drill Grounds. On 23 April, she headed to
the New York Navy Yard for a two-month repair period. ARKANSAS
then left New York on 25 June bound for Newport, R.I. She
conducted torpedo practice and tactical maneuvers in Narragansett
Bay through late August.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Returning to
Hampton Roads on 27 August, the battleship engaged in maneuvers
in the Norfolk area through 4 October, then sailed once again to
Newport. There, ARKANSAS carried out strategic exercises from 5
to 14 October. On 15 October, the battleship arrived at the New
York Navy Yard for drydocking. Underway on 8 November, she
returned to Hampton Roads. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After a period of
routine operations, ARKANSAS went back to Brooklyn for repairs on
19 October. The ship sailed on 5 January 1916 for Hampton Roads.
Pausing there only briefly, ARKANSAS pushed on to the Caribbean
for winter maneuvers.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">She visited the
West Indies and Guantanamo Bay before returning to the United
States on 12 March for torpedo practice off Mobile Bay. The
battleship then steamed back to Guantanamo Bay on 20 March and
remained there until mid-April. On 15 April, the battleship was
once again at the New York Navy Yard for overhaul.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 6 April 1917,
the United States entered World War I on the side of the Allied
and Associated Powers. The declaration of war found ARKANSAS
attached to Battleship Division 7 and patrolling the York River
in Virginia. For the next 14 months, ARKANSAS carried out patrol
duty along the east coast and trained gun crews for duty on armed
merchantmen. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In July 1918,
ARKANSAS received orders to proceed to Rosyth, Scotland to
relieve DELAWARE (Battleship No. 28). ARKANSAS sailed on 14 July.
On the eve of her arrival in Scotland, the battleship opened fire
on what was believed to be the periscope wake of a German U-boat.
Her escorting destroyers dropped depth charges, but scared no
hits. ARKANSAS then proceeded without incident and dropped anchor
at Rosyth on 28 July.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Throughout the
remaining three and one-half months of war, ARKANSAS and the
other American battleships in Rosyth operated as part of the
British Grand Fleet as the 6th Battle Squadron.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The armistice
ending World War I became effective on 11 November. The 6th
Battle Squadron and other Royal Navy units sailed to a point some
40 miles east of May Island at the entrance of the Firth of
Forth. ARKANSAS was present at the internment of the German High
Seas Fleet in the Firth of Forth on 21 November 1918.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The American
battleships were detached from the British Grand Fleet on 1
December. From the Firth of Forth, ARKANSAS sailed to Portland,
England, thence out to sea to meet the transport GEORGE
WASHINGTON, with President Wilson on board. ARKANSASalong with
other American battleships-escorted the President's ship into
Brest, France, on 13 December 1918. From that French port,
ARKANSAS sailed to New York City, where she arrived on 26
December to a tumultuous welcome. Secretary of the Navy Josephus
Daniels reviewed the assembled battleship fleet from the yacht
MAYFLOWER.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Following an
overhaul the Norfolk Navy Yard, ARKANSAS joined the fleet in
Cuban waters for winter maneuvers. Soon thereafter, the
battleship got underway to cross the Atlantic. On 12 May 1919,
she reached Plymouth, England; thence she headed back out in the
Atlantic to take weather observations on 19 May and act as a
reference vessel for the flight of the Navy Curtiss (NC) flying
boats from Trepassey Bay, Newfoundland, to Europe.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Her role in that
venture competed, ARKANSAS proceeded thence to Brest, where she
embarked Admiral William S. Benson, the Chief of Naval
Operations, and his wife, on 10 June, upon the admiral's return
from the Peace Conference in Paris, before departing for New
York. She arrived on 20 June 1919.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ARKANSAS sailed
from Hampton Roads on 19 July 1919, assigned to the Pacific
Fleet. Proceeding via the Panama Canal, the battleship steamed to
San Francisco, where, on 6 September 1919, she embarked Secretary
of the Navy and Mrs. Josephus Daniels. Disembarking the Secretary
and his wife at Blakely Harbor, Wash., on the 12th, ARKANSAS was
reviewed by President Wilson on the 13th, the Chief Executive
having embarked in the famed OREGON (Battleship No. 3). On 19
September 1919, ARKANSAS entered the Puget Sound Navy Yard for a
general overhaul. Resuming her operations with the fleet in May
1920, ARKANSAS operated off the California coast. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 17 July 1920,
ARKANSAS received the designation BB-33 as the ships of the fleet
received alphanumeric designations. That September, she cruised
to Hawaii for the first time. Early in 1921, the battleship
visited Valparaiso, Chile, manning the rail in honor of the
Chilean president.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ARKANSAS's
peacetime routine consisted of an annual cycle of training
interspersed with periods of upkeep or overhaul. The battleship's
schedule also included competitions in gunnery and engineering
and an annual fleet problem. Becoming flagship for the Commander,
Battleship Force, Atlantic Fleet, in the summer of 1921, ARKANSAS
began operations off the east coast that August.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">For a number of
years, ARKANSAS was detailed to take midshipmen from the Naval
Academy on their summer cruises. In 1923, the battleship steamed
to Europe, visiting Copenhagen, Denmark (where she was visited by
the King of Denmark on 2 July 1923); Lisbon, Portugal; and
Gibraltar. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ARKANSAS conducted
another midshipman training cruise to European waters the
following year, 1924. In 1925, the cruise was to the west coast
of the United States. During this time, on 30 June 1925, ARKANSAS
arrived at Santa Barbara, Calif. in the wake of an earthquake.
The battleship, along with MCCAWLEY (DD-276) and EAGLE 34 (PE34)
landed a patrol of bluejackets for policing Santa Barbara, and
established a temporary radio station ashore for the transmission
of messages.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Upon completion of
the 1925 midshipman cruise, ARKANSAS entered the Philadelphia
Navy Yard for modernization. Her coal- burning boilers were
replaced with oil-fired ones. Additional deck armor was
installed, a single stack was substituted for the original pair,
and the after cage mast was replaced by a low tripod. ARKANSAS
left the yard in November 1926 and, after a shake- down cruise
along the eastern seaboard and to Cuban waters, returned to
Philadelphia to run acceptance trials. Resuming her duty with the
fleet soon thereafter, she operated from Maine to the Caribbean;
on 5 September 1927, she was present at ceremonies unveiling a
memorial tablet honoring the French soldiers and sailors who died
during the campaign at Yorktown in 1781.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In May 1928,
ARKANSAS again embarked midshipmen for their practice cruise
along the eastern seaboard and down into Cuban waters. During the
first part of 1929, she operated near the Canal Zone and in the
Caribbean, returning in May 1929 to the New York Navy Yard for
overhaul. After embarking midshipmen at Annapolis, ARKANSAS
carried out her 1929 practice cruise to Mediterranean and English
waters, returning in August to operate with the Scouting Fleet
off the east coast.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In 1930 and 1931,
ARKANSAS was again detailed to carry out midshipmen's practice
cruises; in the former year she visited Cherbourg, France; Kiel,
Germany; Oslo, Norway; and Edinburgh, Scotland; in the latter her
itinerary included Copenhagen, Denmark; Greenock, Scotland; and
Cadiz, Spain, as well as Gibraltar. In September 1991, the ship
visited Halifax, Nova Scotia. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In October
ARKANSAS participated in the Yorktown Sesquicentennial
celebrations, embarking President Herbert Hoover and his party on
17 October and taking them to the exposition. She later
transported the Chief Executive and his party back to Annapolis
on 19 and 20 October. Upon her return, the battleship entered the
Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she remained until January 1932.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Upon leaving the
navy yard, ARKANSAS sailed for the west coast, calling at New
Orleans, La., en route, to participate in the Mardi Gras
celebration. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Assigned duty as
flagship of the Training Squadron, Atlantic Fleet, ARKANSAS
operated continuously on the west coast of the United States into
the spring of 1994, at which time she returned to the east coast.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In the summer of
1934, the battleship conducted a midshipman practice cruise to
Plymouth, England; Nice, France; Naples, Italy, and to Gibraltar,
returning to Annapolis in August; proceeding thence to Newport,
R. I., where she manned the rail for President Franklin D
Roosevelt as he passed on board the yacht NOURMALHAL, and was
present for the International Yacht Race. ARKANSAS' cutter
defeated the cutter from the British light cruiser HMS Dragon for
the Battenberg Cup, and the City of Newport Cup.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In January 1935,
ARKANSAS transported the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, to Culebra
for a fleet landing exercise, and in June conducted a midshipman
practice cruise to Europe, visiting Edinburgh, Oslo (where King
Haakon VII of Norway visited the ship), Copenhagen, Gibraltar and
Funchal on the island of Madeira. After disembarking Naval
Academy midshipmen at Annapolis in August 1935, ARKANSAS
proceeded to New York. There she embarked reservists from the New
York area and conducted a Naval Reserve cruise to Halifax, Nova
Scotia in September. Upon completion of that duty, she under went
repairs and alterations at the New York Navy Yard that October.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In January 1936,
ARKANSAS participated in Fleet Landing Exercise No. 2 at Culebra,
and then visited New Orleans for the Mardi Gras festivities
before she returned to Norfolk for a navy yard overhaul which
lasted through the spring of 1996. That summer she carried out a
midshipman training cruise to Portsmouth, England; Goteborg,
Sweden; and Cherbourg, before she returned to Annapolis that
August. Steaming thence to Boston, the battleship conducted a
Naval Reserve training cruise before putting into the Norfolk
Navy Yard for an overhaul that October.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The following
year, 19937, saw ARKANSAS make a midshipman practice cruise to
European waters, visiting ports in Germany and England, before
she returned to the east coast of the United States for local
operations out of Norfolk. During the latter part of the year,
the ship also ranged from Philadelphia and Boston to St., Thomas,
Virgin Islands, and Cuban waters. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">During 1938 and
1939, the pattern of operations largely remained as it had been
in previous years, her duties in the Training Squadron largely
confining her to the waters of the eastern seaboard.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The outbreak of
war in Europe in September 1939 found ARKANSAS at Hampton Roads,
preparing for a Naval Reserve cruise. She soon got underway and
transported seaplane mooring and aviation equipment from the
naval air station at Norfolk to Narragansett Bay for the seaplane
base that was to be established there. While at Newport, ARKANSAS
took on board ordnance material for destroyers and brought it
back to Hampton Roads.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ARKANSAS departed
Norfolk on 11 January 1940, in company with TEXAS (BB-35) and NEW
YORK (BB-34), and proceeded thence to Guantanamo Bay for fleet
exercises. She then participated in landing exercises at Culebra
that February, returning via St. Thomas and Culebra to Norfolk.
Following an overhaul at the Norfolk Navy Yard (18 March to 24
May), ARKANSAS shifted to the Naval Operating Base (NOB),
Norfolk, where she remained until 30 May. Sailing on that day for
Annapolis, the battleship, along with TEXAS and NEW YORK,
conducted a midshipman training cruise to Panama and Venezuela
that summer. Before the year was out, ARKANSAS would conduct
three V-7 Naval Reserve training cruises, these voyages taking
her to Guantanamo Bay, the Canal Zone, and Chesapeake Bay.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Over the months
that followed, the United States gradually edged toward war in
the Atlantic; early the following summer, after the decision to
occupy Iceland bad been reached, ARKANSAS accompanied the initial
contingent of marines to that place. That battleship, along with
New York, and the light cruiser BROOKLYN (CL-40) provided the
heavy escort for the convoy. Following this assignment, ARKANSAS
sailed to Casco Bay Maine, and was present there when the
Atlantic Charter conferences took place on board AUGUSTA (CA-31)
between President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill. During the conference, the battleship
provided accommodations for the Under Secretary of State, Sumner
Welles, and Mr. Averell Harriman from 8 to 14 August 1941.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The outbreak of
war with the Japanese attack upon the Pacific Fleet at Pearl
Harbor found ARKANSAS at anchor in Casco Bay, Maine. One week
later, on 14 December, she sailed to Hvalfjordur, Iceland.
Returning to Boston, via Argentia, on 24 January 1942, ARKANSAS
spent the month of February carrying out exercises in Casco Bay
in preparation for her role as an escort for troop and cargo
transports. On 6 March, she arrived at Norfolk to begin overhaul.
Underway on 2 July, ARKANSAS conducted shakedown in Chesapeake
Bay, then proceeded to New York City, where she arrived on 27
July.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleship
sailed from New York on 6 August, bound for Greenock, Scotland.
Two days later, the ships paused at Halifax, Nova Scotia, then
continued on through the stormy North Atlantic. The convoy
reached Greenock on the 17th, and ARKANSAS returned to New York
on 4 September. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">She escorted
another Greenock-bound convoy across the Atlantic, then arrived
back at New York on 20 October. With the Allied invasion of North
Africa, American convoys were routed to Casablanca to support the
operations. Departing New York on 3 November, ARKANSAS covered a
troop convoy to Morocco, and returned to New York on 11 December
for overhaul.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 2 January 1943,
ARKANSAS sailed to Chesapeake Bay for gunnery drills. She
returned to New York on 30 January and began loading supplies for
yet another transatlantic trip. The battleship made two runs
between Casablanca and New York City from February through April.
In early May, ARKANSAS was drydocked at the New York Navy Yard,
emerging from that period of yard work to proceed to Norfolk on
26 May.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ARKANSAS assumed
her new duty as a training ship for midshipmen, based at Norfolk.
After four months of operations in Chesapeake Bay, the battleship
returned to New York to resume her role as a convoy escort. On 8
October, the ship sailed for Bangor, Ireland. She was in that
port throughout November, and got underway to return to New York
on 1 December. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ARKANSAS then
began a period of repairs on 12 December. Clearing New York for
Norfolk two days after Christmas of 1943, ARKANSAS closed the
year in that port.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleship
sailed on 19 January 1944 with a convoy bound for Ireland. After
seeing the convoy safely to its destination, the ship reversed
her course across the Atlantic and reached New York on 13
February. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ARKANSAS went to
Casco Bay on 28 March for gunnery exercises, before she proceeded
to Boston on 11 April for repairs.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 18 April,
ARKANSAS sailed once more for Bangor, Ireland. Upon her arrival,
the battleship began a training period to prepare for her new
role as a shore bombardment snip. On 3 June, ARKANSAS sailed for
the French coast to support the Allied invasion of Normandy. The
ship entered the Baie de la Seine on 6 June, and took up a
position 4,000 yards off &quot;Omaha&quot; beach. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At 0552,
ARKANSAS's guns opened fire. During the day, the venerable
battleship underwent shore battery fire and air attacks; over
ensuing days she continued her fire support. On the 13th,
ARKANSAS shifted to a position off Grandcamp les Bains.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 25 June 1944,
ARKANSAS dueled with German shore batteries off Cherbourg, the
enemy repeatedly straddling the battleship but never hitting her.
Her big guns helped support the Allied attack on that key port,
and led to the capture of it the following day. Retiring to
Weymouth, England, and arriving there at 2220, the battleship
shifted to Bangor, on 30 June.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ARKANSAS stood out
to sea on 4 July, bound for the Mediterranean. She passed through
the Strait of Gibraltar and anchored at Oran, Algeria, on 10
July. On the 18th, she got underway, and reached Taranto, Italy,
on 21 July. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleship
remained there until 6 August, then shifted to Palermo, Sicily,
on the 7th.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 14 August,
Operation &quot;Anvil&quot; the invasion of the southern French
coast between Toulon and Cannes, began. ARKANSAS provided fire
support for the initial landings on 15 August, and continued her
bombardment through 17 August. After stops at Palermo and Oran,
ARKANSAS set course for the United States. On 14 September, she
reached Boston, and received repairs and alterations through
early November. The yard period completed on 7 November, ARKANSAS
sailed to Casco Bay for three days of refresher training. On 10
November, ARKANSAS shaped a course south for the Panama Canal
Zone. After transiting the canal on 22 November, ARKANSAS headed
for San Pedro, Calif. On 29 November, the ship was again underway
for exercises held off San Diego. She returned on 10 December to
San Pedro.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After three more
weeks of preparations, ARKANSAS sailed for Pearl Harbor on 20
January 1945. One day after her arrival there, she sailed for
Ulithi, the major fleet staging area in the Carolines, and
continued thence to Tinian, where she arrived on 12 February. For
two days, the vessel held shore bombardment practice prior to her
participation in the assault on Iwo Jima.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At 0600 on 16
February, ARKANSAS opened fire on Japanese strong points on Iwo
Jima as she lay off the island's west coast. The old battlewagon
bombarded the island through the 19th, and remained in the fire
support area to provide cover during the evening hours. During
her time off the embattled island, ARKANSAS shelled numerous
Japanese positions, in support of the bitter struggle by the
marines to root out and destroy the stubborn enemy resistance.
She cleared the waters off Iwo Jima on 7 March to return to
Ulithi. After arriving at that atoll on the 10th, the battleship
rearmed, provisioned, and fueled in preparation for her next
operation, the invasion of Okinawa.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Getting underway
on 21 March, ARKANSAS began her preliminary shelling of Japanese
positions on Okinawa on 25 March, some days ahead of the assault
troops which began wading ashore on 1 April. The Japanese soon
began an aerial onslaught, and ARKANSAS fended off several
kamikazes. For 46 days, ARKANSAS delivered fire support for the
invasion of Okinawa. On 14 May, the ship arrived at Apra Harbor,
Guam, to await further assignment.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After a month at
Apra Harbor, part of which she spent in drydock, ARKANSAS got
underway on 12 June for Leyte Gulf. She anchored there on the
16th, and remained in Philippine waters until the war drew to a
close in August. On the 20th of that month, ARKANSAS left Leyte
to return to Okinawa, and reached Buckner Bay on 23 August. After
a month spent in port, ARKANSAS embarked approximately 800 troops
for transport to the United States as part of the &quot;Magic
Carpet&quot; to return American servicemen home as quickly as
possible. Sailing on 23 September, ARKANSAS paused briefly at
Pearl Harbor en route, and ultimately reached Seattle on 15
October. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">During the
remainder of the year, the battleship made three more trips to
Pearl Harbor to shuttle soldiers back to the United States. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">During the first
months of 1946, ARKANSAS lay at San Francisco. In late April the
ship got underway for Hawaii. She reached Pearl Harbor on 8 May,
and stood out of Pearl Harbor on 20 May, bound for Bikini Atoll,
earmarked for use as target for atomic bomb testing in Operation
&quot;Crossroads.&quot; On 25 July 1946, the venerable battleship
was sunk in Test &quot;Baker&quot; at Bikini. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Decommissioned on
29 July 1946, ARKANSAS was struck from the Naval Vessel Register
on 15 August 1946.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">ARKANSAS received
four battle stars for her World War II service. </font></p>
