<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The second
WISCONSIN (BB-64) was laid down on 25 January 1941 at the
Philadelphia Navy Yard; launched on 7 December 1943; sponsored by
Mrs. Walter S. Goodland; and commissioned on 16 April 1944, Capt.
Earl E. Stone in command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After her trials
and initial training in the Chesapeake Bay, WISCONSIN departed
Norfolk, Va., on 7 July 1944, bound for the British West Indies.
Following her shakedown, conducted out of Trinidad, the third of
the IOWA-class battleships to join the Fleet returned to her
builder's yard for postshakedown repairs and alterations.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 24 September
1944, WISCONSIN sailed for the west coast, transited the Panama
Canal, and reported for duty with the Pacific Fleet on 2 October.
The battleship later moved to Hawaiian waters for training
exercises and then headed for the Western Carolines. Upon
reaching Ulithi on 9 December, she joined Admiral William F.
Halsey's 3d Fleet.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The powerful new
warship had arrived at a time when the reconquest of the
Philippines was well underway. As a part of that movement, the
planners had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of
Mindoro, south of Luzon. From that point, American forces could
threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the South China Sea.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The day before the
amphibians assaulted Mindoro, the 3d Fleet's Fast Carrier Task
Force (TF) 38-supported in art by WISCONSINrendered Japanese
facilities at Manila largely useless. Between 14 and 16 December,
TF 38's naval aviators secured complete tactical surprise and
quickly won complete mastery of the air and sank or destroyed 27
Japanese vessels; damaged 60 more; destroyed 269 planes; and
bombed miscellaneous ground installations.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The next day the
weather, however, soon turned sour for Halsey's sailors. A
furious typhoon struck his fleet, catching many ships refueling
and with little ballast in their nearly dry bunkers. Three
destroyers- HULL (DD-350), MONAGHAN (DD-354), and SPENCE
(DD-512)-capsized and sank. WISCONSIN proved her seaworthiness as
she escaped the storm unscathed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As heavily
contested as they were, the Mindoro operations proved only the
introduction to another series of calculated blows aimed at the
occupying Japanese in the Philippines. For WISCONSIN, her next
operation was the occupation of Luzon. Bypassing the southern
beaches, American amphibians went ashore at Lingayen Gulf-the
scene of the Japanese landings nearly three years before.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WISCONSIN-armed
with heavy antiaircraft batteries -performed escort duty for TF
38's fast carriers during air strikes against Formosa, Luzon, and
the Nansei Shoto, to neutralize Japanese forces there and to
cover the unfolding Lingayen Gulf operations. Those strikes,
lasting from 3 to 22 January 1945, included a thrust into the
South China Sea, in the hope that major units of the Japanese
Navy could be drawn into battle.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Air strikes
between Saigon and Camranh Bay, Indochina, on 12 January resulted
in severe losses for the enemy. TF 38's warplanes sank 41 ships
and damaged heavily damaged docks, storage areas, and aircraft
facilities. At least 112 enemy planes would never again see
operational service. Formosa, already struck on 3 and 4 January,
again fell victim to the marauding American airmen, being smashed
again on 9, 15, and 21 January. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Soon, Hong Kong,
Canton, and Hainan Island felt the brunt of TF 38's power.
Besides damaging and sinking Japanese shipping, American planes
from the task force set the Canton oil refineries afire and
blasted the Hong Kong Naval Station. They also raided Okinawa on
22 January, considerably lessening enemy air activities that
could threaten the Luzon landings.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Subsequently
assigned to the 5th Fleet-when Admiral Spruance relieved Admiral
Halsey as Commander of the Fleet-WISCONSIN moved northward with
the redesignated TF 58 as the carriers headed for the Tokyo area.
On 16 February 1945, the task force approached the Japanese coast
under cover of adverse weather conditions and achieved complete
tactical surprise. As a result, they shot down 322 enemy planes
and destroyed 177 more on the ground, Japanese shipping-both
naval and merchant-suffered drastically, too, as did hangars and
aircraft installations. Moreover, all this damage to the enemy
had cost the American Navy only 49 planes.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The task force
moved to Iwo Jima on 17 February to provide direct support for
the landings slated to take place on that island on the 19th. It
revisited Tokyo on the 25th and, the next day, hit the island of
Hachino off the coast of Honshu. During these raids, besides
causing heavy damage or ground facilities, the American planes
sent five small vessels to the bottom and destroyed 158 planes.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 1 March,
reconnaissance planes flew over the island of Okinawa, taking
last minute intelligence photographs to be used in planning the
assault on that island. The next day, cruisers from TF 58 shelled
Okino Daito Shima in training for the forthcoming operation. The
force then retired to Ulithi for replenishment. WISCONSIN's task
force stood out of Ulithi on 14 March, bound for Japan. The
mission of that group was to eliminate airborne resistance from
the Japanese homeland to American forces off Okinawa. Enemy fleet
units at Kure and Kobe, on southern Honshu, reeled under the
impact of the explosive blows delivered by TF 58's airmen. On 18
and 19 March, from a point 100 miles southwest of Kyushu, TF 58
hit enemy airfields on that island. However, the Japanese drew
blood during that action when kamikazes crashed into FRANKLIN
(CV-17) on the 19th and seriously damaged that fleet carrier.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">That afternoon,
the task force retired from Kyushu, screening the blazing and
battered flattop. In doing so, the screen downed 48 attackers. At
the conclusion of the operation, the force felt that it had
achieved its mission of prohibiting any large-scale resistance
from the air to the slated landings on Okinawa.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On the 24th,
WISCONSIN trained her 16-inch rifles on targets ashore on
Okinawa. Together with the other battlewagons of the task force,
she pounded Japanese positions and installations in preparation
for the landings. Although fierce, Japanese resistance was doomed
to fail by dwindling numbers of aircraft and trained pilots to
man them. In addition, the Japanese fleet, steadily hammered by
air attacks from 5th Fleet aircraft, found itself confronted by a
growing, powerful, and determined enemy. On 17 April, the
undaunted enemy battleship YAMATO, with her 18.1-inch guns,
sortied to attack the American invasion fleet off Okinawa. Met
head-on by a swarm of carrier planes, YAMATO, the light cruiser
YAHAGI, and four destroyers went to the bottom, the victims of
massed air power. Never again would the Japanese fleet present a
major challenge to the American fleet in the war in the Pacific.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">While TF 58's
planes were off dispatching YAMATO and her consorts to the bottom
of the South China Sea, enemy aircraft struck back at American
surface units. Combat air patrols (CAP) knocked down 15 enemy
planes, and ships' gunfire accounted for another three, but not
before one kamikaze penetrated the CAP and screen to crash on the
flight deck of the fleet carrier HANCOCK (CV-19). On 11 April,
the &quot;Divine Wind&quot; renewed its efforts; and only drastic
maneuvers and heavy barrages of gunfire saved the task force.
None of the fanatical pilots achieved any direct hits, although
near-misses, close aboard, managed to cause some minor damage.
Combat air patrols bagged 17 planes, and ships' gunfire accounted
for an even dozen. The next day, 151 enemy aircraft committed
hara-kiri into TF 58, but WISCONSIN, bristling with 5-inch,
40-millimeter and 20 millimeter guns, together with other units
of the screens for the vital carriers, kept the enemy at bay or
destroyed him before he could reach his targets.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Over the days that
ensued, American task force planes hit Japanese facilities and
installations in the enemy's homeland. Kamikazes, redoubling
their efforts, managed to crash into three carriers on successive
days -INTREPID (CV-11), BUNKER HILL (CV17), and ENTERPRISE
(CV-6).</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">By 4 June, a
typhoon was swirling through the Fleet. WISCONSIN rode out the
storm unscathed, but three cruisers, two carriers, and a
destroyer suffered serious damage. Offensive operations were
resumed on 8 June with a final aerial assault on Kyushu. Japanese
aerial response was pitifully small; 29 planes were located and
destroyed. On that day, one of WISCONSIN's floatplanes landed and
rescued a downed pilot from the carrier SHANGRI-LA (CV-38).</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WISCONSIN
ultimately put into Leyte Gulf and dropped anchor there on 18
June for repairs and replenishment. Three weeks later, on 1 July,
the battleship and her consorts sailed once more for Japanese
home waters for carrier air strikes on the enemy's heartland.
Nine days later, carrier planes from TF 38 destroyed 72 enemy
aircraft on the ground and smashed industrial sites in the Tokyo
area. So little was the threat from the dwindling Japanese air
arm that the Americans made no attempt whatever to conceal the
location of their armada which was operating off her shores with
impunity.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On the 16th,
WISCONSIN again unlimbered her main battery, hurling 16-inch
shells shoreward at the steel mills and oil refineries at
Muroran, Hokkaido. Two days later, she wrecked industrial
facilities in the Hitachi Miro area, on the coast of Honshu,
northeast of Tokyo itself. During that bombardment, British
battleships of the Eastern Fleet contributed their heavy
shellfire. By that point in the war, Allied warships were able to
shell the Japanese homeland almost at will.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Task Force 38's
planes subsequently blasted the Japanese naval base at Yokosuka,
and put one of the two remaining Japanese battleships- the former
fleet flagship NAGATO out of action. On 24 and 25 July, American
carrier planes visited the Inland Sea region, blasting enemy
sites on Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku. Kure then again came under
attack. Six major fleet units were located there and badly
damaged, marking the virtual end of Japanese sea power.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Over the weeks
that ensued, TF 38 continue its raids on Japanese industrial
facilities, airfields, and merchant and naval shipping. Admiral
Halsey's airmen visited destruction upon the Japanese capital for
the last time on 13 August 1946. Two days later, the Japanese
capitulated. World War II was over at last.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WISCONSIN, as port
of the occupying force, arrived at Tokyo Bay on 6 September,
three days after the formal surrender occurred on board the
battleship MISSOURI (BB-63). During WISCONSIN's brief career in
World War II, she had steamed 105,831 miles since commissioning;
had shot down three enemy planes; had claimed assists on four
occasions; and had fueled her screening destroyers on some 250
occasions.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Shifting
subsequently to Okinawa, the battleship embarked homeward-bound
GI's on 22 September, as part of the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot;
operation staged to bring soldiers, sailors, and marines home
from the far-flung battlefronts of the Pacific. Departing Okinawa
on 23 September, WISCONSIN reached Pearl Harbor on 4 October,
remaining there for five days before she pushed on for the west
coast on the last leg of her state-side bound voyage. She reached
San Francisco on 15 October.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Heading for the
east coast of the United States soon after the start of the new
year, 1946, WISCONSIN transited the Panama Canal between 11 and
13 January and reached Hampton Roads, Va., on the 18th. Following
a cruise south to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the battleship entered
the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for overhaul. After repairs and
alterations that consumed the summer months, WISCONSIN sailed for
South American waters.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Over the weeks
that ensued, the battleship visited Valparaiso, Chile, from 1 to
6 November; Callao, Peru, from 9 to 13 November; Balboa, Canal
Zone, from 16 to 20 November; and La Guajira, Venezuela, from 22
to 26 November, before returning to Norfolk: on 2 December 1946.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WISCONSIN spent
nearly all of 1947 as a training ship, taking naval reservists on
two-week cruises through-out the year. Those voyages commenced at
Bayonne, N.J,, and saw visits conducted at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
and the Panama Canal Zone. While underway at sea, the ship would
perform various drills and exercises before the cruise would end
where it had started, at Bayonne. During June and July of 1947,
WISCONSIN took Naval Academy midshipmen on cruises to northern
European waters.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In January 1948,
WISCONSIN joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Norfolk, for
inactivation. Placed out of commission, in reserve on 1 July 1948
WISCONSIN was assigned to the Norfolk group of the Atlantic
Reserve Fleet.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Her sojourn in
&quot;mothballs,&quot; however, was comparatively brief because
of the North Korean invasion of South Korea in late June 1950.
WISCONSIN was recommissioned, on 3 March 1951, Capt. Thomas
Burrowes in command. After shakedown training, the revitalized
battleship conducted two midshipmen training cruises, taking the
officers-to-be to Edinburgh, Scotland; Lisbon, Portugal; Halifax,
Nova Scotia; New York City; and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, before she
returned to Norfolk.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WISCONSIN departed
Norfolk on 25 October 1951, bound for the Pacific. She transited
the Panama Canal on the 29th and reached. Yokosuka, Japan, on 21
November. There, she relieved NEW JERSEY (BB-62) as flagship for
Vice Admiral H. M. Martin, Commander, 7th Fleet.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On the 26th, with
Vice Admiral Martin and Rear Admiral F. P. Denebrink, Commander,
Service Force, Pacific, embarked, WISCONSIN departed Yokosuka for
Korean waters to support the fast carrier operations of TF 77.
She left the company of the carrier force on 2 December and,
screened by the destroyer WILTSIE (DD-716), provided gunfire
support for the Republic of Korea (ROK) Corps in the
Kasong-Kosong area. After disembarking Admiral Denebrink on 3
December at Kangnung, the battleship resumed station on the
Korean &quot;bombline,&quot; providing gunfire support for the
American 1st Marine Division. WISCONSIN's shellings accounted for
a tank, two gun emplacements, and a building. She continued her
gunfire support task for the 1st Marine Division and 1st ROK
Corps through 6 December, accounting for enemy bunkers, artillery
positions, and troop concentrations. On one occasion during that
time, the battleship received a request for call-fire support and
provided three starshells for the 1st ROK Corps, illuminating a
communist attack that was consequently repulsed with considerable
enemy casualties.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After being
relieved on the gunline by the heavy cruiser ST. PAUL (CA-78) on
6 December, WISCONSIN retired only briefly from gunfire support
duties. She resumed them, however, in the Kasong-Kosong area on
11 December screened by the destroyer TWINING (DD-540). The
following day, 12 December, saw the embarkation in WISCONSIN of
Rear Admiral H. R. Thurber, Commander, Battleship Division 2. The
admiral came on board via helicopter, incident to his inspection
trip in the Far East.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleship
continued naval gunfire support duties on the
&quot;bombline,&quot; shelling enemy bunkers, command posts,
artillery positions, and trench systems through 14 December. She
departed the &quot;bombline&quot; on that day to render special
gunfire support duties in the Kojo area blasting coastal targets
in support of United Nations (UN) troops ashore. That same day,
she returned to the Kasong-Kosong area. On the 15th, she
disembarked Admiral Thurber by helicopter. The next day,
WISCONSIN departed Korean waters, heading for Sasebo to rearm.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Returning to the
combat zone on the 17th, WISCONSIN embarked United States Senator
Homer Ferguson of Michigan on the 18th. That day, the battleship
supported the 11th ROK invasion with night illumination fire that
enabled the ROK troops to repulse a communist assault with heavy
enemy casualties. Departing the &quot;bombline&quot; on the 19th,
the battleship later that day transferred her distinguished
passenger, Senator Ferguson, by helicopter to the carrier VALLEY
FORGE (CV-45).</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WISCONSIN next
participated in a coordinated air-surface bombardment of Wonsan
to neutralize pre-selected targets. She shifted her bombardment
station. to the western end of Wonsan harbor, hitting boats and
small craft in the inner swept channel during the afternoon. Such
activities helped to forestall any communist attempts to assault
the friendly-held islands in the Wonsan area. WISCONSIN then made
an anti-boat sweep to the north, utilizing her 5-inch batteries
on suspected boat concentrations. She then provided gunfire
support to UN troops operating at the &quot;bombline&quot; until
three days before Christmas 1951. She then rejoined the carrier
task force.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 28 December,
Francis Cardinal Spellman-on a Korean tour over the Christmas
holidays-visited the ship, coming on board by helicopter to
celebrate Mass for the Catholic members of the crew. The
distinguished prelate departed the ship by helicopter off Pohang.
Three days later, on the last day of the year, WISCONSIN put into
Yokosuka.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WISCONSIN departed
that Japanese port on 8 January 1952 and headed for Korean waters
once more. She reached Pusan the following day and entertained
the President of South Korea, Syngman Rhee, and his wife, on the
10th. President and Mrs. Rhee received full military honors as
they came on board, and he reciprocated by awarding Vice Admiral
Martin the ROK Order of the Military Merit.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WISCONSIN returned
to the &quot;bombline&quot; on 11 January and, over the ensuing
days, delivered heavy gunfire support for the 1st Marine Division
and the 1st ROK Corps. As before, her primary targets were
command posts, shelters, bunkers, troop concentrations and mortar
positions. As before, she stood ready to deliver; callfire
support as needed. One such occasion occurred; on 14 January when
she shelled enemy troops in the open at the request of the ROK
1st Corps.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Rearming at Sasebo
and once more joining TF 77 off the coast of Korea soon
thereafter, WISCONSIN resumed support at the &quot;bombline&quot;
on 23 January. Three days later, she shifted once more to the
Kojo region, to participate in a coordinated air and gun strike.
That same day, the battleship-returned to the
&quot;bombline&quot; and shelled the command post and
communications center for the 15th North Korean Division during
call-fire missions for the 1st Marine Division.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Returning to
Wonsan at the end of January, WISCONSIN bombarded enemy guns at
Hodo Pando before she was rearmed at Sasebo. The battleship
rejoined TF 77 on 2 February and the next day, blasted railway
buildings and marshaling yards at Hodo Pando and Kojo before
rejoining TF 77. After replenishment at Yokosuka a few days
later, she returned to the Kosong area and resumed gunfire
support. During that time, she destroyed railway bridges and a
small shipyard besides conducting callfire missions on enemy
command posts, bunkers, and personnel shelters, making numerous
cuts on enemy trench lines in the process.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 26 February,
WISCONSIN arrived at Pusan where Vice Admiral Shon, the ROK Chief
of Naval Operations; United States Ambassador J. J. Muccio; and
Rear Admiral Scott-Montcrief, Royal Navy, Commander, Task Group
95.12, visited the battleship. Departing that South Korean port
the following day, WISCONSIN reached Yokosuka on 2 March. A week
later, she shifted to Sasebo to prepare to return to Korean
waters.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WISCONSIN arrived
off Songjin, Korea, on 15 March 1952 and concentrated her gunfire
on enemy railway transport. Early that morning, she destroyed a
communist troop train trapped outside of a destroyed tunnel. That
afternoon, she received the first direct hit in, her history,
when one of four shells from a communist 155-millimeter gun
battery struck the shield of a starboard 40-millimeter mount.
Although little material damage resulted, three men were injured.
Almost as if the victim of a personal affront, WISCONSIN
subsequently blasted that battery to oblivion with a 16-inch
salvo before continuing her mission. After lending a hand to
support once more the 1st Marine Division with her heavy rifles,
the battleship returned to Japan on 19 March.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Relieved as
flagship of the 7th Fleet on 1 April by sistership IOWA (BB-61),
WISCONSIN departed Yokosuka, bound for the United States. En
route home, she touched briefly at Guam, where she took part in
the successful test of the Navy's largest floating dry-dock on 4
and 5 April, marking the first time that an IOWAclass battleship
had ever utilized that type of facility. She continued her
homeward-bound voyage, via Pearl Harbor, and arrived at Long
Beach, Calif., on l9 April, She then sailed for the east coast;
her destination: Norfolk.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Early in June
1962, WISCONSIN resumed her role as a training ship, taking
midshipmen to Greenock, Scotland; Brest, France; and Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, before returning to Norfolk. She departed Hampton
Roads on 25 August and participated in a North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) exercise, Operation &quot;Mainbrace&quot;
which commenced at Greenock and extended as far north as Oslo,
Norway. After her return to Norfolk, WISCONSIN underwent an
overhaul in the naval shipyard there. She then engaged in local
training evolutions until 11 February 1953, when she sailed for
Cuban waters for refresher training. She visited Newport, R.I.,
and New York City before returning to Norfolk late in April.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Following another
midshipman's training cruise to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;
Port-of-Spain, Trinidad; and Guantanamo Bay, WISCONSIN put into
the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 4 August for a brief overhaul. A
little over a month later, upon conclusion of that period of
repairs and alterations, the battleship departed Norfolk on 9
September, bound for the Far East.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Sailing via the
Panama Canal to Japan, WISCONSIN relieved NEW JERSEY (BB-62) as
7th Fleet flagship on 12 October. During the months that
followed, WISCONSIN visited the Japanese ports of Kobe, Sasebo,
Yokosuka, Otaru, and Nagasaki. She spent Christmas at Hong Kong
and was ultimately relieved of flagship duties on 1 April 1954
and returned to the United States soon thereafter, teaching
Norfolk, via Long Beach and the Panama Canal, on 4 May 1954.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Entering the
Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 11 June, WISCONSIN underwent a brief
overhaul and commenced a midshipman training cruise on 12 July.
After revisiting Greenock, Brest, and Guantanamo Bay, the ship
returned to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for repairs. Shortly
thereafter, WISCONSIN participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises as
flagship for Commander, 2d Fleet. Departing Norfolk in January
1955, WISCONSIN took part in operation &quot;Springboard,&quot;
during which time she visited Port-auPrince, Haiti. Then, upon
returning to Norfolk, the battleship conducted another
midshipman's cruise that summer, visiting Edinburgh; Copenhagen,
Denmark; and Guantanamo Bay before returning to the United
States.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Upon completion of
a major overhaul at the New York Naval Shipyard, WISCONSIN headed
south for refresher training in the Caribbean, later taking part
in another &quot;Springboard&quot; exercise. During that cruise,
she again visited Port-au-Prince and added Tampico, Mexico, and
Cartagena, Colombia, to her list of ports of call. She returned
to Norfolk on the last day of March 1955 for local operations.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Throughout April
and into May, WISCONSIN operated locally off the Virginia capes.
On 6 May, the battleship collided with the destroyer EATON
(DDE-510) in a heavy fog; WISCONSIN put into Norfolk with
extensive damage to her bow and, one week later, entered drydock
at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. A novel expedient speeded her
repairs and enabled the ship to carry out her scheduled
midshipman training cruise that summer. A 120-ton, 68-foot long
section of the bow of the uncompleted battleship KENTUCKY was
transported by barge, in one section, from New Newport News
Shipbuilding and Drydock Corp., Newport News, Va., across Hampton
Roads to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Working round-the clock,
WISCONSIN's ship's force and shipyard personnel completed the
operation which grafted the new bow on the old battleship in a
mere 16 days. On 28 June 1956, the ship was ready for sea.</font></p>

returning to Norfolk on the last day of August. That autumn,
WISCONSIN participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises off the coast
of the Carolinas, returning to port on 8 November 1956. Entering
the Norfolk Naval Shipyard a week later, the battleship underwent
major repairs that were not finished until 2 January 1957.</font></p>

Breaking the two-starred flag of Rear Admiral Henry Crommelin,
Commander, Battleship Division 2, WISCONSIN served as Admiral
Crommelin's flagship during the ensuing shore bombardment
practices and other exercises held off the isle of Culebra,
Puerto Rico, from 2 to 4 February 1957. Sailing for Norfolk upon
completion of the training period, the battleship arrived on 7
February.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The warship
conducted a brief period of local operations off Norfolk before
she sailed, on 27 March, for the Mediterranean. Reaching
Gibraltar on 6 April, she pushed on that day to rendezvous with
TF 60 in the Aegean Sea. She then proceeded with that force to
Xeros Bay, Turkey, arriving there on 11 April for NATO Exercise
&quot;Red Pivot.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Departing Xeros

training cruise through the Panama Canal to South American
waters. She transited the canal on 26 June; crossed the equator
on the following day; and reached Valparaiso, Chile, on 3 July.
Eight days later, the battleship headed back to the Panama Canal
and the Atlantic.</font></p>
