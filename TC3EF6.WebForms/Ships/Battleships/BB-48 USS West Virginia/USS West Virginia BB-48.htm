<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The second WEST
VIRGINIA (Battleship No. 48) was laid down on 12 April 1920 by
the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. of Newport News,
Va.; reclassified to BB-48 on 17 July 1920; launched on 17
November 1921; sponsored by Miss Alice Wright Mann, daughter of
Isaac T. Mann, a prominent West Virginian; and commissioned on 1
December 1923, Capt. Thomas J. Senn in command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The most recent of
the &quot;super-dreadnoughts,&quot; WEST VIRGINIA embodied the
latest knowledge of naval architecture; the watertight
compartmentation of her hull and her armor protection marked an
advance over the design of battleships built or on the drawing
boards before the Battle of Jutland.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In the months that
followed, WEST VIRGINIA ran her trials and shakedown and
underwent post-commissioning alterations. After a brief period of
work at the New York Navy yard, the ship made the passage to
Hampton Roads, although experiencing trouble with her steering
gear while en route. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Overhauling the
troublesome gear thoroughly while in Hampton Roads, WEST VIRGINIA
put to sea on the morning of 16 June 1924. At 1010, while the
battleship was steaming in the center of Lynnhaven Channel, the
quartermaster at the wheel reported that the rudder indicator
would not answer. The ringing of the emergency bell to the
steering motor room produced no response; Capt. Senn quickly
ordered all engines stopped, but the engine room telegraph would
not answer-it was later discovered that there was no power to the
engine room telegraph or the steering telegraph.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The captain then
resorted to sending orders down to main control via the voice
tube from the bridge. He ordered full speed head on the port
engine; all stop on the starboard. Efforts continued apace over
the ensuing moments to steer the ship with her engines and keep
her in the channel and, when this failed, to check headway from
the edge of the channel. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately, all
efforts failed; and, as the ship lost headway due to an engine
casualty, WEST VIRGINIA grounded on the soft mud bottom.
Fortunately, as Comdr. (later Admiral) Harold R: Stark, the
executive officer, reported: &quot;. . . not the slightest damage
to the hull had been sustained.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The court of
inquiry, investigating the grounding, found that inaccurate and
misleading navigational data had been supplied the ship. The
legends on the charts provided were found to have indicated
uniformly greater channel width than actually existed. The
findings of the court thus exonerated Capt. Senn and the
navigator from any blame.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After repairs had
been effected, WEST VIRGINIA became flagship for the Commander,
Battleship Divisions, Battle Fleet, on 30 October 1924, thus
beginning her service as an integral part of the &quot;backbone
of the fleet&quot;-as the battleships were regarded. She soon
proved her worth under a succession of commanding officers-most
of whom later attained flag rank. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In 1926, for
example, under Capt. A. J. Hepburn, the comparative newcomer to
battleship ranks scored first in competitive short range target
practices. During Hepburn's tour, WEST VIRGINIA garnered two
trophies for attaining the highest merit in the category.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The ship later won
the American Defense Cup presented by the American Defense
Society to the battleship obtaining the highest merit with all
guns in short-range firing-and the Spokane Cup, presented by that
city's Chamber of Commerce in recognition of the battleship's
scoring the highest merit with all guns at short range. In 1925,
WEST VIRGINIA won the Battle Efficiency Pennant for
battleships-the first time that the ship had won the coveted
&quot;Meatball.&quot; She won it again in 1927, 1992, and 1933.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">During this
period; WEST VIRGINIA underwent a cycle of training, maintenance,
and readiness exercises, taking part in engineering and gunnery
competitions and the annual large-scale exercises, or &quot;Fleet
Problems.&quot; In the latter the Fleet would be divided up into
opposing sides, and a strategic or tactical situation would be
played out, with the lessons learned becoming part and parcel of
the development of doctrine that would later be tested in the
crucible of combat.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">During 1926, the
battleship took part in the joint Army-Navy maneuvers to test the
defenses of the Hawaiian Islands and then cruised with the Fleet
to Australia and New Zealand. In fleet exercises subsequent to
the 1926 cruise, WEST VIRGINIA ranged from Hawaii to the
Caribbean and the Atlantic, and from Alaskan waters to Panama.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In order to keep
pace with technological developments in ordnance, gunnery, and
fire control-as well as engineering and aviation-the ship
underwent modifications designed to increase the ship's capacity
to perform her designed function. Some of the alterations
effected included the replacement of her initial 3-inch
antiaircraft battery with 5-inch/25-caliber dual-purpose guns;
the addition of platforms for .50-caliber machine guns at the
foremast and maintop; and the addition of catapults on her
quarterdeck, aft, and on her number III, or &quot;high&quot;
turret.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In the closing
years of the decade of the 1930's, however, it was becoming
evident to many that it was only a matter of time before the
United States became involved in yet another war on a grand
scale. The United States Fleet thus came to be considered a grand
deterrent to the country's most probable enemy Japan. This
reasoning produced the hurried despatch of the Fleet to Pacific
waters in the spring of 1939 and the retention of the Fleet in
Hawaiian waters in 1940, following the conclusion of Fleet
Problem XXI in April.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As the year 1941
progressed, WEST VIRGINIA carried out a schedule of intensive
training, basing on Pearl Harbor and operating in various task
forces and groups in the Hawaiian operating area. This routine
continued even through the unusually tense period that began in
late November and extended into the next month. Such at-sea
periods were usually followed by in-port upkeep, with the
battleships mooring to masonry &quot;quays&quot; along the
southeast shores of Ford Island in the center of Pearl Harbor.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On Sunday, 7,
December 1941, WEST VIRGINIA lay moored outboard of TENNESSEE
(BB-43) at berth F-6 with 40 feet of water beneath her keel.
Shortly before 0800, Japanese planes, flying from a six-carrier
task force, commenced their well-planned attack on the Fleet at
Pearl Harbor. WEST VIRGINIA took five 18-inch aircraft torpedoes
in her port side and two bomb hits those bombs being 15-inch
armor-piercing shells fitted with fins. The first bomb penetrated
the superstructure deck, wrecking the port casemates and causing
that deck to collapse to the level of the galley deck below. Four
casemates and the galley caught fire immediately, with the
subsequent detonation of the ready-service projectiles stowed in
the casemates.The second bomb hit further aft, wrecking one
Vought OS2U Kingfisher floatplane atop the &quot;high&quot;
catapult on Turret III and pitching the second one on her top on
the main deck below. The projectile penetrated the 4-inch turret
roof, wrecking one gun in the turret itself. Although the bomb
proved a dud, burning gasoline from the damaged aircraft caused
some damage.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The torpedoes,
though, ripped into the ship's port side; only prompt action by
Lt. Claude V. Ricketts, the assistant fire control officer who
had some knowledge of damage control techniques, saved the ship
from the fate that befell Oklahoma (BB-37) moored ahead. She,
too, took torpedo hits that flooded the ship and caused her to
capsize.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Instances of
heroic conduct on board the heavily damaged battleship
proliferated in the heat of battle. The ship's commanding
officer, Capt. Mervyn S. Bennion, arrived on his bridge early in
the battle, only to be struck down by a bomb fragment hurled in
his direction when a 15-inch &quot;bomb&quot; hit the center gun
in TENNESSEE's Turret II, spraying that ship's superstructure and
WEST VIRGINIA's with fragments. Bennion, hit in the abdomen,
crumpled to the deck, mortally wounded, but clung tenaciously to
life until just before the ship was abandoned, involved in the
conduct of the ship's defense up to the last moment of his life.
For his conspicuous devotion to duty, extraordinary courage, and
complete disregard of his own life, Capt. Bennion was awarded a
Medal of Honor, posthumously.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WEST VIRGINIA was
abandoned, settling to the harbor bottom on an even keel, her
fires fought from on board by a party that volunteered to return
to the ship after the first abandonment. By the afternoon of the
following day, 8 December, the flames had been extinguished. The
garbage lighter, YG-17, played an important role in assisting
those efforts during the Pearl Harbor attack, remaining in
position alongside despite the danger posed by exploding
ammunition on board the battleship.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Later examination
revealed that WEST VIRGINIA had taken not five, but six, torpedo
hits. With a patch over the damaged area of her hull, the
battleship was pumped out and ultimately refloated on 17 May
1942. Docked in Drydock Number One on 9 June, WEST VIRGINIA again
came under scrutiny, and it was discovered that there had been
not six, but seven torpedo hits.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">During the ensuing
repairs, workers located 70 bodies of WEST VIRGINIA sailors who
had been trapped below when the ship sank. In one compartment, a
calendar was found, the last scratch-off date being 23 December.
The task confronting the nucleus crew and shipyard workers was a
monumental one, so great was the damage on the battleship's port
side. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Ultimately,
however, WEST VIRGINIA departed Pearl Harbor for the west coast
and a complete rebuilding at the Puget Sound Navy Yard at
Bremerton, Wash.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Emerging from the
extensive modernization, the battleship that had risen,
Phoenix-like, from the destruction at Pearl Harbor looked totally
different from the way she had appeared prior to 7 December 1941.
Gone were the &quot;cage&quot; masts that supported the
three-tier fire-control tops, as well as the two funnels, the
open-mount 5-inch/25's and the casemates with the single-purpose
5-inch/51's. A streamlined superstructure now gave the ship a
totally new silhouette; dual-purpose 5-inch/38-caliber guns, in
gunhouses, gave the ship a potent antiaircraft battery. In
addition, 40-millimeter Bofors and 20-millimeter Oerlikon
batteries studded the decks, giving the ship a heavy
&quot;punch&quot; for dealing with close-in enemy planes.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WEST VIRGINIA
remained at Puget Sound until early July 1944. Loading ammunition
on the 2d, the battleship got underway soon thereafter to conduct
her sea trials out of Port Townsend, Wash. She ran a full power
trial on the 6th, continuing her working-up until the 12th.
Subsequently returning to Puget Sound for lastminute repairs, the
battleship headed for San Pedro and her post-modernization
shakedown.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Finally ready to
rejoin the Fleet from which she had been away for two years, WEST
VIRGINIA sailed for the Hawaiian Islands on 14 September.
Escorted by two destroyers, she made landfall on Oahu on the 23d.
</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Ultimately pushing
on for Manus, in the Admiralties, in company with the fleet
carrier HANCOCK (CV-19), WEST VIRGINIA, as a unit of Battleship
Division (BatDiv) 4, reached Seeadler Harbor on 5 October. The
next day, she again became a flagship when Rear Admiral Ruddock
shifted his flag from MARYLAND (BB-46) to the &quot;Wee Vee&quot;
as Commander, BatDiv 4.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Underway on I2.
October to participate in the invasion of the Philippine Islands,
WEST VIRGINIA sailed as part of Task Group (TG) 77.2, under the
overall command of Rear admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf. On 18
October, the battle line passed into Leyte Gulf, WEST VIRGINIA
steaming astern of CALIFORNIA (BB-44).</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At 1645,
CALIFORNIA cut loose a mine with her paravanes; WEST VIRGINIA
successfully dodged the horned menace, it being destroyed a few
moments later by gunfire from one of the destroyers in the
screen. On 19 October, WEST VIRGINIA steamed into her assigned
station in San Pedro Bay at 0700 to stand by off shore and
provide shore bombardment against targets in the Tacloban area of
Leyte. Retiring to sea that evening, the battleship and her
consorts returned the next morning to lay down heavy gunfire on
Japanese installations in the vicinity of the town of Tacloban.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On the 19th, WEST
VIRGINIA's gunners sent 278 16-inch and 1,586 5-inch shells
against Japanese installations, silencing enemy artillery and
supporting the UDT (underwater demolition teams) preparing the
beaches for the assault that came on the 20th. On the latter day,
enemy planes made many appearances over the landing area. WEST
VIRGINIA took those within range under fire but did not down any.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On the 21st, as
she was proceeding to her fire support area to render further
gunfire support for the troops still pouring ashore, WEST
VIRGINIA touched bottom, slightly damaging three of her four
screws. The vibrations caused by the damaged blades limited
sustained speeds to 16 knots - 18 in emergencies.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">For the next two
days, WEST VIRGINIA, with her augmented antiaircraft batteries,
remained off the beachhead during the daylight hours, retiring to
seaward at night, providing antiaircraft covering fire for the
unfolding invasion operations. Meanwhile, the Japanese, seeing
that American operations against Leyte were on a large scale,
decided to strike back. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Accordingly, the
enemy, willing to accept the heavy risks involved, set out in
four widely separated forces to destroy the American invasion
fleet.Four carriers and two &quot;hermaphrodite&quot;
battleship-carriers (ISE and HYUGA) sailed toward the Philippine
Sea from Japanese home waters; a small surface force under
Admiral Shima headed for the Sulu Sea; two striking forces
consisting of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers sortied from
Lingga Roads, Sumatra, before separating north of Borneo. The
larger of those two groups, commanded by Admiral Kurita, passed
north of the island of Palawan to transit the Sibuyan Sea.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">American
submarines DARTER (SS-247) and DACE (SS-227) drew first blood in
what would become known as the Battle for Leyte Gulf on 29
October when they sank, respectively, two of Kurita's cruisers,
MAYA and ATAGO. Undeterred, Kurita continued the transit, his
force built around the giant battleship MUSASHI.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The smaller of the
two forces, under Admiral Nishimura, turned south of Palawan and
transited the Sulu Sea to pass between the islands of Mindanao
and Leyte. Shima's forces obediently followed Nishimura's,
heading for Leyte Gulf as the southern jaw of a pincer designed
to hit the assemblage of amphibious ships and transports
unloading off the Leyte beachhead.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Detailed to deal
with the force heading in his direction, Admiral Oldendorf
accordingly deployed his sizable force-six battleships, eight
cruisers, and 28 destroyers-across the northern end of Surigao
Strait. The American men-of-war steamed along their assigned
courses, their bows cleaving through the smooth sea.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At 2236 on 24
October 1944, the American PT boats deployed in the strait and
its approaches made radar contact with Nishimura's force,
conducting a harassing attack that annoyed, but did not stop, the
oncoming enemy. Well into the strait by 0300 on the 25th,
Nishimura took up battle formation when five American destroyers
launched a well-planned torpedo attack. Caught in the spread of
torpedoes, the battleship FUSO took hits and dropped out of the
formation; other spreads of &quot;fish&quot; dispatched a pair of
Japanese destroyers and crippled a third.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">FUSO's sistership
YAMASHIRO, meanwhile, had taken one hit and was slowed down, only
to be hit again within 15 minutes' time. FUSO herself, apparently
ravaged by fires ignited by the torpedo hits, blew up with a
tremendous explosion at 0338.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WEST VIRGINIA
meanwhile, was maintaining her position ahead of MARYLAND,
MISSISSIPPI (BB-41), TENNESSEE, CALIFORNIA, and PENNSYLVANIA
(BB-38)-four of these ships, like WEST VIRGINIA, veterans of
Pearl Harbor. From 0021 on the 25th, the battleship had picked up
reports on the PT boat and destroyer attacks; finally at 0316,
WEST VIRGINIA's radar picked up Nishimura's force at a range of
42,000 yards. She tracked them as they approached in the pitch
black night.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">At 0352, WEST
VIRGINIA unleashed her 16-inch main battery; she fired 16 salvoes
in the direction of Nishimura's ships as Oldendorf crossed the
Japanese &quot;T&quot; and thus achieved the tactical mastery of
a situation that almost every surface admiral dreams of. At 0413,
the &quot;Wee Vee&quot; ceased fire; the Japanese remnants
proceeded in disorder down the strait from whence they had come.
Several burning Japanese ships littered the strait; WEST VIRGINIA
had contributed to YAMASHIRO's demise, thus averaging her own
crippling in the Pearl Harbor attack.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WEST VIRGINIA had
thus taken part in the last naval engagement fought by
line-of-battle ships and, on the 29th, departed the Philippines
for Ulithi, in company with TENNESSEE and MARYLAND. Subsequently
heading for Espiritu Santo, in the New Hebrides, after Admiral
Ruddock had shifted his flag back from WEST VIRGINIA to MARYLAND,
the former underwent a period of upkeep in the floating drydock,
ABSD-1, for her damaged screws.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The &quot;Wee
Vee&quot; returned to the Philippines, via Manus, on 26 November,
resuming her patrols in Leyte Gulf and serving as part of the
antiaircraft screen for the transports and amphibious ships. At
1139 on the 27th, WEST VIRGINIA's antiaircraft guns splashed a
suicider and assisted in downing others while on duty the next
day.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Rear Admiral
Ruddock shifted back on board on the 30th, WEST VIRGINIA
maintaining her operations off Leyte until 2 December, when the
battleship headed for the Palaus. The battlewagon was then made
the flagship for the newly formed TG 77.12 and proceeded toward
the Sulu Sea to cover the landings made by the Southwest Pacific
Force on the island of Mindoro. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Entering Leyte
Gulf late on the evening of 12 December, WEST VIRGINIA transited
the Surigao Strait on the 13th and steamed into the Sulu Sea with
a carrier force to provide cover for the transports in TG 78.3.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">She subsequently
covered the retirement of the transports on 16 December, later
fueling in Leyte Gulf before she returned to Kossol Roads,
Palaus, at mid-day on the 19th. There, WEST VIRGINIA spent the
Christmas of 1944.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">There was more
work to be done, however, for the battleship, as the
&quot;return&quot; to the Philippines continued apace. On New
Year's Day, Rear Admiral Ingram C. Sowell relieved Rear Admiral
Ruddock as Commander, BatDiv 4, and the ship got underway for
Leyte Gulf as part of TG 77.2.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Entering the gulf
during the pre-dawn hours of 3 January, WEST VIRGINIA proceeded
into the Sulu Sea. Japanese air opposition, intensifying since
the early part of the Philippine campaign, was becoming more
deadly. WEST VIRGINIA's men saw evidence of that when a
twin-engined &quot;Frances&quot; crashed the escort carrier
OMMANEY BAY (CVE-79) at 1712 on the 4th. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Fires and
explosions ultimately forced the &quot;jeep carrier's&quot;
abandonment, her survivors being picked up by other ships in the
screen. BURNS (DD-588) dispatched the blazing CVE with torpedoes.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Taking on board
survivors from OMMANEY BAY from the destroyer TWIGGS (DD-591),
WEST VIRGINIA entered the South China Sea on the morning of the
following day, 5 January 1945, defending the carriers during the
day from Japanese air attacks. Subsequently, the battleship moved
close inshore with the carriers outside to carry out a
bombardment mission on San Fernando Point. WEST VIRGINIA hammered
Japanese installations ashore with her 16-inch rifles.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Suiciders,
however, kept up their attacks in the face of heavy antiaircraft
barrages and combat air patrol (CAP) fighters. Losses among
Allied shipping continued to mount; kamikazes claimed damage to
HMAS AUSTRALIA and the battleships CALIFORNIA and NEW MEXICO
(BB-40) on the 5th. WEST VIRGINIA participated in putting up
volumes of antiaircraft fire during those attacks, emerging
unscathed herself.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WEST VIRGINIA-in
addition to the OMMANEY BAY sailors on boardsoon took on board
another group of survivors from yet another ship: the men from
the high-speed minesweeper HOVEY (DMS-11) which had been sunk by
a Japanese torpedo on the 6th. Before she could transfer the
escort carrier's and minesweeper's sailors elsewhere, though, she
had to carry out her assigned tasks first. Accordingly, WEST
VIRGINIA's 16-inch rifles again hammered Japanese positions
ashore at San Fabian on the 8th and 9th, as troops went ashore on
the latter day. It was not until the night of 9 January that the
battleship finally transferred her passengers off the ship.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After providing
call fire support all day on the 10th, WEST VIRGINIA patrolled
off Lingayen Gulf for the next week before proceeding to an
anchorage where she replenished her ammunition. During her shore
bombardment tours off San Fabian, WEST VIRGINIA had proved
herself most helpful, covering UDT operations, destroying mortar
positions, entrenchments, gun emplacements, and leveling the town
of San Fabian. In addition, &quot;Wee Vee&quot; destroyed
ammunition dumps, railway and road junctions, and machine gun
positions and warehouses. During that time, the ship expended 395
16-inch shells and over 2,800 5-inch projectiles. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Underway again at
0707 on the 21st, WEST VIRGINIA commenced call-fire support
duties at 0815, operating in readiness for cooperation with the
Army units ashore in the vicinity of the towns of Rosario and
Santo Tomas. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After a few more
days of standing ready to provide call-fire support when needed,
WEST VIRGINIA anchored in Lingayen Gulf on 1
February.Subsequently, as part of TG 77.2, WEST VIRGINIA
protected the shipping arriving at the Lingayen beachheads and
stood ready to provide call-fire for the Army when needed. She
later departed Lingayen Gulf, her duty completed there, on 10
February, bound for Leyte Gulf. Before her departure, she
received 79 bags of United States mail-the first she had received
since the day before Christmas.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After touching
first at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, WEST VIRGINIA arrived at Ulithi on
16 February, reporting for duty with the 5th Fleet upon arrival. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Ordered to prepare
in all haste for another operation, the battleship provisioned
and refueled with the highest priority. The ship completed
loading some 300 tons of stores by 0400 on the 17th. At 0730 on
the 17th, WEST VIRGINIA got underway, bound for Iwo Jima in
company with the destroyers IZARD (DD-589) and MCCALL (DD-400).
As she headed off to Iwo Jima to join TF 51, WEST VIRGINIA
received a &quot;Well-done from Admiral Chester W. Nimitz for the
manner in which she had readied herself for her new duty after
being released from the 7th Fleet such a short time before.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WEST VIRGINIA
sighted Iwo Jima at a range of 82 miles at 0907 on 19 February.
As she drew nearer, she saw several ships bombarding the isle
from all sides and the initial landings taking place. At 1125,
she received her operations orders, via dispatch boat and, 20
minutes later, proceeded to her fire support station off the
volcanic sand beaches. At 1245, her big guns bellowed to lend
support to the marines ashore-gun positions, revetments,
blockhouses, tanks, vehicles, caves and supply dumps-all came
under her heavy guns. On 21 February, the ship returned and, at
0800, commenced her support duties afresh.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Her 16-inch shells
sealed caves, destroyed antiaircraft gun positions and
blockhouses; one salvo struck an ammunition or fuel dump,
explosions occurring for about two hours thereafter. On the 22d,
a small-caliber shell hit the battleship near turret II, wounding
one enlisted man. That same day, another significant event
occurred ashore-marines took Mount Suribachi, the prominent
landmark on one end of Iwo Jima. From their position offshore,
WEST VIRGINIA's sailors could see the flag flying from the top.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">For the remainder
of February, WEST VIRGINIA continued her daily fire-support
missions for the marines ashore. Again, Japanese positions felt
the heavy blows of the battleship's 16-inch shells. She hit troop
concentrations and trucks, blockhouses, trenches, and houses.
During the course of that time spent off the beaches on 27
February, she spotted a Japanese shore battery firing upon BRYANT
(DD-665). WEST VIRGINIA closed the range and, when about 600
yards from shore, opened fire with her secondary (5-inch)
battery, silencing the enemy guns.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Replenishing her
depleted ammunition stocks early on 28 February, WEST VIRGINIA
was back on the line again that afternoon, firing continuous
night harassing and interdiction rounds, silencing enemy
batteries with air bursts from her secondary batteries. For the
first three days of March, WEST VIRGINIA continued her
fire-support missions, primarily off the northeastern shore of
Iwo Jima. Finally, on 4 March, the ship set sail for the Caroline
Islands, reaching Ulithi on 6 March.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Joining TF 64 for
the invasion of the Okinawa Gunto area, WEST VIRGINIA sailed on
21 March, reaching her objective four days later on the 25th. In
fire support section one, WEST VIRGINIA spent the ensuing days
softening up Okinawa for the American landings slated to commence
on 1 April. At 1029 on 26 March, lookouts reported a gun flash
from shore, followed by a splash in the water some 6,000 yards
off the port bow. Firing her first salvos of the operation, WEST
VIRGINIA let fly 28 rounds of 16inch gunfire against the
pugnacious Japanese batteries.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The following day,
the &quot;Wee Vee&quot; fought against enemy air opposition,
taking a &quot;Frances&quot; under fire at 0520. The twin-engined
bomber crashed off the battleship's port quarter-the victim of
WEST VIRGINIA's anti-aircraft guns. Over the days that followed,
enemy opposition continued in the form of suicide attacks by
Japanese planes. Mines, too, began making themselves felt; one
sank the minesweeper SKYLARK (AM-68), 3,000 yards off WEST
VIRGINIA's port bow at 0930 on the 28th.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After taking on
ammunition at Kerama Retto-the island seized to provide an
advance base for the armada massing against OkinawaWEST VIRGINIA
sailed for Okinawa to give direct gunfire support to the
landings. Scheduled to fire at 0680, the battleship headed for
her assigned zone off the Okinawa beaches. While en route,
though, at 0455, she had to back down all engines when an
unidentified destroyer stood across her bow, thus avoiding a
collision.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As she prepared to
commence her bombardment, WEST VIRGINIA spotted a Japanese plane
off her port quarter her antiaircraft batteries tracked the
target and opened fire, downing the enemy aircraft 200 yards
away. Four more enemy planes passed within her vicinity soon
thereafter-WEST VIRGINIA claimed one of them.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Finally, at 0630,
WEST VIRGINIA opened fire as landing craft dotted the sea as far
as the eye could reach, all heading for the shores of Okinawa.
WEST VIRGINIA's sailors, some 900 yards off the beaches, could
see the craft heading shoreward like hundreds of tadpoles; at
0842, lookouts reported seeing some of the first troops going
ashore. The battle for Okinawa was underway.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WEST VIRGINIA
continued her bombardment duties throughout the day, on the alert
to provide counter-battery fire in support of the troops as they
advanced rapidly inland. There appeared to be little resistance
on 1 April, and WEST VIRGINIA lay to offshore, awaiting further
orders. At 1903, however, an enemy plane brought the war down on
WEST VIRGINIA.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The battleship
picked up three enemy planes on her radar and tracked them as
they approached; flak peppered the skies but still they came. One
crossed over the port side and then looped over and crash-dived
into WEST VIRGINIA, smashing into a superstructure deck just
forward of secondary battery director number two. Four men were
killed by the blast, and seven were wounded in a nearby
20-millimeter gun gallery. The bomb carried by the plane broke
loose from its shackle and penetrated to the second deck. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Fortunately, it
did not explode and was rendered harmless by the battleship's
bomb disposal officer. Although her galley and laundry looked
hard-hit, WEST VIRGINIA-reporting her damage as repairable by
ship's force-carried on, rendering night illumination fire to the
marines ashore.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WEST VIRGINIA
buried her dead at sea in the wake of the kamikaze attack of 1
April and resumed her gun-fire support duties soon thereafter. In
the course of her tour off shore in early April, she shot down a
&quot;Val&quot; on the 6th.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In early April,
the Japanese attempted to strike at the invasion fleet in a last
gasp offensive formed around the superbattleship YAMATO. On the
night of 7 and 8 April, WEST VIRGINIA steamed north and south in
the waters west of Okinawa ready to intercept and engage the
Japanese surface force headed her way. The next morning, 8 April,
Commander, TF 68, reported that most of the ships in that enemy
force had been sunk including YAMATO, whose last sortie had been
made with enough fuel to get her to Okinawa-but not to return,
Thus, the Japanese Navy's largest kamikaze perished-any miles
short of her objective.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">For WEST VIRGINIA,
however, her duties went on, providing illumination and
counterbattery fire with both main and secondary batteries and
giving her antiaircraft gunners a good workout due to the heavy
presence of many suiciders. Her TBS crackled with reports of
ships under attack and damaged-ZELLARS (DD-777), TENNESSEE, SALT
LAKE CITY (CA-24), STANLEY (DD-478) and others, all victims of
the &quot;divine wind,&quot; or kamikaze. Her shore bombardments
elicited nothing but praise from those enjoying the benefits of
the ship's firing; one spotter reported happily on 14 April:
&quot;You're shooting perfectly, you could shoot no better, no
change, no change,&quot; and, &quot;Your shooting is strictly
marvelous. I cannot express just how good it is.&quot; She
delivered sterling support fire for the 6th Marines upon that
occasion; later, she continued in that fine tradition for the
10th Army and the XXIVth Army Corps.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WEST VIRGINIA
continued fire support for the Army until 20 April, at which
point she headed for Ulithi, only to turn back to Okinawa,
hurriedly recalled because of COLORADO's (BB-45) suffering damage
when a powder charge exploded while she was loading powder at
Kerama Retto. Returning to Hagushi beach, WEST VIRGINIA fired
night harassment and interdiction fire for the 10th Army and the
XXIVth Army Corps. Ultimately, WEST VIRGINIA sailed for Ulithi,
in company with SAN FRANCISCO (CA-38) and HOBSON (DD-464),
reaching her destination-this time without a recall en route on
28 April.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Returning to
Okinawa after a brief sojourn at Ulithi, WEST VIRGINIA remained
in support of the Army and the Marines on the embattled island
into the end of June. There were highlights of the tour-on 1
June, she sent her spotting plane aloft to locate a troublesome
enemy blockhouse reportedly holding up an Army advance. A couple
of rounds hurled in the enemy's direction produced no results;
she had to settle for obliterating some of the enemy's motor
transport and troop concentrations during the day instead. The
next day, 2 June, while in support of the Army's XXIVth Corps,
WEST VIRGINIA scored four direct hits and seven near-misses on
the blockhouse that had been hit the day before.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WEST VIRGINIA then
operated off the southeast coast of Okinawa, breaking up Japanese
troop concentrations and destroying enemy caves. She also
disrupted Japanese road traffic by scoring a direct hit on a road
intersection and blasted a staging area. On 16 June, she was
firing an assignment for the 1st Marines off southwestern Okinawa
when her spotting plane, a Vought OS2U Kingfisher, took hits from
Japanese antiaircraft fire and headed down in flames, her pilot
and observer bailing out over enemyheld territory. Within a short
time, aided by PUTNAM (DD-757) and an LCI, WEST VIRGINIA closed
and blasted enemy guns in an attempt to rescue her plane crew who
had &quot;dug in for the day&quot; to await the arrival of the
rescuers. The attempt to recover her aircrew, however, was not
successful. Loaned a Kingfisher from TENNESSEE, WEST VIRGINIA
kept up her gunfire support activities for the balance of June.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Shifting to San
Pedro Bay, Leyte, at the end of June, the battleship reached her
destination on 1 July, escorted by CONNOLLY (DE-306). There, on
the morning of 5 July, she received her first draft of
replacements since Pearl Harbor in 1944. After loading
ammunition, WEST VIRGINIA commenced training in the Philippine
area, an activity she carried out through the end of July.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Sailing on 3
August for Okinawa, WEST VIRGINIA reached Buckner Bay on the 6th,
the same day that the first atomic bomb was dropped on the city
of Hiroshima. Three days later, a second bomb obliterated the
greater part of the city of Nagasaki. Those two events hastened
Japan's collapse. On 10 August, at 2115, WEST VIRGINIA picked up
a garbled report on radio that the Japanese government had agreed
to surrender under the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, provided
that they could keep the Emperor as their ruler. The American
ships in Buckner Bay soon commenced celebrating-the
indiscriminate use of antiaircraft fire and pyrotechnics (not
only from the naval vessels in the bay but from marines and Army
troops ashore) endangering friendly planes. Such celebrations,
however, proved premature-at 2004 on 12 August, WEST VIRGINIA
sailors felt a heavy underwater explosion; soon thereafter, at
2058, the battleship intercepted a radio dispatch from
PENNSYLVANIA (BB-38) reporting that she had been torpedoed. WEST
VIRGINIA sent over a whaleboat at 0023 on the 13th with pumps for
the damaged PENNSYLVANIA.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The war ended on
15 August 1945. WEST VIRGINIA drilled her landing force in
preparation for the upcoming occupation of the erstwhile enemy's
homeland and sailed for Tokyo Bay on the 24th as part of TG
35.90. She reached Tokyo Bay on the last day of August and was
thus present at the time of the formal surrender on 2 September
1945. For that occasion, five musicians from WEST VIRGINIA's band
were transferred temporarily to MISSOURI (BB-63) to play at the
ceremonies.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WEST VIRGINIA
played her part in the occupation, remaining in Tokyo Bay into
September of 1945, weathering a storm on the 15th that had winds
clocked at 65 knots at one point. On 14 September, she received
on board 270 passengers for transportation to the west coast of
the United States. She got underway at midnight on the 20th bound
for Okinawa as part of TG 30.4. Shifting to Buckner Bay on the
23d, the battleship sailed for Pearl Harbor soon thereafter,
reaching her destination on 4 October.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">There, the crew
painted ship and kept on board only those passengers slated for
transportation to San Diego, Calif. Bound for that port on the
9th, WEST VIRGINIA moored at the Navy Pier at San Diego at 1328
on 22 October. Two days later, Rear Admiral I. C. Sowell hauled
down his flag as Commander, BatDiv 4.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On Navy Day-27
October-25,554 visitors (more the next day) came on board the
ship. Three days later, on the 30th, she got underway for
Hawaiian waters to take her place as part of the &quot;Magic
Carpet&quot; operation returning veteran soldiers, sailors,
marines, and airmen home to the states. After one run between San
Diego and Pearl Harbor, WEST VIRGINIA made another, the second
time embarking Rear Admiral William W. Smith, who broke his flag
in the battleship for the return voyage to San Francisco, Calif.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">After making yet
another run between the west coast and Hawaii, WEST VIRGINIA
reached San Pedro Calif., on 17 December. There, she spent
Christmas debarking her third draft of passengers. The veteran
battlewagon upped-anchor on 4 January 1946 and sailed for
Bremerton, Wash. She reached her destination on the 12th and
commenced inactivation soon thereafter, shifting to Seattle,
Wash., on the 16th, where she moored alongside sistership
COLORADO.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WEST VIRGINIA
entered her final stages of inactivation in the latter part of
February 1946 and was decommissioned on 9 January 1947 and placed
in reserve, as part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She never again
received the call to active duty, remaining inactive until struck
from the Navy list on 1 March 1959. On 24 August 1959, she was
sold for scrapping to the Union Minerals and Alloys Corp. of New
York City.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">WEST VIRGINIA
(BB-48), although heavily damaged at Pearl Harbor and missing
much of the war, nevertheless earned five battle stars.</font></p>
