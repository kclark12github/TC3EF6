<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><em><strong>History</strong></em></font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">The third IOWA
(BB-61) was laid down at New York Navy Yard, 27 June 1940;
launched 27 August 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Henry A. Wallace, wife
of Vice President Wallace, and commissioned 22 February 1943,
Capt. John L. McCrea in command.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 24 February,
IOWA put to sea for shakedown in Chesapeake Bay and along the
Atlantic coast. She got underway, 27 August for Argentia,
Newfoundland to neutralize the threat of German Battleship
Tirpitz which was reportedly operating In Norwegian waters.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In the fall, IOWA
carried President Franklin D. Roosevelt to Casablanca, French
Morocco on the first leg of the journey to the Teheran Conference
in November. After the conference she returned the President to
the United States.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">As Flagship of
Battleship Division 7, IOWA departed the United States 2 January
1944 for the Pacific Theatre and her combat debut In the campaign
for the Marshalls. From 29 January to 3 February, she supported
carrier air strikes made by Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman's
task group against Kwajalein and Eniwetok Atolls in the Marshall
Islands. Her next assignment was to support air strikes against
the Japanese Naval base at Truk, Caroline Islands. IOWA, in
company with other ships was detached from the support group 16
February, 1944 to conduct an antishipping sweep around Truk to
destroy enemy naval vessels escaping to the north. n 21 February,
she was underway with Fast Carrier Task Force 58 while it
conducted the first strikes against Saipan, Tinian, Rota, and
Guam in the Marianas.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">On 18 March, IOWA,
flying the flag of Vice Admiral Willis A. Lee, Commander
Battleships, Pacific, joined in the bombardment of Mili Atoll in
the Marshall Islands Although struck by two Japanese 4.7 &quot;
projectiles during the action, IOWA suffered negligible damage.
She then rejoined Task Force 58, 30 March, and supported air
strikes against the Palau Islands and Woleai of the Carolines
which continued for several days.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">From 22 to 28
April 1944, IOWA supported air raids on Hollandia, Aitape, and
Wakde Islands to support Army forces on Aitape, Tanahmerah Bay,
and Humbolt Bay in New Guinea. She then joined the Task Force's
second strike on Truk, 00 April, and bombarded Japanese
facilities on Ponape in the Carolines, 1 May.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In the opening
phases of the Marianas campaign, IOWA protected the flattops
during air strikes on the islands of Saipan, Tinian, Guam, Rota,
and Pagan, 12 June. IOWA was then detached to bombard enemy
installations on Saipan and Tinian, 13-14 June. On 19 June, in an
engagement known as the Battle of the Philippine Sea, IOWA, as
part of the battle line of Fast Carrier Task Force 58, helped
repel four massive air raids launched by the Japanese Middle
Fleet. This resulted in the almost complete destruction of
Japanese carrier-based aircraft. IOWA then joined In the pursuit
of the fleeing enemy Fleet, shooting down one torpedo plane and
assisting in splashing another.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Throughout July,
IOWA remained off the Marianas supporting air strikes on the
Palaus and landings on Guam. After a month's rest, IOWA sortied
from Eniwetok as part of the 3d Fleet, and helped support the
landings on Peleliu, 17 September. She then protected the
carriers during air strikes against the Central Philippines to
neutralize enemy air power for the long awaited invasion of the
Philippines. On 10 October, IOWA arrived off Okinawa for a series
of air strikes on the Ryukyus and Formosa. She then supported air
strikes against Luzon, 18 October and continued this vital duty
during General Mac Arthur's landing on Leyte 20 October.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">In a last ditch
attempt to halt the United States campaign to recapture the
Philippines, the Japanese Navy struck back with a three-pronged
attack aimed at the destruction of American amphibious forces in
Leyte Gulf. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">IOWA accompanied
TF-38 during attacks against the Japanese Central Force as it
steamed through the Sibuyan Sea toward San Bernardino Strait. The
reported results of these attacks and the apparent retreat of the
Japanese Central Force led Admiral Halsey to believe that this
force had been ruined as an effective fighting group. IOWA, with
Task Force 38, steamed after the Japanese Northern Force off Cape
Engano, Luzon. On 25 October 1944, when the ships of the Northern
Force were almost within range of IOWA's guns, word arrived that
the Japanese Central Force was attacking a group of American
escort carriers off Samar. This threat to the American beachheads
forced her to reverse course and steam to support the vulnerable
&quot;baby carriers.&quot; However, the valiant fight put up by
the escort carriers and their screen had already caused the
Japanese to retire and IOWA was denied a surface action.
Following the Battle for Leyte Gulf, IOWA remained in the waters
off the Philippines screening carriers during strikes against
Luzon and Formosa. She sailed for the West Coast late in December
1944.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">IOWA arrived San
Francisco, 15 January 1945, for overhaul. She sailed 19 March
1945 for Okinawa, arriving 15 April 1945. Commencing 24 April
1945, IOWA supported carrier operations which assured American
troops vital air superiority during their struggle for that
bitterly contested Island. She then supported air strikes off
southern Kyushu from 25 May to 13 June 1945. IOWA participated in
strikes on the Japanese homeland 14-15 July and bombarded
Muroian, Hokkaido, destroying steel mills and other targets. The
city of Hitachi on Honshu was given the same treatment on the
night of 17-18 July 1945. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">IOWA continued to
support fast carrier strikes until the cessation of hostilities,
15 August 1945.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">IOWA entered Tokyo
Bay with the occupation forces, 29 August 1945. After serving as
Admiral William F. Halsey's flagship for the surrender ceremony,
2 September 1945, IOWA departed Tokyo Bay 20 September 1945 for
the United States.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Arriving Seattle,

aggression in Korea necessitated an expansion of the active
fleet, IOWA recommissioned 25 August 1951, Captain William R.
Smedberg III in command. She operated off the West Coast until
March 1952, when she sailed for the Far East. On 1 April 1952,
IOWA became the flagship of Vice Admiral Robert T, Briscoe,
Commander, 7th Fleet, and departed Yokosuka, Japan to support
United Nations Forces in Korea. From 8 April to 16 October 1952,
IOWA was involved in combat operations off the East Coast of
Korea. Her primary mission was to aid ground troops, by
bombarding enemy targets at Songjin, Hungnam, and Kojo, North
Korea. During this time, Admiral Briscoe was relieved as
Commander, 7th Fleet. Vice Admiral J. J. Clark, the new
commander, continued to use IOWA as his flagship until 17 October
1952. IOWA departed Yokosuka, Japan 19 October 1952 for overhaul
at Norfolk and training operations in the Caribbean Sea.</font></p>

midshipmen for at sea training to Northern Europe, July 1953, and
immediately after took part in Operation &quot;Mariner,&quot; a
major NATO exercise, serving as flagship of Vice Admiral E. T.
Woolridge, commanding the 2d Fleet. Upon completion of this

Capes area. In September 1954, she became the flagship of Rear
Admiral R. E. Libby, Commander, Battleship Cruiser Force, U. S.
Atlantic Fleet.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">From January to
April 1955, IOWA made an extended cruise to the Mediterranean as
the first battleship regularly assigned to Commander, 6th Fleet.
IOWA departed on a midshipman training cruise 1 June 1955 and
upon her return, she entered Norfolk for a 4-mouth overhaul.
Following refit, IOWA continued intermittent training cruises and
operational exercises, until 4 January 1957 when she departed
Norfolk for duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. Upon
completion of this deployment, IOWA embarked midshipmen for a
South American training cruise and joined in the International
Naval Review off Hampton Roads, Va., 13 June 1957.</font></p>
