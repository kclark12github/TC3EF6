The second BLOCK ISLAND (CVE-106) was launched 10 June 1944 as 
SUNSET BAY by Todd-Pacific Shipyards, Inc., Tacoma, Wash.; sponsored by 
Mrs. L. J. Hallenbeck; and commissioned as BLOCK ISLAND 30 December 
1944, Captain F. M. Hughes in command.
BLOCK ISLAND got underway for Pearl Harbor 20 March 1945.  Upon arrival 
she underwent a period of provisioning and training in preparations for the 
invasion of Okinawa.  On 17 April BLOCK ISLAND left Hawaii and steamed 
toward Okinawa, via Ulithi.  Flight operations commenced immediately 
upon her arrival 3 May and lasted until 16 June when she departed for 
Leyte.  After a brief stay at San Pedro Bay, the carrier steamed through the 
Straits of Makassar for Borneo.  Between 26 June and 6 July she took part 
in the Balikpapan operation.  She then proceeded to 
Guam where she was anchored at the time of the cessation of hostilities.  
During 6-9 September she took part in the evacuation of Allied prisoners of 
war from Formosa.  She continued cruising in the Far East until 14 October 
and arrived at San Diego 11 December 1945.  Leaving San Diego 5 January 
1946, she transited the Panama Canal and reached Norfolk on the 20th.  She 
was placed in service in reserve 28 May 1946.
