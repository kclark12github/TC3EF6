VERMILLION BAY (CVE-108) as renamed KULA GULF 6 November 1943; laid 
down by Todd-Pacific Shipyards, Inc., Tacoma, Wash., 16 December 1943; 
launched 15 August 1944- sponsored by Miss Dorothy Mott; completed by 
Williamette Iron & Steel Corp., Portland, Oreg.; and commissioned at 
Portland 12 May 1945, Captain J. W. Ring in command.
After shakedown and night carrier training off the West Coast, KULA GULF 
departed San Diego 5 August for operations with the 7th Fleet in the 
Western Pacific. Steaming via Pearl Harbor and the Marshalls, she arrived 
Leyte Gulf, Philippines, 14 September. During the net 2 months she patrolled 
the East China Sea out of Okinawa and shuttled planes between Saipan and 
Guam. Assigned to "Magic-Carpet" duty, she departed Guam 17 November 
with 600 veterans of the Pacific fighting embarked and steamed to San 
Francisco, arriving 4 December. Between 10 December and 10 January 1946 
she returned to the Far East, and, after embarking 1,520 returning veterans 
at Tientsin and Tsingtao, China, she sailed to the West Coast, reaching San 
Diego 26 January. She departed San Francisco for the East Coast 26 
February, arrived Norfolk 16 March, decommissioned at Boston 3 July, and 
entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.
When the Korean conflict brought an urgent need for a greatly expanded need 
throughout the world, KULA GULF recommissioned at Boston 15 February 
1951, Captain Alden D. Schwarz in command. After shakedown out of 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the escort carrier departed Norfolk 6 August and 
carried a cargo of airplanes ,to Casablanca, French Morocco. Following her 
return to Norfolk 1 September, she spent the next 15 months training pilots 
of helicopter, air-antisubmarine, and fighter squadrons to strengthen U.S. 
forces in Korea.
During May 1952 KULA GULF supported Marine helicopter maneuvers on 
Vieques Island, Puerto Rico; and in October she operated as ASW screen to 
troop transports bound for Labrador. Following a modernization overhaul 
from January to July 1953, she resumed air-antisubmarine maneuvers in the 
Caribbean and off the Atlantic coast.
From 1953 to 1955 KULA GULF helped perfect ASW techniques by 
participating in search and kill exercises with ships of the Atlantic Fleet. 
She played an important role in the development of more effective 
antisubmarine warfare tactics that help the Navy control the seas. In 
addition to ASW development, she also aided the advancement of helicopter 
warfare tactics, which are now so important during the struggle to repel 
Communist aggression in South Vietnam. KULA GULF supported Marine 
vertical assault landing exercises at Vieques Island between February and 
April 1955. After returning to Norfolk 26 April, 
she entered Boston Naval Shipyard 13 May and Philadelphia Naval Shipyard 
19 August for inactivation overhauls. She decommissioned at Philadelphia 
15 December 1955 and joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was 
reclassified AKV-8 on 7 May 1959.
As Communist aggression in South Vietnam increased, the United States 
expanded efforts to protect the integrity and independence of the Republic 
of South Vietnam. This assistance posed vast logistic demands and created 
the need for additional sea power. Because of this urgent need, KULA GULF 
was transferred to MSTS 30 June 1965 for use as an aircraft ferry. During 
the summer of 196 she carried helicopters and troops of the 1st Cavalry 
Division from the East Coast to Vietnam. Since then she has continued 
aircraft shuttle operations between West Coast ports and American bases 
along the coast of South Vietnam into 1967.
