GILBERT ISLANDS (CVE-107)
An island group containing 16 atolls in the western Pacific Ocean on the 
equator, southeast of the Marshalls and northeast of the Solomons. On 20 
November 1943 Marines made an amphibious assault on Makin and Tarawa 
Islands, seizing the former without difficulty, but winning Tarawa only 
after a 100-hour battle in which over 3,500 Americans were killed or 
wounded.

GILBERT ISLAND (CVE-107) was launched 20 July 1944 the Todd-Pacific 
Shipyards, Inc., Tacina, Wash.; sponsored by Mrs. Edwin D. McMorries; and 
commissioned 5 February 1945, Captain L. R. Rice in command.
After shakedown training, GILBERT ISLANDS departed San Diego 12 April 
1945 for exercises in Hawaiian waters. She sailed 2 May with an escort 
carrier force that closed Okinawa 21 May. Her aircraft (24-31 May) blasted 
and strafed concrete dugouts, troop concentrations, ammunition and fuel 
dumps on Okinawa. In the following days She helped neutralize outlying 
Japanese airfields and installations with repeated bomb and rocket attacks. 
Five of her Marine pilots were killed in action. She departed Okinawa 16 
June to replenish at San Pedro Bay, thence to Balikpapan, Borneo. She gave 
air cover to Australians storming that shore 1 July and remained 4 days to 
attack all targets in sight. With the Australians securely established, she 
returned to Leyte 6 July.
GILBERT ISLANDS departed San Pedro Bay 29 July to screen logistic ships 
replenishing 3d Fleet striking forces along the coast of Japan. On that 
station 15 August she joined a task group that included nearly all the 3d 
Fleet and heard Admiral Halsey's laconic direction: "Apparently the war is 
over and you are ordered to cease firing; so, if you see any Jap planes in the 
air, you will just have to shoot them down in a friendly manner." After 
replenishment at Okinawa, she departed 14 October to participate in a show 
of air strength during occupation of Formosa by the Chinese 70th Army. She 
was then routed onward via Saipan and Pearl Harbor to San Diego, arriving 4 
December 1945. She remained in port until 21 January 1946, then set course 
for Norfolk where she decommissioned 21 May 1946 and was placed in 
reserve.
Towed to Philadelphia in November 1949, GILBERT ISLANDS  recommissioned 
7 September 1951 and put in at Boston 25 November for overhaul. She joined 
the Atlantic Fleet 1 August 1952, sailed 8 days later with a cargo of jets 
for Yokohama, Japan, arriving 18 September, and returned to her homeport of 
Quonset Point, R.I., 22 October. She sailed 5 January 1953 for the Caribbean 
to conduct training exercises off Cuba and returned to New England waters 
to continue these duties through the summer and fall of the year. Following 
a cruise to Halifax and overhaul at Boston, the escort carrier stood out 5 
January 1954 for a Mediterranean cruise, returning to Quonset Point 12 
March 1954 for reserve training and other exercises. She became the first of 
her class to have jets make touch-and-go landings on the flight deck while 
she had no way on, a dangerous experiment successfully conducted 9 June 
1954.
She left Rhode Island 25 June for Boston and decommissioned there 15 
January 1955.
Reclassified AKV-39 7 May 1959, GILBERT ISLANDS remained in reserve 
until her name was struck from the Navy List June 1961. She was 
reclassified (AGMR-1) 1 June 19;3 and renamed ANNAPOLIS 22 June 1963. 
ANNAPOLIS recommissioned 7 March 1964, Captain John J. Rowan in 
command. As the Navy's first major communication relay ship, ANNAPOLIS 
was busy with acceptance trials for the rest of the year. In the fall she 
handled communications during Operation "Teamwork" and "Steel Pike" 
before final acceptance into the fleet 16 December.
After operations out of Norfolk during the first half of 1965, ANNAPOLIS 
was assigned Long Beach as home port 28 June 1965. In September she was 
sent to Viet Nam to assist communications between naval units fighting 
Communist aggression. With the exception of periodic visits to Hong Kong, 
Formosa, and the Philippines for upkeep and training, she continued this 
important service into 1967 assuring a smooth, steady and speed flow of 
information and orders so necessary to effective conduct of the war.
GILBERT ISLANDS received three battle stars for World War II service.
