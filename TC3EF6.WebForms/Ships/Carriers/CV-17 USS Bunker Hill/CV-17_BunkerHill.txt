BUNKER HILL (CV-17) was launched 7 December 1942 by Bethlehem Steel 
Co., Quincy, Mass.; sponsored by Mrs. Donald Boynton; and commissioned 24 
May 1943, Captain J. J. Ballentine in command.
Reporting to the Pacific in the fall of 1943 BUNKER HILL participated in 
carrier operations during the Rabaul strike (11 November 1943);  Gilbert 
Islands operation, including support of the landings on Tarawa (13 
November-8 December); the Kavieng strikes in support of the Bismarck 
Archipelago operation (25 December 1943, 1 and 4 January 1944);  Marshall 
Islands operation (29 January-8 February); strikes against Truk (17-18 
February); Palau-Yap-Ulithi-Woleai raids (30 March-1 April); Truk-
Satawan-Ponape (29 April-1 May); Hollandia operation (21-28 April); and 
Marianas operation (12 June-10 August), including the Battle of the 
Philippine Sea.  On 19 June 1944, during the opening phases of the battle, 
BUNKER HILL was damaged when an enemy near miss scattered shrapnel 
fragments across the ship. Two men were killed and over 80 were wounded.  
BUNKER HILL continued to do battle and her planes aided in sinking one 
Japanese carrier and destroying a part of the 475 Japanese aircraft that 
were downed.  During September she participated in the Western Caroline 
Islands operation and then launched strikes at Okinawa, Luzon, and Formosa 
until November.
On 6 November BUNKER HILL retired from the forward area and steamed to 
Bremerton, Wash., for a period of yard availability.  Repairs completed, she 
departed the west coast 24 January 1945 and returned to the war front.  
During the remaining months of World War II BUNKER HILL  participated in 
the Iwo Jima operation and the 5th Fleet raids against Honshu and the 
Nansei Shoto (15 February-4 March); and the 5th and 3rd Fleet raids in 
support of the Okinawan operation.  On 7 April 1945 BUNKER HILL's planes 
took part in a fast carrier task force attack on a Japanese naval force in the 
East China Sea.  The enemy battleship YAMATO, one cruiser, and four 
destroyers were sunk.
On the morning of 11 May 1945, while supporting the Okinawa invasion, 
BUNKER HILL was hit and severely damaged by two suicide planes.  Gasoline 
fires flamed up and several explosions took place.  The ship suffered the 
loss of 346 men killed, 43 missing, and 264 wounded.  Although badly 
crippled she managed to return to Bremerton via Pearl Harbor.
In September BUNKER HILL reported for duty with the "Magic-Carpet" fleet.  
She remained on this duty as a unit of TG 16.12 returning veterans from the 
Pacific until January 1946 when she was ordered to Bremerton for 
inactivation.  She was placed out of commission in reserve there 9 January 
1947.
BUNKER HILL received the Presidential Unit Citation for the period 11 
November 1943 to 11 May 1945.  In addition, she received 11 Battle stars 
for her World War II service.
