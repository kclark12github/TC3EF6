The eighth HORNET (CV-12) was launched 30 August 1943 by the Newport 
News Shipbuilding  Dry Dock Co. Newport News, Va., sponsored by Mrs. Frank 
M. Knox wife of the Secretary of the Navy; and commissioned 29 November 
1943, Captain Miles M. Browning in command.
HORNET conducted shakedown training off Bermuda before departing Norfolk 
14 February 1944 to join the Fast Carrier Task Force 20 March at Majuro 
Atoll in the Marshalls. After lending air support to protect the invasion 
beaches in New Guinea, she conducted massive aerial raids against Japanese 
bases in the Caroline Islands and prepared to support the amphibious assault 
for the occupation of the Marianas Islands
On 11 June 1944 HORNET launched raids on Tinian and Saipan. The following 
day she conducted heavy bombing attacks on Guam and Rota. During 15 to 16 
June, she blasted enemy air fields at Iwo and Chichi Jima to prevent air 
attacks on troops invading Saipan in the Marianas. The afternoon of 18 June 
1944 HORNET formed with the Fast Carrier Task Force to intercept the 
Japanese First Mobile Fleet, headed through the Philippine Sea for Saipan. 
The Battle of the Philippine Sea opened 19 June 1944 when HORNET launched 
strikes to destroy as many land-based Japanese planes as possible before 
the carrier-based Japanese aircraft came in.
The enemy approached the American carriers in four massive waves. But 
fighter aircraft from HORNET and other carriers did a magnificent job and 
broke up all the attacks before the Japanese aerial raiders reached the task 
force. Nearly every Japanese aircraft was shot down in the great air battles 
of 19 June 1944 that became commonly known as "The Marianas Turkey 
Shoot." As the Japanese Mobile Fleet fled in defeat on 20 June, the carriers 
launched long-range airstrikes that sank Japanese carrier HIJI and so 
damaged two tankers that they were abandoned and scuttled. Admiral 
Ozawa's own flag log for 20 June 1944 showed his surviving carrier air 
power as only 35 operational aircraft out of the 430 planes with which he 
had commenced the Battle of the Philippine Sea.
HORNET, basing from Eniwetok in the Marshalls, raided enemy installations 
ranging from Guam to the Bonins then turned her attention to the Palaus, 
throughout the Philippine Sea, and to enemy bases on Okinawa and Formosa. 
Her aircraft gave direct support to the troops invading Leyte 20 October 
1944. During the Battle for Leyte Gulf she launched raids for damaging hits 
to the Japanese center force in the Battle off Samar, and hastened the 
retreat of the enemy fleet through the Sibuyan Sea towards Borneo.
In the following months HORNET attacked enemy shipping and airfields 
throughout the Philippines. This included participation in a raid that 
destroyed an entire Japanese convoy in Ormoc Bay. On 30 December 1944 she 
departed Ulithi in the Carolines for raids against Formosa, IndoChina, and 
the Pescadores Islands. In route back to Ulithi, HORNET planes made photo 
reconnaissance of Okinawa 22 January 1945 to aid the planned invasion of 
that "last stepping-stone to Japan."

HORNET again departed Ulithi 10 February for full-scale aerial assaults on 
Tokyo, then supported the amphibious landing assault on Iwo Jima 1920 
February 1945. Repeated raids were made against the Tokyo plains 
industrial complex, and Okinawa was hard hit. On 1 April 1945 HORNET 
planes gave direct support to the amphibious assault landings on Okinawa. 
On 6 April her aircraft joined in attacks which sank the mighty Japanese 
battleship YAMATO and her entire task force as it closed Okinawa. The 
following 2 months found HORNET alternating between close support to 
ground troops on Okinawa and hard-hitting raids to destroy the industrial 
capacity of Japan. She was caught in a howling typhoon 4 to 5 June 1945 
which collapsed some 25 feet of her forward flight deck.
HORNET was routed back to the Philippines and from there to San Francisco, 
arriving 7 July 1945. Her overhaul was complete by 13 September 1945 
when she departed as a part of the "Magic Carpet" operation that saw her 
return home troops from the Marianas and Hawaiian Islands. She returned to 
San Francisco 9 February 1946. She decommissioned there 15 January 1947, 
and joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet.
HORNET recommissioned 20 March 1951, then sailed from San Francisco for 
the New York Naval Shipyard where she decommissioned 12 May 1951 for 
conversion to an attack aircraft carrier (CVA-12). She recommissioned 11 
September 1953 and trained in the Caribbean Sea before departure from 
Norfolk 11 May 1954 on an 8-month global cruise.
After operations in the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, HORNET 
joined the mobile 7th fleet in the South China Sea where 25 July, search 
planes from her task group shot down two attacking Chinese Communist 
fighter planes. She returned to San Francisco 12 December 1954, trained out 
of San Diego, then sailed 4 May 1955 to join the 7th fleet in the Far East.
HORNET helped cover the evacuation of Vietnamese from the Communist 
controlled north to freedom in South Vietnam, then ranged from Japan to 
Formosa, Okinawa, and the Philippines in readiness training with the 7th 
fleet. She returned to San Diego 10 December 1965 and entered the Puget 
Sound Naval Shipyard the following month for conversion that included a 
hurricane bow and the installation of an angled flight deck which permits 
the simultaneous launching and recovery of aircraft.
Following her modernization overhaul, HORNET operated along the California 
coast. She departed San Diego 21 January 1967 to bolster the strength of 
the 7th fleet until her return from the troubled Far East 25 July. Following a 
similar cruise, 6 January-2 July 1958, she was converted to an 
Antisubmarine Warfare Support Carrier (CVS-12) in the Puget Sound Naval 
Shipyard. On 3 April 1959 she sailed from Long Beach to join the 7th fleet in 
antisubmarine warfare tactics ranging from Japan to Okinawa and the 
Philippines. She returned home in October, for training along the western 
seaboard.
In the following years, HORNET was regularly deployed to the 7th fleet for 
operations ranging from the coast of South Vietnam, to the shores of Japan, 
the Philippines and Okinawa. On 25 August 1966 she was on recovery station 
for the unmanned Apollo moonship that rocketed threequarters of the way 
around the globe in 93 minutes before splashdown near Wake Island. 
Scorched from the heat of its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, the 
Apollo space capsule, designed to carry American astronauts to the moon, 
was brought aboard HORNET after its test.
HORNET returned to Long Beach 8 September, but headed back to the Far East 
27 March 1967. She reached Japan exactly a month later and departed Sasebo 
19 May for the war zone. She operated in Vietnamese waters throughout the 
remainder of spring and during much of the summer of 1967 aiding in the 
struggle to keep freedom alive in Southeast Asia.

HORNET received the Presidential Unit Citation and seven battle stars 
for service in World War II.
