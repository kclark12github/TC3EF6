<p><font size="2" face="Arial">(NOTE: This file updates
ENTHST.TXT, which was uploaded in January 1990. This revised
edition of the history of ships named &quot;Enterprise&quot;
updates the histories of the starships NCC-1701B and NCC-1701C
and adds brief sections on several privately-owned ships.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Based on my latest count, there
have been 37 naval vessels and at least 21 privately-owned
vessels named &quot;Enterprise.&quot; According to information
from official naval museums in the respective countries, the
first confirmed &quot;Enterprise&quot; was a 1705 ship of the
French Navy that was captured by the British Royal Navy and
became the first &quot;HMS Enterprise.&quot; The most recent
&quot;Enterprise&quot; is, of course, our beloved 2364 starship
NCC-1701D. Each of the ships in this 659 time period had a unique
and fascinating history. As you read on, you will soon realize
that the missions and patrols carried out by each ship are a
reflection of the state of international relations and maritime
technology at that point in time. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In his &quot;Enterprise
Legacy&quot;, Ronald Roden mentions an &quot;HMS Enterprise&quot;
which sailed to the Far East around 1616 and was lost in a storm
near India. However, my research did not turn up any evidence of
such a vessel. My primary sources of information were official
ship histories of the &quot;USS Enterprises&quot; from the U.S.
Naval Historical Center in Washington, DC; official ship
histories of the &quot;HMS Enterprises&quot; from the National
Maritime Museum and the Imperial War Museum in London, England;
and popularly-accepted ship histories of the Starfleet
&quot;Enterprises&quot; as given in various publications related
to &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Information on the French
&quot;Enterprises&quot; was provided by the Musee de la Marine in
Paris and the Service Historique de la Marine in Vincennes,
France. </font></p>

<h2 align="center"><font face="Arial">***** THE FRENCH
ENTERPRISES *****</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The French Navy has had eight
vessels named &quot;Enterprise&quot; (spelled
&quot;Entreprise&quot;). Most of these were sailing ships of the
18th and early 19th Centuries. The last such ship was a
steam-powered craft requisitioned during World War I. Following
is a list of the known French &quot;Enterprises&quot;.
Unfortunately, more detailed specifications and ship histories
have not survived. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTREPRISE&quot; -
1705 - Frigate </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This ship was a 24-gun frigate
which sailed under French flag until May 1705, when she was
captured by the British Royal Navy. She continued to serve with
the Royal Navy until 1707. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTREPRISE&quot; -
1759 - Frigate </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This &quot;Entreprise&quot; was
another frigate which served under French flag. Her size and
armament are unknown. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTREPRISE&quot; -
1792 - Aviso </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This vessel served with the French
Navy for two years. An &quot;aviso&quot; was a class of sailing
vessel used as a dispatch or advice boat. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTREPRISE&quot; -
1796 - Chasee-Maree </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This &quot;Entreprise&quot; was
originally called the &quot;Saint Jean-de-Luz&quot;. She sank on
August 3, 1796, while enroute to England. A
&quot;chasee-maree&quot; was a sailing vessel of 1, 2, or 3 masts
with 4-sided sails mounted on yard- arms which were hung from the
masts at an oblique angle. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTREPRISE&quot; -
1797 - Corsair </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This ship served at a time when
French corsairs routinely attacked shipping from other countries,
including the United States. Corsairs were generally privateers
authorized by their governments to prey upon commercial shipping.
</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTREPRISE&quot; -
1798 - Felucca </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The sixth French
&quot;Entreprise&quot; also served at the time of French pirate
activities. A &quot;felucca&quot; was a narrow vessel used
primarily in the Mediterranean Sea. It generally had three masts
with triangular sails and provision for the use of oars. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTREPRISE&quot; -
1800 - Sloop </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This ship, originally called the
&quot;Brest&quot;, served as a transport ship from 1800 until
1807. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTREPRISE&quot; -
1917 - Trawler </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Similar to the British Royal Navy,
the French Navy requisitioned various fishing vessels to perform
official duties during World War I. The last French
&quot;Entreprise&quot; was a trawler which served from 1917 to
1920. </font></p>

<h2 align="center"><font face="Arial">** THE BRITISH ENTERPRISES
*****</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;HMS ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1705
to 1707 - 24-gun Frigate </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first ship confirmed to have
served with the Royal Navy as the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was a
24-gun frigate captured from France in May 1705. She was also
called the &quot;Enterprise&quot; (spelled
&quot;Entreprise&quot;) while in French service. She was 100 feet
long and carried a crew of 115 men. She served in the
Mediterranean, and was engaged in action near Leghorn, Italy on
May 19 and 20, 1707. She was wrecked off Thornton in the
Mediterranean on October 12, 1707. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;HMS ENTERPRIZE&quot;
- 1709 to 1740 - 40-gun Frigate </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The second &quot;HMS
Enterprize&quot; was a 188-foot frigate which carried 40 guns and
a crew of 190. (As was true of many early British
&quot;Enterprises&quot;, her name was spelled with a
&quot;z&quot; instead of an &quot;s&quot;.) She was built at
Plymouth, England and commissioned on April 28, 1709. She
patrolled the coast of Virginia from 1709 to 1712, then sailed in
British waters until 1720. At that time she returned to patrol
off the coast of Virginia. On February 20, 1724 she was renamed
&quot;Liverpool&quot; and continued in service as a hospital ship
until 1748. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;HMS ENTERPRIZE&quot;
- 1743 to 1748 - 8-gun Sloop </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Records on the third &quot;HMS
Enterprize&quot; are very sketchy. However, this ship was a small
sloop captured (possibly from Spain) in 1743. She had a crew of
60 men and took part in the Battle of Toulon on February 11,
1744. She was used primarily in the Mediterranean, and was sold
in 1748. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;HMS ENTERPRIZE&quot;
- 1744 to 1764 - 44-gun Frigate </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The fourth &quot;HMS
Enterprize&quot; was originally built in 1693 as the
&quot;Norwich&quot;. She was renamed &quot;Enterprize&quot; on
May 23, 1744. She was 130 feet long, with a crew of 250. She set
sail for Jamaica and patrolled the Caribbean until 1757. She
sailed to Nova Scotia in June of that year, then in July 1758
returned to the Caribbean. In 1761 she went home to English
waters and again return to the Caribbean in January 1762. Between
June 6 and August 13, 1763, she participated in action off
Havana, Cuba. The &quot;Enterprize&quot; was decommissioned in
January 1764 and broken up in 1771. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;HMS ENTERPRIZE&quot;
- 1775 to 1807 - 26-gun Frigate </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The fifth &quot;HMS
Enterprize&quot; was a 120-foot frigate built at Deptford,
England and commissioned in April 1775. She served for several
years in the Mediterranean, and participated in the siege of
Gibraltar. In April 1782, she set out for the Caribbean, where
she captured the privateer vessel &quot;Mohawk&quot;. From 1790,
she was assigned harbor patrol duties in British waters. She was
retired and broken up in August 1807. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;HMS ENTERPRIZE&quot;
- 1807 to 1816 - Frigate </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Very little information remains
about the sixth &quot;HMS Enterprize&quot;. She was probably
about 120 feet long, with 25 to 30 guns. It is known that she was
originally built as the &quot;Resource&quot; in 1778 and renamed
&quot;Enterprize&quot; in 1807. She was assigned harbor patrol
duties until she was sold on August 28, 1816. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;HMS ENTERPRISE&quot;
- 1848 to 1860 - Survey Ship </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The seventh &quot;HMS
Enterprise&quot; was a 126-foot survey and exploration ship which
served her entire active career exploring the Canadian Arctic
regions. In 1845, noted British explorer Sir John Franklin set
out to find the Northwest Passage. However, his expedition was
never heard from again. As a result, the British Government
mounted an extensive search campaign which lasted 12 years. The
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was commissioned in April 1848, and was
the lead ship in one of the search expeditions. First commanded
by Sir James Ross (from 1848 to 1849) and then by Captain Richard
Collinson (from 1849 to 1860) the &quot;Enterprise&quot;
traversed the islands of the Canadian Arctic regions searching
for clues of Sir Franklin's lost expedition and also surveying
and charting the region. It can be said, then, that this was the
first &quot;Enterprise&quot; to carry out the type of exploratory
cruises for which starships &quot;Enterprise&quot; are so well
known. She was converted to a coal carrying hulk in 1860, and
remained in that duty until she was sold in 1903. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;HMS ENTERPRISE&quot;
- 1864 to 1886 - Ironclad Sloop </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The eighth &quot;HMS
Enterprise&quot; was the first iron-hulled
&quot;Enterprise&quot;. She was a 180-foot sail and steam-powered
ship designed for coastal defense duties. She was originally
begun as a wooden-hulled ship in 1861, renamed
&quot;Circassian&quot; in 1862, and then canceled in 1863.
Construction began again in 1864, at which time she was completed
as an ironclad with the name &quot;Enterprise&quot; restored. She
patrolled coastal waters in the Mediterranean until she was sold
in November 1886. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;HMS ENTERPRISE&quot;
- 1899 to 1919 - Screw Tug </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The ninth &quot;HMS
Enterprise&quot; was a 110-foot steam-powered screw-driven tug
which was constructed at the McLachlan Dock Yards in October
1899. She served as a dock yard tug until 1919, when she was
renamed &quot;Emprise&quot;. She continued in service with this
new name until she was sold in 1947. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;HMS ENTERPRISE&quot;
- 1914 to 1918 - Drifter </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">During World War I, the Royal Navy
requisitioned a number of small vessels for auxiliary duties.
Among these were two drifters (fishing vessels) which carried the
name &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The first ship was purchased in 1914
and served until 1918, when she was renamed
&quot;Entertain&quot;. The second drifter was purchased in 1915
and served until March 8, 1916, when she was sunk by an enemy
mine off Brindisi, Italy. There was a third drifter called
&quot;Enterprising&quot;, which served from 1914 to 1919 and may
have served again from 1940 to 1947. (In my count, I consider
these three small ships as one entry.) </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;HMS ENTERPRISE&quot;
1919 to 1946 - Light Cruiser </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Perhaps the most significant
&quot;HMS Enterprise&quot; was the eleventh, which was a 570-foot
&quot;E-class&quot; light cruiser. She was commissioned in
December 1919. In April 1926, she was assigned to the East Indies
and patrolled the area until 1937. During 1936 and 1937, she
served as flagship for Vice-Admiral Sir Ramsey. The
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was active and served proudly during World
War II. Between 1940 and 1942, she served on the Halifax Escort
Force and was damaged by a near miss during operations off
Norway. On December 28, 1943, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the
cruiser &quot;Glasgow&quot; engaged a German convoy in the Bay of
Biscay. Although the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and
&quot;Glasgow&quot; were under attack by German planes, they
managed to sink a German destroyer and two fleet torpedo boats.
The &quot;Enterprise&quot; also participated on the D-Day
landings at Normandy in June 1944. She was sold on April 11,
1946. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>&quot;HMS ENTERPRISE&quot;
- 1958 to circa 1986 - Survey Ship </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The twelfth and last &quot;HMS
Enterprise&quot; was an &quot;E-class&quot; hydrographic survey
ship. She was 100-feet long and was equipment with sonar and
fathometers for coastal patrol duties. She could also be rigged
with armament and equipment to serve as a minesweeper in time of
war. She was commissioned in September 1958 and served until she
was retired sometime around 1986. </font></p>

<h2 align="center"><font face="Arial">***** THE AMERICAN
ENTERPRISES *****</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1775 TO
1777 - 12-gun Sloop </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first American
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was a 62-foot sloop captured from the
British at St. Johns, Canada on May 18, 1775. Available records
suggest that she was given the name &quot;Enterprise&quot; by
Colonel Benedict Arnold at the time of her capture. On August 28,
1775, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and two other ships captured by
Colonel Arnold's Continental Army troops carried over 1,000 men
who were part of an attack against St. Johns, Montreal, and
Quebec. The arrival of strong British reinforcements eventually
forced these ships to withdraw in the spring of 1776. At
Ticonderoga, Colonel Arnold built up a larger fleet and again
entered battle with the British on October 11, 1776, near
Plattsburg, New York. Though greatly inferior in terms of
firepower, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the other ships in
Arnold's fleet fought off the British all day long and slipped
through the British lines at night. Over the next two days, a
running battle continued, which resulted in the loss of all but
five of the American ships. Arnold again withdrew the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; and the four other remaining ships to
Ticonderoga. Although this had been a tactical defeat, it was a
great strategic victory. The small fleet had so disrupted the
British invasion into New York that it was nearly a year before
another attack could be mounted by the British. By that time,
additional American troops had been recruited and trained. This
led to the eventual American victory at Saratoga on October 17,
1777. During the British advances prior to the Battle of
Saratoga, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and four other vessels were
assigned convoy duty on Lake Champlain. On July 7, 1777, she was
run aground at Skenesboro and burned by her crew to prevent her
capture by the British. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1776 to
1777 - 8-gun Schooner </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Very little is known about the
second &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Incomplete records indicate that
she was an 8-gunned privateer schooner purchased by the
Continental Congress on December 20, 1776. She operated primarily
in Chesapeake Bay, and among her assignments the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; convoyed transport ships, carried out
various reconnaissance missions against the British, and guarded
the shores of the Chesapeake from British raids. The
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was returned to the Maryland Council of
Safety sometime in February 1777, just two months after she was
purchased. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;USS ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1799
to 1823 - 12-gun Schooner </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The third &quot;USS
Enterprise&quot; was an 85-foot schooner, which was also known as
the &quot;Lucky Little Enterprise&quot;. Shortly after the end of
the American Revolutionary War, the French Revolution began. The
French revolutionaries had little respect for international law
and soon began seizing American ships. By 1799, this matter had
reached the stage of an undeclared war, and the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed on December 17, 1799, to the
Caribbean. There, she saw action against the French, capturing
eight French privateer ships and recapturing 11 American
merchantmen. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; was next assigned to the
Mediterranean. The first action of this cruise occurred on August
1, 1801. During a fierce battle, from which the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; emerged unscathed, she captured the
corsair ship &quot;Tripoli&quot;. The &quot;Enterprise&quot;
continued to patrol the Mediterranean and on January 17, 1803,
captured the &quot;Paulina&quot;, a ship under charter to the
leader of Tripoli. On May 22, 1803, she ran a 30- ton craft
aground on the shore of Tripoli. On December 23, 1803, under
command of Lt. Stephen Decatur, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and
&quot;Constitution&quot; together captured the Tripolitan vessel
&quot;Mastico&quot;. The &quot;Mastico&quot; was renamed
&quot;Intrepid&quot; and was used to mount an expedition into
Tripoli to burn the frigate &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, which had
been captured. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; continued to patrol the
Barbary Coast and joined other ships in general attacks on
Tripoli in July 1804. She spent most of the winter of 1804 in
Venice, where she was almost completely rebuilt by May 1805. She
then returned to duty in the Mediterranean and fought a brief
battle with Spanish gunboats off Gibraltar on August 15, 1806.
The &quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to the United States in late
1807 and patrolled the coastal waters until June 1809. In 1811,
just prior to the outbreak of the War of 1812, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; entered the Washington Navy Yard, where
she was reconstructed as a brig, growing eight feet in length and
gaining more advanced armament. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; then
saw action in the War of 1812. On September 5, 1813, she engaged
in a fierce battle with the newly-built British brig
&quot;Boxer&quot;. During the battle, which saw the death of the
commanders of both ships, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; captured the
&quot;Boxer&quot; and took her to nearby Portland, Maine. A
common funeral was held for both Lt. William Burrows, the
&quot;Enterprise's&quot; commander, and the &quot;Boxer's&quot;
Captain Samuel Blythe. After repairs in Portland, Maine, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; and the brig &quot;Rattlesnake&quot;
sailed for the Caribbean. They captured three enemy ships before
being separated by a heavily armed ship on February 25, 1814. The
&quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to the United States, where she
patrolled the waters near Charleston, South Carolina for the
remainder of the War. After the end of the War of 1812, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was again pressed into service in the
Mediterranean from July to November 1815, then cruised the
northeastern U.S. coast until November 1817. After that, she
sailed the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico against pirates and
smugglers, capturing 13 vessels in the process. The &quot;Lucky
Little Enterprise&quot; ended her almost 1/4 century of proud
service, when she ran aground and broke up on Little Curacao
Island in the West Indies on July 9, 1823. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;USS ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1831
to 1844 - 8-gun Schooner </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The fourth &quot;USS
Enterprise&quot; was an 88-foot schooner built at the New York
Navy Yard and commissioned on December 15, 1831. She sailed for
South America on January 12, 1832, and patrolled the Brazilian
coast until April 1834, protecting American shipping and citizens
during conflicts between Brazil and Uruguay. After repairs in New
York, she returned to the Brazilian patrol in July 1834. Ten
months later, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the sloop
&quot;Peacock&quot; set sail for the Far East by way of Africa,
India, and the East Indies. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; continued
eastward across the Pacific and stopped in Honolulu, Hawaii in
September 1836. She then proceeded to the west coast of Mexico
and began a patrol of the west coast of South America. After
rounding Cape Horn, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; stopped at Rio de
Janeiro enroute to Philadelphia. There, she was decommissioned on
July 12, 1839. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; was recommissioned on
November 29, 1839. After four more years of protecting American
shipping interests off the coast of South America, she entered
the Boston Navy Yard in June 1844 and was eventually sold on
October 28, 1844. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;USS ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1877
to 1909 - Screw Sloop </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The fifth &quot;USS
Enterprise&quot; was a 185-foot sail and steam-powered sloop-
of-war commissioned, on March 16, 1877. Her first duty took her
to the mouth of the Mississippi River, where she conducted survey
operations. In May 1878, she sailed up the Amazon and Madeira
Rivers in South America on survey duties. She joined the U.S.
naval force in European waters in December 1878, making numerous
calls in northern Europe and the Mediterranean. The
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was decommissioned (for the first of many
times) at the Washington Navy Yard in May 1880. She was
recommissioned in January 1882 and spent a year cruising the U.S.
east coast. On January 1, 1883, she set sail on a hydrographic
survey that took her around the world. The results of her survey
added considerably to existing knowledge about the oceans and
ocean currents. She was again decommissioned in March 1886 and
then reactivated in October 1887. In January 1888, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed for European waters and the
Mediterranean, where she cruised for two years showing the flag.
After this cruise, she was again decommissioned in March 1890.
The &quot;Enterprise&quot; was recommissioned for the final time
in July 1890 and operated for a year in the Caribbean. From
September 1891 to September 1892, she served as the training ship
of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. On October 17,
1892, she was lent to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as a
maritime training vessel. She served in this capacity for some 17
years and was finally sold on October 1, 1909. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;USS ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1916
to 1919 - Motor Patrol Boat </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The sixth &quot;USS
Enterprise&quot; was a 66-foot motor patrol boat purchased by the
U.S. Navy on December 6, 1916. She performed harbor tug duties at
Newport, Rhode Island until December 1917, when she was moved to
Bedford, Massachusetts. She was transferred to the Bureau of
Fisheries on August 2, 1919. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;USS ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1938
to 1947 - Aircraft Carrier CV-6 </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The seventh &quot;USS
Enterprise&quot;, also known as the &quot;Big E&quot;, was the
second Yorktown-class aircraft carrier. She was commissioned on
May 12, 1938, and served gallantly during World War II, seeing
much action against the Japanese fleet in the Pacific. The
&quot;Enterprise&quot; had just completed delivering aircraft to
Wake Island and was enroute back to Pearl Harbor when the
Japanese attacked on December 7, 1941. While she was fortunate to
have been at sea during the attack and did not encounter any
surface ships, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; did score a kill by
sinking the Japanese submarine &quot;I-170&quot; on December 10,
1941. On January 11, 1942, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed from
Hawaii to protect convoys sent to reinforce Samoa. On February 1,
she dealt a hard blow to the Japanese in the Marshall Islands,
sinking three ships and damaging eight others. During the next
month, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; blasted enemy installations on
Wake Island. After repairs and minor modifications, she
rendezvoused with the &quot;Hornet&quot; on April 6, 1942, and
provided air cover while the &quot;Hornet&quot; launched B-25
bombers on a raid against Tokyo. With Rear Admiral Raymond
Spruance aboard, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was deployed on June
4, 1942, with the &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; at
the Battle of Midway. Her torpedo bombers suffered heavy losses.
However, her dive bombers helped sink the Japanese carriers
&quot;Akagi&quot;, &quot;Kaga&quot;, and &quot;Hiryu&quot;. Off
Guadalcanal on August 24, 1942, &quot;Enterprise&quot; suffered
several hits from Japanese bombers, but she was repaired at Pearl
Harbor and joined in the Battle of Santa Cruz just two months
later. Although she was hit again during that battle, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; continued in action and took aboard planes
from the &quot;Hornet&quot;, which had to be abandoned. By the
time the naval battles off Guadalcanal had ended on November 15,
1942, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; had shared in sinking 16 enemy
ships, among them the Japanese battleship &quot;Hiei&quot;, and
damaging 8 more. On May 27, 1943, Admiral Chester Nimitz
presented the &quot;Enterprise&quot; with the first Presidential
Unit Citation awarded to an aircraft carrier. In July 1943, she
entered the Puget Sound Navy Yard for major repairs. Returning to
action in November 1943, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; introduced
carrier night operations by launching a 3-plane force against
Japanese land-based bombers. She again made carrier aviation
history on February 17, 1944, when she launched 12 torpedo
bombers on a night radar bombing attack against the Japanese
naval base at Truk. Planes from the &quot;Enterprise&quot;
accounted for 1/3 of the 200,000 tons of shipping destroyed by
the task force during that raid. On June 19, 1944, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; took part in what is considered as the
greatest carrier aircraft battle in history. After 8 hours of
combat in the skies near Saipan, the United States Navy had lost
130 planes and crew and had 6 ships damaged. However, the
Japanese lost 3 carriers and 426 planes. Japanese naval aviation
never recovered from this defeat. The &quot;Enterprise&quot;
participated in other action near Palau in September and October
1944, at Leyte Gulf in October 1944, and Manila and Yap in
November 1944. She also supported the landing at Iwo Jima in
February 1945, keeping aircraft aloft for a continuous 174 hours.
A kamikaze hit on May 14, 1945, blew out her forward elevator and
kept her in dock until after the end of the War. The
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was restored to peak condition and sailed
to Pearl Harbor to bring home 1,000 troops. She then set sail for
Europe, where she participated in the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot;
operation, bringing home more than 10,000 servicemen in her final
service. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; was decommissioned on
February 17, 1947, and placed in reserve. She never saw
operational service again. She was sold for scrap on July 1,
1958, after unsuccessful attempts to have her preserved as a
memorial. (Author's Note: The novel &quot;Final Frontier&quot; by
Diane Carey is in error in stating, on page 153, that the World
War II aircraft carrier &quot;USS Enterprise&quot; was sold to
the Japanese for scrap. According to the Ships' Histories Branch
of the U.S. Naval Historical Center, the &quot;Enterprise&quot;
was sold to a New Jersey company.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;USS ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1951
to 2005 - Aircraft Carrier CVN-65 </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The eighth &quot;USS
Enterprise&quot; was commissioned on November 25, 1961, as the
world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Her hull and 4.5
acre flight deck design were that of the Kitty Hawk-class of
conventionally-powered carriers. However, her square
superstructure gave the &quot;Enterprise&quot; a unique profile.
On February 20, 1962, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; played a role in
the early history of space exploration by serving as a tracking
ship for the United States' first orbital mission, John Glenn's
3-orbit flight in &quot;Friendship 7&quot;. She next joined the
Sixth Fleet on patrol in the Mediterranean Sea. In October 1962,
the &quot;Enterprise&quot; participated in the blockade of Cuba
and on May 13, 1964, set sail with the nuclear-powered cruiser
&quot;Long Beach&quot; and frigate &quot;Bainbridge&quot; on
Operation Sea Orbit. This historic 32,000 mile voyage took the
task force on an around the world cruise without a single
refueling. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; was transferred to the
Seventh Fleet in the Pacific in November 1965. On December 2,
1965, she became the first nuclear-powered ship to engage in
combat, launching 125 air sorties against Viet Cong targets. The
very next day, she set a record by launching 165 sorties in a
single day. While off Hawaii in January 1969, a fire caused by a
missile explosion destroyed her aft flight deck. After extensive
repairs, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to action off
Vietnam. In all, she made six combat patrols to Southeast Asia
and earned five battle stars and two Navy Unit Commendations. Her
last strike of the war was made in 1973. Beginning in January
1979, she underwent a 3-year overhaul and refit, including
modernization of her nuclear reactors. Unknown to her crew, in
1986 the carrier &quot;Enterprise&quot; provided the rebel crew
of the 23rd Century starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; with the
nuclear fuel they needed to successfully complete the time travel
episode that occurred during the Whalesong Incident. In April
1988, she was assigned to escort reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers in
the Persian Gulf, protecting them from Iranian or Iraqi attacks.
The &quot;Enterprise&quot; departed on her 14th overseas
deployment on September 17, 1989, under command of Captain Harry
T. Rittenour. Upon completion of that assignment, she had
accomplished her sixth around the world cruise. After another
major overhaul, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to service,
with Norfolk, Virginia as her homeport. She sailed into the 21st
Century and was finally retired to the Navy Museum at Peal Harbor
in 2005. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Confederate States had a very
small navy at the beginning of the Civil War, and was forced to
acquire ships from many different sources. These ships were of a
wide variety of sizes and types. The &quot;CSS Enterprise&quot;
was acquired in 1865. She was a 250-foot iron-hulled cruiser
powered by a combination of steam and sail. She only served with
the Confederate Navy for about one year, and was sold to Brazil
(as the &quot;Brasil&quot;) in 1866. She continued to service
with that country as a transport, until she was retired in 1877. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1976 to
1986 - Space Shuttle OV-101 </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first space-related
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was the prototype of the American space
shuttle, the world's first reusable spacecraft. Although she was
never intended for actual flight into space, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; conducted a series of unpowered approach
and landing tests during 1977. During these tests, she was
carried aloft atop a specially-modified Boeing 747 and released
to glide to unpowered, but piloted landings at Edwards Air Force
Base, California. These tests proved the aerodynamic stability of
the space shuttle design and the ability of the astronaut crew to
guide the space shuttle to a safe landing. In later years, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; continued to be used as a test bed for the
flight-worthy space shuttle fleet. The space shuttle
&quot;Enterprise&quot; now resides at the Dulles Airport Annex of
the National Air and Space Museum. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE&quot; - 2003 to

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The second space
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was the first member of an operational
fleet of aerospace planes that could take off from conventional
runways, fly into space, and then return to a runway landing. She
was commissioned in 2003. The role of the aerospace plane fleet
was to provide routine access to space. The
&quot;Enterprise&quot; and the other aerospace planes made
regular flights to the international space station
&quot;Freedom&quot;, ferrying scientists, supplies, and mid-sized
cargo into Earth orbit. As available space permitted, the
aerospace planes also provided passenger service, and were able
to travel from one point on the Earth to any other point within
two hours of flight time. Some members of the aerospace plane
fleet continued to fly well into the 22nd century. However, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was retired in 2055, after 52 years of
continuous service. She helped to open up access to space to the
general public and make spaceflight as routine and safe as
commercial aviation was during the late 20th century. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE&quot; - 2123 to
2165 - Spaceliner </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Because the United Nations Solar
Fleet did not use the name &quot;Enterprise&quot; for any of its
space ships, almost 70 years passed between time the second and
third space-going &quot;Enterprises&quot; were commissioned. This
vessel was the second space-going &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the
first spaceliner built specifically for the major Federation
space lanes (such as Earth to Alpha Centauri). She had a warp
drive engine and could attain a speed of warp 3.2. The travel
demands that blossomed in the mid-22nd Century resulted in 957
Declaration-class spaceliners being built by the Federation's
Trade Bureau. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; was the most popular of
these. In addition to her warp drive technology, she was the
first space vessel to be equipped with sub-space radio. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;USS ENTERPRISE&quot; - 2188
to 2222 - Starship NCC-1701 </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first starship
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was the most famous vessel in the history
of Starfleet. She served gallantly for a total of 39 years. She
was commanded on a series of patrol and exploratory missions by
Captains Robert April, Christopher Pike, and James Kirk. Under
the command of Captain Kirk, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and her
crew became living legends, not only among member planets of the
Federation, but among the Klingon and Romulan Empires as well. In
2183, five years before she was officially commissioned, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was pressed into service on a secret
mission commanded by Captain April. Among her crew on this secret
mission was George Kirk, father of Captain James Kirk. It was
George Kirk who recommended that the (then unnamed) starship be
called the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, noting the proud history of
prior vessels of that name. After she was commissioned in 2188,
the &quot;Enterprise&quot; began the first of her patrol
missions. During her second patrol, under Captain Pike, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; encountered the highly telepathic race on
Talos IV in 2196. As a result of the crew's experiences, Talos IV
was placed on permanent quarantine. In 2202, Captain Kirk assumed
command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. During this early mission,
Captain Kirk and other bridge crew members were involved in a
time-travel episode in which they intervened on behalf of
survivors of a Vulcan scout ship which crashed on Earth in 2045.
Although never officially acknowledged by the Federation, this
was the first contact by humans with extraterrestrials. In 2207,
Captain Kirk led the &quot;Enterprise&quot; on the first of her
5-year exploratory missions. The exploits of the ship and her
crew during the next 15 years have become legendary and have been
recreated in numerous media, including holovision, videobooks,
and even old-style paper books. Among her exploits were the
discovery of the Guardian of Forever, several time travel voyages
to Earth's past, and numerous missions where she brought
stability to planetary cultures that underwent some type of
unnatural change. Because of rapidly developing starship
technology, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was upgraded several times
during her career. These included (1) a minor upgrade in 2201,
before she was placed under the command of Captain Kirk; (2) in
2206, at which time she was upgraded to Bon Homme Richard-class
before the start of her 5-year exploratory mission under Captain
Kirk; and (3) in 2210, when she was upgraded to Achernar-class.
In 2212, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; entered Earth-orbital dry
dock for major refit. When she emerged 2 1/2 years later, she was
virtually a new ship. The refit had included streamlining her
hull, reconfiguring her internal deck arrangement, and replacing
her warp drive engines and armament. During time period of her
refit, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was under the command of
Captain Will Decker. In 2215, the revised &quot;Enterprise&quot;
was rushed out of dry dock under command of now- Admiral Kirk to
confront the V'ger probe. Captain Decker and Lt. Ilia, the ship's
Deltan navigator, were listed as &quot;missing in action&quot; as
a result of that confrontation. After completing another 5-year
mission, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was assigned as the Starfleet
Academy Training Vessel, under command of Captain Spock. In late
2222, while on a training cruise, she was heavily damaged by
&quot;Reliant&quot;, which had been commandeered by Khan Noonian
Singh. Captain Spock was killed during this encounter. The
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was subsequently stolen from space dock by
Admiral Kirk and his bridge crew in an attempt to recover Captain
Spock's body from the Genesis Planet. During this attempt, Kirk
ordered the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to self-destruct in order to
keep her from capture by the Klingons. Spock's body was recovered
and successfully re-fused with his katra. In honor of the gallant
starship, a tradition was started of naming all Starfleet
flagships &quot;Enterprise&quot; and assigning the registration
number &quot;NCC-1701&quot; followed by a letter to identify each
succeeding ship. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;USS ENTERPRISE&quot; - 2222
to 2242 - Starship NCC-1701A </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After the destruction of
&quot;Enterprise&quot; NCC-1701, Starfleet decided to rechristen
the &quot;Ti-Ho&quot; as &quot;Enterprise&quot; NCC-1701A.
&quot;Ti-Ho&quot; was a later model of the Enterprise-class
cruiser and was equipped with more advanced computers, control
consoles, and the latest in transwarp drive technology.
Externally, the new &quot;Enterprise&quot; was identical to her
famous predecessor. After the original starship
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was destroyed at the Genesis Planet,
Admiral Kirk and his rebel crew commandeered a Klingon Bird of
Prey and took temporary refuge on Vulcan. While enroute back to
Earth to face charges for stealing the &quot;Enterprise&quot;,
the Whalesong Incident occurred. During this incident, Admiral
Kirk and crew used the Klingon Bird of Prey to time travel to
Earth in 1986. This was necessary in order to retrieve two
humpback whales and return them to 2222. This extinct species was
the only one that could communicate with an alien probe
vaporizing Earth's oceans. With the help of the 20th Century
aircraft carrier CVN-65 &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the mission was
successful. Upon returning to Earth, Admiral Kirk and crew faced
trial. All charges were dropped, except one against Kirk for
failure to obey a direct order. Kirk was demoted to the rank of
Captain and placed in command of the new starship
&quot;Enterprise&quot; NCC-1701A. After a shakedown cruise, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; entered spacedock for repair of systems
which malfunctioned during the shakedown. Before those repairs
could be completed, however, she was ordered to the planet Nimbus
III in the Neutral Zone to rescue diplomats supposedly being held
hostage by the renegade Vulcan Sybok. Through trickery, Sybok and
his followers managed to hijack the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and
send it on a mission to search for God at the center of the
Galaxy. The starship penetrated an energy barrier surrounding the
Galactic Core. However, what they found was not God, but a
malevolent energy being. After the crew had a well- deserved
shore leave on Earth, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; began a new
exploratory mission, which ended tragically in 2232, when Captain
Kirk was killed in action. Lt. Commander Hikaru Sulu was made
Captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and commanded her on until
she was retired to the Starfleet Museum at Memory Alpha in 2242. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;USS ENTERPRISE&quot; - 2308
to 2328 - Starship NCC-1701B </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After the death of Captain James
Kirk, Starfleet decided to name its next flagship the &quot;James
T. Kirk&quot; in his honor. Therefore, a span of 66 years passed
between the fifth and sixth space-going &quot;Enterprises&quot;.
This &quot;Enterprise&quot; was of the Excelsior-class. After she
was commissioned in 2308, she was assigned to patrol the Romulan
Neutral Zone, where she was stationed for many years. Starfleet
has not yet declassified the service history of the
&quot;Enterprise&quot;. Therefore, her ultimate fate is unknown.
However, according to one unofficial source, she served at least
two 5-year exploratory cruises, during which she made many first
contacts with previously unknown races. When the Great War broke
out between the Federation and the Klingon Empire, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was called to active duty in her role as
Starfleet flagship. She engaged the Klingon cruiser
&quot;Battlequeen II&quot; at the Battle of Rigel. This was one
of the most important battles of the War, and the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; emerged victorious. Appropriately, after
the war ended, it was the &quot;Enterprise&quot; which ferried
the Federation and Klingon delegations to Babel, where the peace
accords were signed. The unofficial source continues that the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; then returned to her patrol duties in the
Romulan Neutral Zone, where she was attacked by a renegade
Klingon L-24 battleship and a Romulan Nova-class battleship.
Although the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was successful in destroying
her attackers, she was also lost in the battle. Until Starfleet
declassifies her service record, however, the true story of the
starship NCC-1701B will be shrouded in mystery. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;USS ENTERPRISE&quot; - 2337
to 2344 - Starship NCC-1701C </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next starship
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was originally scheduled for construction
in 2329 as an Alaska-class battleship. However, these plans were
scrapped and the starship NCC-1701C was commissioned in 2337 as
an Ambassador-class cruiser. The completed a 5-year patrol
mission in the Neutral Zone and in 2342 began what was to have
been a 10-year exploratory mission at the Galaxy's Great Outer
rim. However, in 2344 she disappeared without a trace. The story
of what happened to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; remained a mystery
until 2366, when a freak time vortex transported her 22 years
into the future and an encounter with her successor, the starship
NCC-1701D. It was learned that in 2344, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; NCC-1701C, under command of Captain Rachel
Garrett, received a distress call from the Klingon outpost at
Norenda III. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; answered the call and was
attacked by four Romulan War Birds. The &quot;Enterprise&quot;
was destroyed in the attack, as was the Klingon outpost.
Eventually, the officers of the starships NCC-1701C and NCC-
1701D realized that the NCC-1701C had to return through the tie
vortex to her own destiny in the year 2344. Only that act of
sacrifice would return the historical timeline of 2366 to the
correct one. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;USS ENTERPRISE&quot; - 2364
to Date - Starship NCC-1701D </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The latest &quot;Enterprise&quot;
is the fifth Starfleet vessel to carry the proud name and
registration number &quot;NCC-1701&quot;. It is twice the length
of the original starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; and has eight
times the interior space. However, she retains much of the same
symmetry of an engineering section with its twin nacelles and a
large saucer-shaped command section. On a typical 15-year
mission, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; carries 1,200 persons,
including crew and their families. Under the command of Captain
Jean- Luc Picard, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; continues to expand
the frontiers of knowledge about our Galaxy and the strange
beings that inhabit it. As always, she is also ready to defend
herself and the Federation, if called upon. Although still many
years from completion of her first 15- year mission, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; and her crew have achieved an enviable
record of achievements. Among her exploits, the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; made the first official contact with the
Ferengi Alliance, was the first to encounter the entity
&quot;Q&quot;, was instrumental in quelching the conspiracy known
as the Starfleet Code One Emergency, and re-established contact
with the Romulans. In 2367, the crew of the
&quot;Enterprise&quot; heroically battled the dreaded Borg, and
saved the planet Earth and the entire Federation from certain
destruction. </font></p>

ENTERPRISES *****</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There have been many
privately-owned &quot;Enterprises&quot; throughout history: too
many to include in this history. However, my research did uncover
several which played important roles in the early history of
maritime commerce. Here is a partial list of those private
&quot;Enterprises&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1814 -
Stern-Wheel Steamboat </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Built by Mississippi steamboat
pioneer Henry Miller Shreve, this &quot;Enterprise&quot; was the
first steamboat to ascend the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers from
New Orleans to Louisville. She also carried supplies to Andrew
Jackson's army during the Battle of New Orleans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1816 -
Steam Tow Boat </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This &quot;Enterprise&quot; was
one of the first steamboats to be used to tow cargo barges. She
sailed regularly between Savannah and Augusta, Georgia. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1818 -
Steam Tow Boat </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This was New England's first steam
tow boat. She operated from Hartford, Connecticut. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1825 -
Schooner </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This sail-powered
&quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed between Boston, Massachusetts and
Albany, New York. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRIZE&quot; - 1826 -
Side-Wheel Paddle Steamship </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In response to a reward of 80,000
rupees offered to the first ship to provide steam-powered service
between Europe and India, a group of British businessmen
purchased the 133-foot &quot;Enterprize&quot; in 1825. Their
journey from Falmouth, England to Calcutta, India was not,
however, fast enough to earn the reward. However, the Government
of India purchased the &quot;Enterprize&quot; from the
businessmen and used the ship as a troop carrier from 1826 to
1830. After this tour of official duty, the East India Company
acquired the &quot;Enterprize&quot; and returned her to
commercial duties. In 1840, she became the first ship to provide
regular mail service through the port of Suez to India. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE&quot; 1847 -
Steamship </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This steam-powered ship sailed
regularly between New York and Liverpool, England until 1860. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1848 -
Schooner </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This was another sail-powered
schooner. She sailed between New York and Boston. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE - 1850 -
Side-Wheel Steamboat </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This paddle wheeler was active on
a run between San Francisco and Sacramento. When her owner took
her to Puget Sound, she met stiff price competition from another
steamboat owned by the Wright Brothers. She was eventually sold
to the Wright Brothers, who removed her engine and installed it
in their vessel. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE - 1855 - Steam Tug
</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This British
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was commissioned in 1855 and served at
least through August 1874. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;SS ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1901 -
Steamship </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This &quot;Enterprise&quot; was
the first steamship owned by the Matson Line, a Pacific pioneer.
In 1901, she began regular service between California and Hawaii.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1930 -
America's Cup Yacht </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In 1930, the J-class yacht
&quot;Enterprise&quot; successfully defended the America's Cup
against the British challenger &quot;Shamrock V.&quot; The
&quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed to victory in four straight races
between September 13 and 18, 1930. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1977 -
America's Cup Yacht </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The 12-meter yacht
&quot;Enterprise&quot; was one of the American yachts which
competed in preliminary elimination races to the select the one
which would defend the America's Cup in 1977. Unfortunately, she
lost to Ted Turner's &quot;Courageous.&quot; However,
&quot;Courageous&quot; did go on to defeat the challenger
&quot;Australia.&quot; In 1980, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was
used as the training and trials boat for the defender
&quot;Freedom,&quot; which also went on to defeat the
&quot;Australia.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&quot;ENTERPRISE&quot; - 1980 -
Airship </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Company operated a fleet of helium-filled airships (commonly
known as &quot;blimps&quot;). One of these airships was called
the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. She and her sister ships routinely
appeared at sporting events, providing excellent overhead vantage
points for television cameras. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; was
stationed at Pompano beach, Florida. She was retired in 1990 and
replaced by the &quot;Spirit of Akron.&quot; </font></p>

<h2 align="center"><font face="Arial">***** CONCLUSION *****</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">First, a note about the dates I've
used here for the starships &quot;Enterprise&quot;. There has
been some controversy about the timelines and dates of service of
the starships &quot;Enterprise.&quot; This developed because
certain statements in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next
Generation&quot; Writer's Guide and some of the series' episodes
result in a 64-year discrepancy in the timelines. Some fans have
shifted the dates for events before &quot;Star Trek: The Next
Generation&quot; by 64 years to accommodate this discrepancy. I
have not done this. I believe that the dates used in
&quot;official&quot; publications licensed by Paramount Pictures
(such as the &quot;Starfleet Spaceflight Chronology&quot; and
&quot;Mr. Scott's Guide to the Enterprise&quot;) should be
accepted as fact and not arbitrarily shifted forward 64 years. To
explain the 64-year gap, I've tried to reconcile at least six
different Star Trek chronologies and come up with my own
variation, which I call &quot;The Unified Spaceflight
Chronology&quot;. I uploaded my &quot;Unified Spaceflight
Chronology&quot; to this data library in January 1990. Look for
files: TIMELN.TXT (explanatory notes as to how I constructed the
chronology) and TIMELN.LST (the chronology itself). </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I've put together a 78-page, laser
printed, fully illustrated, and bound manuscript which expands on
the ship histories contained in this file. The manuscript
contains complete specifications and a profile line drawing for
each ship, along with an &quot;Enterprise&quot; comparison chart
showing the different ships in scale, a graphic
&quot;Enterprise&quot; timeline, and a 3-page reference
bibliography. If you would like to obtain a copy of that
manuscript, you can send $10 (to help defray my research and
printing costs) to the following address: </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Although I have copyrighted my

My CompuServe ID is 71777,2365. I will continue to search for
information on other &quot;Enterprise&quot; (particularly any
which may have served with the navies of other countries). If I'm
successful, I'll upload future revisions to this history. </font></p>
