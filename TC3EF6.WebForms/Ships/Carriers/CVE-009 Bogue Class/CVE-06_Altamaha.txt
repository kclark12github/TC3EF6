AVG-6 was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 160) 
on 15 April 1941 at Pascagoula, Miss., by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp.; 
named ALTAMAHA on 7 January 1942 but the name was canceled on 17 March 
1942; launched on 4 April 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Phillip Seymour, wife of 
Capt. Seymour; redesignated ACV on 20 August 1942, acquired by the Navy 
on 31 October 1942 and simultaneously transferred to the United Kingdom. 
That same day, the ship was renamed HMS BATTLER and commissioned by the 
Royal Navy.
BATTLER served the Royal Navy throughout World War II, operating for the 
most part on convoy escort and antisubmarine warfare missions in the North 
Atlantic. In September 1943, she supported the invasion of Italy at Salerno. 
The ship was redesignated CVE-6 by the American Navy on 15 July 1943. She 
was returned to the custody of the United States on 12 February 1946. She 
was struck from the Navy list on 28 March 1946. She was sold on 14 May 
1946 to the Patapsco Steel Scrap Co., Bethlehem, Pa., and was subsequently 
scrapped.
