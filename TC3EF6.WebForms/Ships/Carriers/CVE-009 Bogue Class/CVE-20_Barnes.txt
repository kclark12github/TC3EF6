Laid down under a Maritime Commission contract, the second BARNES (ACV-
20) was transferred to the Navy 1 May 1942; launched 22 May 1942 by 
Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp., Tacoma, Wash.; sponsored by Mrs. G. L. 
Hutchinson, widow of Lieutenant Hutchinson; and commissioned 20 February 
1943, Captain C. D. Glover in command.  Originally classified AVG-20, she 
was reclassified ACV-20, 20 August 1942; CVE-20, 15 July 1943; and 
CVHE-20, 12 June 1955.
The major task of BARNES throughout World War II was the transporting of 
aircraft and personnel from the United States to forward areas of the 
Pacific.  In addition she served as a combat, training and pilot qualifying 
carrier.
While performing these duties she launched her planes on several raids 
against Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands operation (20 November-5 December 
1943); and provided invaluable aircraft replenishment to the various task 
groups of the 3rd Fleet during the western Caroline Islands operation (6 
September-14 October 1944), and the Luzon attacks (19 October 1944).
After Japan’s surrender, BARNES remained in the Far East on occupation 
duty until 3 November 1945.  Returning to the United States in March 1946 
BARNES remained on the west coast for a period of time and then steamed to 
Boston, where she was placed out of commission in reserve 29 August 1946.
BARNES was awarded three battle stars for her service during World War II.
