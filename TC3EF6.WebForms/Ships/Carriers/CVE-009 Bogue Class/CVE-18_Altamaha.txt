ALTAMAHA (CVE-18) was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract 
(MC hull 235) on 19 December 1941 at Tacoma, Wash., by the Seattle-
Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp.; launched on 25 May 1942; sponsored by Mrs. 
Thomas S. Combs, the wife of Comdr. Combs who was the commanding 
officer of seaplane tender CASCO (AVP-12), and commissioned on 15 
September 1942 Capt. J. R. Tate in command.
Followin brief sea trials, ALTAMAHA got underway for San Diego, Calif., on 
27 October in company with KENDRICK (DD-612). While they were en route, 
KENDRICK spotted a submarine and claimed that members of her crew had 
seen three torpedoes which had been fired at the escort carrier. However, no 
one on ALTAMAHA observed any of the torpedoes. The voyaGe continued 
uneventfully, and the ships reached San Diego on the 31st. The carrier then 
took on aircraft and passeners and sailed in convoy on 3 November for the 
southwest Pacific.
Upon reaching Espiritu Santo on 24 November, she delivered part of her 
cargo and continued on to New Caledonia. She reached Noumea on 28 
November and commenced a period of flight operations and training 
exercises. The vessel returned to Espiritu Santo on 30 December, but 
continued on to the Fiji Islands and touched at Nandi on 13 January 1943 
before beginning another period of opertional training.
In early February, ALTAMAHA paused off Funafuti, Ellice Islands; loaded 
cargo and personnel on to barges and sent them ashore. The carrier then 
proceeded to Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 10 February. There, the 
planes and personnel of Air Group 11 came on board, and the ship set a 
course for the Fiji Islands on the l9th. She reached Nandi on 28 February, 
discharged her cargo, and reversed her course back toward the Hawaiian 
Islands.
After a short stay in port at Pearl Harbor, the escort carrier got underway 
on 9 March with replacement aircraft for the flattops of the Pacific Fleet. 
She paused at Palmyra Island on 15 March, continued on to Johnston Island 
debarked marine aviation personnel on the 17th; and touched at Midway 
three days later before reversing course and returning to Hawaii. She 
remained at Pearl Harbor for one day, 23 March, and then continued on to the 
west coast.
ALTAMAHA reached San Diego on 1 April and commenced three and one-half 
months of flight operations off the California coast alternated with upkeep 
in San Diego. On 13 July, she arrived at Alameda, Calif., to take on planes 
from the naval air station there. The escort carrier got underway for 
Australia three days later and made Brisbane on 3 August. Following a 10-
day visit to Fremantle, she got underway on the 16th for India and arrived at 
Karachi on 28 August and delivered 29 Army Air Force airplanes.
On 2 September, the escort carrier reversed her course and steamed back to 
Australia. She reached Melbourne on the 18th and, at the end of three days 
there in a leave and upkeep status got underway for the west coast of the 
United States. On 8 October, the vessel entered the Mare Island Navy Yard, 
Vallejo Calif., for overhaul.
The escort carrier got underway for sea trials on 8 November paused briefly 
at Alameda to take on replacement aircraft, and sailed on the 13th for 
Brisbane. ALTAMAHA reached her destination on 30 November and began 
discharging her cargo. The ship left there on 4 December to return home. 
Upon her arrival at San Diego on the 21st, she began a period of 
local operations carrier qualifications, and repairs.
The ship got underway for Pearl Harbor on 22 March 1944 arrived there on 
the 28th, and began taking on Composite Squadron 6 for transportation to an 
operating area 300 miles east of the Marshall Islands. The carrier had been 
selected to be the nucleus of Task Group (TG) 11.1-which was established 
for a hunter/killer operation to destroy Japanese submarines operating 
against the Pearl Harbor-Marshall Islands supply lines-and left Hawaii in 
company with four destroyer escorts on 30 March. The warships reached 
their assigned area on 3 April and began their first patrol. The group 
reported contacting two submarines but did not receive credit for damaging 
or destroying either. The task group put into Majuro Atoll on 8 April to allow 
the destroyer escorts to refuel.
The ships sailed on the 11th to carry out a second antisubmarine mission. 
ALTAMAHA was the target of a torpedo attack on the 15th but successfully 
evaded all four shots. The remainder of the patrol passed uneventfully 
before TG 11.1 was relieved on 18 April and shaped a course for Pearl 
Harbor. Following a short upkeep period in Hawaiian waters, the carrier 
returned to Majuro in early May and operated in an antisubmarine screen off 
the Marshall Islands for several days before returning to Pearl Harbor on 11 
May.
After a two-day layover in Hawaii, ALTAMAHA pushed on toward the west 
coast. Reaching Alameda on the 18th, she entered the shipyard of the United 
Engineering Co. for repairs and alterations. She resumed operations on the 
last day in May and headed for Hawaii, laden with aircraft and spare parts.
Having delivered her cargo at Pearl Harbor, ALTAMAHA returned to Alameda. 
From there, she proceeded to San Diego which she reached on 19 June and 
spent two days loading men and equipment before departing California on 
the 21st, bound for the New Hebrides. She reached Espiritu Santo on 7 July-
discharged cargo-and, on the 12th, headed for Morobe, New Guinea, where 
she arrived on 16 July. Having made additional calls at Langemak, New 
Guinea, and Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island, ALTAMAHA arrived back at 
Espiritu Santo on the 25th. She made one more cruise from this island, 
during which she visited Seeadler Harbor and Guadalcanal. The carrier 
departed the New Hebrides on 10 August bound for Hawaii.
ALTAMAHA paused at Pearl Harbor for two days and then sailed on to San 
Diego. She spent four days there before getting underway and setting course 
for Pearl Harbor. She departed Hawaiian waters on 8 September, made port 
calls at Emirau Island and Seeadler Harbor, and returned to San Diego, where 
she arrived on 6 October. The vessel next spent three weeks in local 
operations before getting underway on the 26th for another voyage west.
The escort carrier paused at Pearl Harbor for three days, then sailed for 
Eniwetok with replacement aircraft and pilots. On 15 November, she reached 
Ulithi and then carried out flight operations off Ulithi through 14 December, 
when she got underway for the 3d Fleet replenishment area. On the 16th, the 
ship joined TG 30.8-which was composed of oilers and replacement 
carriers-in the Philippine Sea and, the next day, began transferring pilots to 
BUCHANAN (DD-484). However, heavy seas compelled her to break off that 
task. By early morning on the 18th, the disturbance had grown into a raging 
typhoon. By 0900, the escort carrier was laboring heavily and rolling as 
much as 25 to 30 degrees to either side. An hour later, visibility dropped to 
zero, and the vessel abandoned all effort to keep station. Almost one-half of 
the aircraft on board ALTAMAHA broke loose and plunged overboard. The ship 
also experienced problems with flooding in the forward elevator pit. By 
1600, the weather was improving and the ship rode better. Soon she made a 
rendezvous with other members of TG 30.8.
While the carrier sustained considerable material damage, she suffered no 
personnel casualties and was able to resume her resupply operations on 19 
December. ALTAMAHA continued her operations with the replenishment 
group through early February 1945. During this time, she serviced 3d Fleet 
units in Philippine waters and made port calls at Guam Manus, and Ulithi. On 
15 February, the ship touched at Pearl Harbor.
ALTAMAHA continued on to the west coast, arriving at Alameda on 26 
February. The ship began an availability at the Hunters Point Navy Yard on 3 
March during which she was dry-docked for routine work below the 
waterline and repairs to a propeller damaged in the typhoon. The carrier 
emerged from the yard on 14 March and began loading planes, ammunition, 
and supplies for transportation to Pearl Harbor.
During the remaining months of World War II, ALTAMAHA provided general 
transportation service from Alameda, San Diego, and Pearl Harbor to various 
points in the Pacific. Among her stops were Guam, Saipan, Eniwetok, Kossol 
Roads, and Samar. Following the Japanese capitulation in mid-August 
ALTAMAHA returned to the west coast for repairs and an overhaul at the 
Hunters Point Navy Yard. She began sea trials in midOctober and got 
underway for Pearl Harbor on the 22d. The vessel was then assigned to the 
"Magic-Carpet" fleet and transported armed forces personnel and equipment 
throughout the Pacific back to the United States.
On 15 January 1946, ALTAMAHA headed to Tacoma, Wash. Deactivation 
preparations were begun there, and the carrier was placed out of 
commission, in reserve, on 27 September 1946. The ship was redesignated 
CVHE-18 on 12 June 1955. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 
March 1959, and the vessel was sold on 25 April 1961 to Eisenberg & Co., 
New York City, N. Y., and, later that year, was scrapped in Japan. ALTAMAHA 
won one battle star for her World War II service.
