BRETON was launched 27 June 1942 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp., 
Tacoma, Wash., under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. A. 
H. Rooks, widow of Captain Rooks; and commissioned 12 April 1943, Captain

Throughout her World War II service BRETON operated with the Carrier 
Transport Squadron, Pacific Fleet.  Her sailings carried her throughout the 
Pacific supplying men, materiel, and aircraft to units of the fleet engaged in 
making strikes on the enemy.  While engaged in these duties BRETON took 
part in the capture and occupation of Saipan (11 June-10 August 1944); the 
Battle of the Philippine Sea (19-20 June);  the 2nd Bonins raid (24 June); 
and the assault and occupation of Okinawa (6-7 April 1945).
Upon her return to the west coast in January 1946, after serving as a unit of 
the Far Eastern occupation forces, BRETON prepared for inactivation at 
Tacoma, Wash., and went out of commission in reserve there 30 August 
1946.  She was reclassified CVHE-23 on 12 June 1955. BRETON received four 
battle stars for her World War II service.
