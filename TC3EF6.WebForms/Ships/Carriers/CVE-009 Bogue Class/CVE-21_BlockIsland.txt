The first BLOCK ISLAND (ACV-21) was launched 6 June 1942 by Seattle-
Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp., Seattle, Wash., under a Maritime Commission 
contract; sponsored by Mrs. H. B. Hutchinson, wife of Commander Hutchinson; 
transferred to the Navy 1 May 1942; and commissioned 8 march 1943, 
Captain L. C. Ramsey in command.  Originally classified AVG-21, she became 
ACV-21, 20 August 1942, and CVE-21, 15 July 1943.
Departing San Diego in May 1943 BLOCK ISLAND steamed to Norfolk, Va., to 
join the Atlantic Fleet.  After two trips from New York to Belfast, Ireland, 
during the summer of 1943 with cargoes of Army fighters, she operated as 
part of a hunter-killer team.  During her four antisubmarine cruises BLOCK 
ISLAND's planes sank two submarines: U-220 in 487-53 N., 33-30 W., 28 
October 1943 and U-1059 in 13-10 N., 33-44 W., 19 March 1944.  She shared 
the credit with CORRY (DD-453) and BRONSTEIN (DE-189) for the sinking of 
U-801 in 16-42 N., 30-20 W., 17 March 1944 and with BUCKLEY (DE-51) for 
U-66 sunk 6 May 1944 in 17-17 N., 32-29 W. Three of BLOCK ISLANDS 
escorts, THOMAS (DE-102), BOSTWICK (DE-103), and BRONSTEIN sank U-709 
on 1 March 1943 and the same day BRONSTEIN got U603.
At 2013, 28 May 1944, BLOCK ISLAND was torpedoed by U-549 which had 
slipped undetected through her screen.  The German submarine put one and 
perhaps two more torpedoes into the stricken carrier before being sunk 
herself by the avenging EUGENE E. ELMORE (DE-686) and AHRENS (DE-575) of 
the screen in 31-13 N., 23-03 W.
BLOCK ISLAND (CVE-21) received two battle stars for her service.
