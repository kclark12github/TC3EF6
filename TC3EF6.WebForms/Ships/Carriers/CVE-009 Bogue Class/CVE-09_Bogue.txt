BOGUE was originally classified AVG-9, but was changed to ACV-9, 20 
August 1942; CVE-9, 15 July 1943; and CVHE-9, 12 June 1955.  She was 
launched 15 January 1942 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Co., Tacoma, 
Wash., under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. W. Miller, 
Jr., wife of Lieutenant Commander Miller; transferred to the Navy 1 May 
1942; and commissioned 26 September 1942, Captain G. E. Short in 
command.
After an extensive shakedown and repair period BOGUE joined the Atlantic 
Fleet in February 1943 as the nucleus of the pioneer American anti-
submarine hunter-killer group.  During March and April 1943 she made three 
North Atlantic crossings but sank no submarines.  She departed on her fourth 
crossing 22 April and got her first submarine 22 May when her aircraft sank 
U-569 in 50-40 N., 35-21 W.  During her fifth North Atlantic cruise her 
planes sank two German submarines: U-217 in 30-18 N., 42-50 W., 5 June 
and U-118 in 30-49 N., 33-49 W., 12 June.  On 23 July 1943, during her 
seventh patrol, her planes sank U-527 in 35-25 N., 27-56 W.  GEORGE E. 
BADGER (DD-196), of her screen, sank U-613 during this patrol.
BOGUE's eighth patrol was her most productive with three German 
submarines sunk: U-86 by planes, 29 November 1943 in 39-33 N., 19-01 W.; 
U-172 by planes, GEORGE E. BADGER, DUPONT (DD-152), CLEMSON (DD-186), 
and OSMOND INGRAM (DD-255), 13 December in 26-19 N., 29-58 W.; and U-
850 by planes, 20 December in 32-54 N., 37-01 W.
BOGUE had a break from her anti-submarine operations during January and 
February 1944 when she carried a cargo of Army fighters to Glasgow, 
Scotland.  The carrier then returned to her anti-submarine role and on 13 
March her aircraft teamed with British planes, HAVERFIELD (DE-393), 
HOBSON (DD-464), and HMCS PRINCE RUPERT to sink U-575 in 46-18 N., 27-
34 W.
On 5 May 1944 BOGUE and her escorts departed Hampton Roads, Va., for a 
cruise that netted two more submarines and lasted until 2 July.  FRANCIS M. 
ROBINSON (DE-220), of the screen, sank the Japanese RO-501 (ex-German U-
1224) on 13 May and BOGUE's planes sank the Japanese I-52 in 15-16 N., 39-
55 W., on 24 June.  During the next cruise, 24 July-24 September 1944, 
BOGUE's planes sank another German submarine, U-1229, 20 August in 42-20 
N., 51-39 W.
Following her return in September 1944 BOGUE operated on training 
missions out of Bermuda and Quonset Point, R. I., until February 1945 when 
she made a trip to Liverpool, England, with Army planes.  In April 1945 she 
put to sea again as an anti-submarine vessel, forming part of Captain G. J. 
Dufek's Second Barrier Force.  On 24 April success came to FLAHERTY (DE-
135), NEUNZER (DE-150), CHATELAIN (DE-149), VARIAN (DE798), HUBBARD 
(DE-211), JANSSEN (DE-396), PILLSBURY (DE-133), and KEITH (DE-241) sank 
U-546.  This was the last of 13 submarines sunk by BOGUE or her escorts.
With the war in the Atlantic over, BOGUE moved to the Pacific, arriving at 
San Diego 3 July 1945.  She then steamed westward to Guam, arriving 24 
July.  She made a trip to Adak, Alaska, (19 August-6 September 1945), and 
then joined the "Magic-Carpet" fleet returning servicemen from the Pacific 
islands.  She was placed out of commission in reserve 30 November 1946 at 
Tacoma, Wash.
BOGUE received a Presidential Unit Citation and three battle stars for her 
World War II service.
