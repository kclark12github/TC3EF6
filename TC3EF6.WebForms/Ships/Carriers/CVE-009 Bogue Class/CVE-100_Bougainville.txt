BOUGAINVILLE (CVE-100) was launched 16 May 1944 by Kaiser Co., Inc., 
Vancouver, Wash., under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. 
Sally A. Montfort, wife of Captain Montfort; acquired 18 June 1944; and 
commissioned the same day, Captain C. A. Bond in command.
On 25 July 1944 BOUGAINVILLE departed San Diego and steamed to Pearl 
Harbor where on 1 August she reported to Commander, Carrier Transport 
Squadron, Pacific Fleet.  During the remainder of 1944 she transported 
aircraft to the Marshall, Admiralty and Marianas Islands.  Returning to San 
Diego 22 December, she underwent a brief period of availability until 7 
January 1945.
On 8 February 1945 BOUGAINVILLE reported to Commander, Service Squadron 
6, at Eniwetok and for the next six months provided underway replenishment 
throughout the Western Pacific to the various Task Groups of TF's 58 and 38.  
She rendezvoused with these groups at sea and delivered planes, 
replacement pilots, and aircraft crews to the large fleet carriers.  During 
February and March 1945 she carried out replenishment operations with TG 
50.8 during the Iwo Jima operation.  Until June she provided vital logistic 
support to the units of the 5th and 3rd Fleets engaged in raids in support of 
the Okinawa operation.
In August, after a brief period of availability at San Diego, BOUGAINVILLE 
returned to Pearl Harbor.  During the remainder of the month she transported 
aircraft between Pearl Harbor and the Marshall and Marianas Islands.
In September she steamed to Okinawa where she remained until getting 
underway 6 October 1945 to deliver planes and occupation personnel to 
several Chinese ports.  Returning to Okinawa on the 19th, she departed the 
following day for San Diego.  At San Diego she underwent a brief yard period 
until 28 November and then made her final voyage to Pearl Harbor and 
Eniwetok.  She returned to San Diego 12 January 1946 and reported to the 
19th Fleet for inactivation.  She sailed from San Diego 19 January enroute 
to Port Angeles, Wash., and then to Tacoma. BOUGAINVILLE was placed out of 
commission in reserve there 3 November 1946.  She was reclassified CVU-
100 on 16 June 1955.
BOUGAINVILLE received two battle stars for her World War II service.
