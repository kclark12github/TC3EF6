BUFFALO (CL-99) was reclassified CV-29 and renamed BATAAN 2 June 1942; 
reclassified CVL-29, 15 July 1943; launched 1 August 1943 by New York 
Shipbuilding Corp., Camden, N.J.; sponsored by Mrs. George D. Murray, wife of 
Rear Admiral Murray; commissioned 17 November 1943, Captain V. H. 
Schaeffer in command; and reported to the Pacific Fleet.
In her initial engagement with the Japanese, BATAAN's planes supported the 
attack on Hollandia, New Guinea, between 21 and 24 April 1944.  Following 
this action were strikes against Truk, Satawan, and Ponape (29 April-1 May 
1944); Saipan, Marianas (11 June-10 August); 1st Bonins raid (15-16 June); 
Battle of Philippine Sea (19-20 June); and the 2nd Bonins raid (24 June).
BATAAN then returned to the United States for repairs.  Repairs completed 
she joined TF 58 and participated in the fleet raids in support of the 
Okinawa operation (17 March-30 May 1945), during which her aircraft 
assisted in the sinking of the Japanese submarine I-56, 18 April 1945, in 
26-42 N., 130-38 E.  Retiring to the Philippines, BATAAN joined the 3rd 
Fleet for operations against the Japanese home islands (10 July-15 August).
BATAAN returned to the United States, arriving at New York 17 October 
1945, and was assigned to Magic Carpet" to prepare for inactivation.  
BATAAN went out of commission in reserve 11 February 1947.
BATAAN was recommissioned 13 May 1950 at Philadelphia.  In July 1950 she 
stood out for San Diego, upon arrival loaded Air Force cargo and personnel, 
and departed 16 November for Tokyo Bay.  She arrived in Korean waters 15 
December and until June 1951 her aircraft flew strikes in support of the 
ground forces.
BATAAN departed for the west coast 2 June 1951 and after a brief stop at 
San Diego steamed to Bremerton Wash., 9 July for overhaul.  She returned to 
San Diego 20 November and on 27 January 1952 departed for Yokosuka, 
Japan, and thence to Buckner Bay, Okinawa.  She conducted air exercises and 
other training maneuvers off Okinawa until 29 April when she sailed for 
Korean waters.  BATAAN continued operating between Japan and Korea 
throughout the summer of 1952 carrying personnel and supplies to the 
fighting area and launching strikes against the enemy.  She left the fighting 
zone 11 August for San Diego.  On 27 October the carrier once again stood 
out for the Far East and operated off Korea until 10 May 1953 when she 
departed for San Diego.
She remained in the San Diego area undergoing overhaul and training until 31 
July.  Then she sailed via Pearl Harbor to Kobe and Yokosuka, Japan, and then 
back to the United States where she reported for inactivation 26 August 
1953.  She went out of commission in reserve 9 April 1954 at San Francisco.
BATAAN received six battle stars for her World War II service.
