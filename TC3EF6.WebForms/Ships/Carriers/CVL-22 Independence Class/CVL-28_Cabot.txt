The second CABOT (CVL-28) was laid down as WILMINGTON (CL-79), 
redesignated CV-28 on 2 June 1942, renamed CABOT 23 June 1942, 
converted while building, and launched 4 April 1943 by New York 
Shipbuilding Co., Camden, N.J.; sponsored by Mrs. A. C. Read; reclassified 
CVL-28 on 15 July 1943; and commissioned 24 July 1943, Captain M. F. 
Shoeffel in command.
CABOT sailed from Quonset Point, R.I., 8 November 1943 for Pearl Harbor, 
where she arrived 2 December. Clearing for Majuro 15 January 1944, she 
joined TF 58 to begin the consistently high quality of war service which 
was to win her a Presidential Unit Citation. From 4 February to 4 March 
1944 she launched her planes in strikes on Roi, Namur, and the island 
stronghold of Truk, aiding in the neutralization of these Japanese bases as 
her part in the invasion of the Marshalls.
CABOT returned to Pearl Harbor for a brief repair period, but was back in 
action from Majuro for the pounding raids on the Palaus, Yap, Ulithi, and 
Woleai at the close of March 1944. She sailed to provide valuable air cover 
for the Hollandia operation from 22 to 25 April, and 4 days later began to 
hurl her air power at Truk, Satawan, and Ponape. She cleared Majuro again 6 
June for the preinvasion air strikes in the Marianas, and on 19 and 20 June 
launched sorties in the key Battle of the Philippine Sea, the famous 
"Marianas Turkey Shoot," which hopelessly crippled Japanese naval aviation. 
CABOT's air units pounded Japanese bases on Iwo Jima, Pagan, Rota, Guam, 
Yap and Ulithi as the carrier continued her support of the Marianas operation 
until 9 August.
Preinvasion strikes in the Palaus in September 1944 along with air attacks 
on Mindanao, the Visayas, and Luzon paved the way for the longawaited 
return to the Philippines. On 6 October CABOT sailed from Ulithi for raids on 
Okinawa, and to provide air cover for her task group during the heavy enemy 
attacks off Formosa on 12 and 13 October. CABOT joined the group which 
screened "Cripple Division 1," the cruisers CANBERRA (CA-70) and HOUSTON 
(CL-81) which had been torpedoed off Formosa, to the safety of the 
Carolines, then rejoined her group for continued air strikes on then Visayas, 
and the Battle for Leyte Gulf on 25 and 26 October.
CABOT remained on patrol off Luzon, conducting strikes in support of 
operations ashore, and repelling desperate suicide attacks. On 25 November 
a particularly vicious one occurred. CABOT had fought off several kamikazes 
when one, already flaming from hits, crashed the flight deck on the port 
side, destroying the still-firing 20 mm. gun platform, disabling the 40 mm. 
Mounts and a gun director: Another of CABOT's victims crashed close aboard 
and showered the port side with shrapnel and burning debris. CABOT lost 62 
men killed and wounded but careful training had produced a crew which 
handled damage control
smoothly and coolly. While she continued to maintain her station in 
formation and operate effectively, temporary repairs were made. On 28 
November she arrived at Ulithi for permanent repairs.
CABOT returned to action 11 December 1944, steaming with the force 
striking Luzon, Formosa, Indo-China, Hong Kong, and the Nansei Shoto in 
support of the Luzon operations. From 10 February to 1 March 1945 her 
planes pounded the Japanese homeland and the Bonins to suppress opposition 
to the invasion of Iwo Jima. Continued strikes against Kyushu and Okinawa 
in March prepared for the invasion of the latter island. After these 
prolonged, intensive operations, CABOT was homeward bound for San 
Francisco for a much-needed overhaul completed in June.
After refresher training at Pearl Harbor, the carrier launched strikes on 
Wake Island on 1 August while en route to Eniwetok. Here she remained on 
training duty until the end of the war. Sailing 21 August, she joined TG 38.3 
to support the landings of occupation troops in the Yellow Sea area in 
September and October. Embarking homeward-bound men at Guam, CABOT 
arrived at San Diego 9 November, then sailed for the east coast. CABOT was 
placed out of commission in reserve at Philadelphia 11 February 1947.
Recommissioned 27 October 1948, CABOT was assigned to the Naval Air 
Reserve training program. She operated out of Pensacola, then Quonset 
Point, on cruises to the Caribbean, and had one tour of duty in European 
waters from 9 January to 26 March 1952. CABOT was again placed out of 
commission in reserve 21 January 1955. She was reclassified AVT-3 on 15 
May 1959.
In addition to the Presidential Unit Citation, CABOT received nine battle 
stars for World War II service.
