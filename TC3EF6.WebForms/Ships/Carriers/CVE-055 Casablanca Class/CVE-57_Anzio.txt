Auxiliary aircraft carrier ACV-57 was laid down on 12 December 1942 by 
the Kaiser Shipbuilding Co., Vancouver, Wash. under a Maritime Commission 
contract (MC hull 1094); named ALIKULA BAY on 22 January 1943; renamed 
CORAL SEA on 3 April 1943; launched on 1 May 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Frank 
J. Fletcher, wife of Vice Admiral Fletcher; redesignated CVE-57 on 15 July 
1943; and commissioned at Astoria, Oreg., on 27 August 1943, Capt. Herbert 
W. Taylor in command.
On 24 September, CORAL SEA got underway for shakedown in Puget Sound. 
She arrived at San Diego, Calif., on 8 October to load aircraft and hold flight 
operations off the California coast. The carrier sailed for Hawaii on 25 
October and, upon arrival at Pearl Harbor, joined sister ship LISCOME BAY 
(CVE-56) for exercises off Oahu. On 10 November, CORAL SEA steamed 
southwest to join the American forces about to invade the Gilbert Islands. 
She launched strikes on Makin Island from 20 through 28 November. When 
Tarawa had been captured, CORAL SEA headed for Pearl Harbor and arrived 
there on 5 December. She paused to embark passengers and load aircraft for 
transport to the United States and departed on 8 December. The carrier 
arrived at Alameda, Calif., on 14 December to take on new planes. She put to 
sea on 22 December and steamed back to Hawaii. On 28 December, CORAL 
SEA anchored at Pearl Harbor and began preparations for the impending 
assault on Kwajalein.
The escort carrier was underway on 3 January 1944 for a series of 
exercises in Hawaiian waters. After final fitting out, she sailed on 22 
January in Task Group (TG) 52.9 and arrived in the vicinity of Kwajalein on 
31 January, two days after planes of the Fast Carrier Task Force began 
pounding airfields on the atoll. CORAL SEA provided direct and indirect air 
support for the amphibious landings. On 24 February, the ship set course for 
Eniwetok, but was recalled to Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 3 March.
After a brief respite, CORAL SEA got underway again on 11 March and 
proceeded to the Solomon Islands. She anchored at Tulagi on 21 March, 
topped off with fuel, and loaded stores. Sailing again on 30 March, the 
escort carrier headed for Emirau Island. From 1 to 11 April she launched 
planes in support of forces occupying Emirau and returned to Port Purvis on 
15 April.
The next day, CORAL SEA left Tulagi to assist in the reconquest of New 
Guinea. On the 19th, she joined TG 78.2, which was formed to support Allied 
footholds at Hollandia and Aitape. Her planes joined in strikes on the 22d of 
April, and, on 26 April, the escort carrier sailed to Seeadler Harbor for 
replenishment and on 7 May, headed for Espiritu Santo for availability.
Her repair period completed, the ship got underway on 8 June for Kwajalein, 
the staging point for the invasion of the Marianas. The American forces 
sortied on 10 June, and CORAL SEA helped to provide air support for landings 
by the 2d Marine Division on Saipan. She endured numerous Japanese air 
attacks during the next few days but received only minor damage. The 
carrier had moved south to Guam on 17 June to begin softening-up 
operations against that island but returned to Saipan the next day to assist 
the bogged-down American forces. CORAL SEA and her 
escorts retired to Eniwetok on 28 June but returned to Saipan on 4 July. Her 
planes made further air strikes before she put into Eniwetok on 15 July for 
repairs to her engines.  Ultimately, CORAL SEA was ordered back to the 
United States for a much needed overhaul, and the carrier sailed on 23 July.  
Two days later, she paused at Kwajalein to unload most of her aircraft and 
ammunition and then continued via Pearl Harbor for the naval base at San 
Diego.  CORAL SEA received word that her name had been changed to ANZIO 
as of 15 September.
ANZIO held sea trials off the California coast and was ready to sail for the 
western Pacific on 16 September and entered the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard for 
a tender availability.  On 8 October, the carrier began a series of training 
exercises; and, on the 16th, she set out for Eniwetok.  There, ANZIO joined a 
hunter/killer group and carried out an antisubmarine warfare (ASW) mission 
while she was en route to Ulithi.  ON 4 November, she was ordered to assist 
RENO (CL-96) which had been torpedoed in the Philippine Sea.  When ANZIO 
was relieved by EXTRACTOR (ARS-15), she resumed her ASW patrols and 
worked at that task through mid-February 1945, when she steamed to Iwo 
Jima.
ANZIO resumed combat support operations on 16 February.  Three days later, 
she launched a strike to the north on Chichi Jima in the Bonin Islands.  From 
19 February through 4 March, ANZIO followed a schedule of launching her 
first flight just before sunset and recovering her last just before dawn.  
During these nocturnal operations, she completed 106 sorties without a 
single accident.  ANZIO departed the Iwo Jima area on 8 March and entered 
San Pedro Bay at Leyte on 12 March.  After 10 days of upkeep, she sailed to 
join the invasion of Okinawa.  After providing air cover for an Okinawa-
bound amphibious group, the escort carrier joined other forces in the 
vicinity of Kerama Retto in seizing that island group to provide an advanced 
base for the Fleet.  The Okinawa attack began on 1 April, and ANZIO remained 
on line until she retired to Ulithi on 30 April for repairs to her rudder 
bearings.  On 21 May, the carrier resumed ASW operations in the Okinawa 
area.  This role ended 17 June, when ANZIO sailed to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, 
for upkeep.
ANZIO left the Philippines on 6 July to begin what proved to be her last stint 
of combat duty.  She joined TG 30.8 and positioned herself about 600 miles 
east of Tokyo. ANZIO made ASW patrols in support of Admiral Halsey's 
attacks on the Japanese home islands.  She received word of the Japanese 
capitulation on 15 August and sailed for Guam on 19 August.  After refitting 
and training new flight crews, the escort carrier headed for Okinawa.  From 
that point, she was to provide air cover and ASW patrol services for 
transports carrying occupation troops to Korea.  On 8 September, ANZIO 
anchored at Jinsen, Korea, whence she provided air support for the landings 
of the occupation force.  The escort carrier left Korea on 13 September and 
returned to Okinawa.  On 19 September, she broke her homeward-bound 
pennant, became a member of a MagicCarpet" group, and reached San 
Francisco on 30 September.
While at San Francisco, ANZIO was modified to provide maximum passenger 
accommodations.  The carrier made two trips to the western Pacific and 
back, one to Pearl Harbor and one to Shanghai, China, to shuttle American 
troops home.  ANZIO arrived at Seattle, Wash., on 23 December and ended the 
year at that port.
On 18 January 1946, ANZIO sailed for Norfolk, Va.  She paused at San 
Francisco then continued southward to transit the Panama Canal before 
finally reaching the east coast.  ANZIO was placed out of commission on 5 
August 1946 and became a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet berthed at 
Norfolk.  The ship was redesignated CVHE-57 on 15 June 1955.  ANZIO was 
struck from the Navy list on 1 March 1959 and sold to the Master Metals Co. 
on 24 November 1959.
ANZIO received six battle stars for service in World War II.
