GAMBIER BAY, originally classified AVG-73, was reclassified ACV-73 on 20 
August 1942 and again reclassified CVE-73 on 15 July 1943; launched under 
a Maritime Commission Contract by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Co., Vancouver, 
Wash., 22 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. H. C. Zitzewitz of Oswego, 
Oreg.; and commissioned at Astoria, Oreg., 28 December 1943, Captain Hugh 
H. Goodwin in command.
After shakedown out of San Diego, the escort carrier sailed 7 February 1944 
with 400 troops embarked for  Pearl Harbor, thence to rendezvous off the 
Marshalls where she flew 84 replacement planes to famed carrier 
ENTERPRISE (CV-6). She returned to San Diego via Peal Harbor, ferrying 
aircraft for repairs and qualified carrier pilots off the coast of Southern 
California. She departed 1 May to join Read Admiral H. B. Sallada's Carrier 
Support Group 2 (TG 52.11), staging in the Marshalls for the invasion of the 
Mariannas.
GAMBIER BAY gave close air support to the initial landings of Marines on 
Saipan 15 June 1944, destroying enemy gun emplacements, troops, tanks, 
and trucks. ON the 17th her combat air control shot down or turned back all 
but a handful of 47 enemy planes headed for her task group and her gunners 
shot down 2 of the 3 planes that did break through to attack her.
The following day, warning of another air attack sounded. As her fighters 
prepared to take off, they found intense antiaircraft fire of the entire task 
group covering their flight path. Nevertheless, in a harrowing feat termed by 
Capt. Goodwin as "another shining example of the adaptability and courage of 
the young men of our country," eight pilots of Composite Squadron 10 did 
take off to help repulse the aerial onslaught. GAMBIER BAY remained off 
Saipan, repulsing aerial raids and launching planes which strafed enemy 
troop concentrations, bombed gun emplacements, and supported marines and 
soldiers fighting ashore.  Meanwhile, American carriers slashed the carrier 
air strength of the combined Japanese Mobile Fleet and turned it back in 
defeat in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. GAMBIER BAY continued close 
ground support operations at Tinian (19-31 July), then turned her attention 
to Guam, where she gave identical aid to invading troops until 11 August.
After a respite for logistics in the Marshalls, GAMBIER BAY spent 15 to 28 
September supporting the amphibious attack which drove ashore and 
captured Peleliu and Angaur, Southern Palaus. She then steamed by way of 
Hollandia, New Guinea, to Manus, Admiralities, where the invasion of the 
Philippines was staged. Screened by four destroyer escorts, GAMBIER BAY 
and KITKUN BAY (CVE-71) escorted transports and amphibious landing ships 
safely to Leyte Gulf before joining Rear Admiral Clifton A. F. Sprague's 
escort carrier task unit 19 September off Leyte.
The task unit comprised six escort carriers, screened by three destroyers 
and four destroyer escorts, and was known by its voice radio call as "Taffy 
3." Under the command of Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague, eighteen escort 
carriers, divided into three "Taffy" units, maintained 
air supremacy over Leyte Gulf and eastern Leyte. During the invasion their 
planes destroyed enemy airfields, supply convoys, and troop concentrations; 
gave troops driving inland vital close air support; and maintained combat air 
patrol over ships in Leyte Gulf. While "Taffy 1" and "Taffy 2" were 
respectively stationed off northern Mindanao and off the entrance to Leyte 
Gulf, "Taffy 3" steamed off Samar.
Meanwhile, the Japanese threw their entire fleet against American naval 
power in desperate gamble to destroy the largest concentration of American 
shipping in Leyte Gulf. Powerful enemy forces, comprised of carriers, 
battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, converged on the Philippines in a 
three pronged attack to the south, center, and north. The Japanese Southern 
Force met disaster before dawn 25 October as it tried to drive through 
Suriago Strait to join the center force off Leyte Gulf. While steaming 
through the Subiyan Sea enroute to San Bernardino Strait, the Center Force 
was hit hard on the 24th by hundreds of planes from Admiral Halsey's fast 
attack carriers. After the Battle of Subiyan Sea, Admiral Halsey no longer 
considered the Center Force a serious menace, and he sent the carriers north 
to intercept decoy carriers of the Japanese Northern Force off Cape Engano.
These swift moving events left the escort carriers of "Taffy 3" as lone 
sentinels off Samar, and unaware of the nighttime movement of the Center 
Force. However, shortly after sunrise 25 October, a gap in the morning mist 
disclosed the pagoda-like mast of enemy battleships and cruisers on the 
northern horizon. The still dangerous enemy force of more than 20 ships had 
slipped undetected through San Bernardino Strait and down the fog-shrouded 
coast of Samar, bound for Leyte Gulf.
Despite the probable outcome of an engagement between two so unequal 
surface forces, the presence of enemy ships in Leyte Gulf was unthinkable; 
and "Taffy 3" turned to do battle against the enemy. Immediately an urgent 
call for help went out from "Taffy 3" as the escort carriers steamed 
eastward and launched planes that performed seemingly impossible feats: 
scoring hits with torpedoes, bombs, and strafing until their ammunition ran 
out, then making dummy runs to break the enemy formation and delay its 
advance. Smoke was laid down to cover their running fight as the gallant 
destroyers docked in and out of the mist and smoke to charge battleship, 
cruiser, and destroyer formations point-blank until ordered back to cover 
the escort carriers with more smoke. The lone 5-inch gun of GAMBIER BAY 
spat out at an enemy cruise that shelling her; and destroyer HEERMAN (DD-
532) made an unsuccessful effort under the combined fire of the heavy ships 
to save GAMBIER BAY.
GAMBIER BAY was soon dead in the water as three cruisers closed to point 
blank range. Fires raged through the riddled escort carrier. She capsized and 
sank at 0907, 25 October 1944 with the majority of her nearly 800 
survivors rescued by landing and patrol craft dispatched from Leyte Gulf. 
Three other ships, gallantly fighting to the end, went down: HOEL (DD-533); 
SAMUEL B. ROBERTS (DE-413); and JOHNSTON (DD-557). The latter used only 
her 5-inch guns in a dummy torpedo run that thwarted the torpedo attack of 
an entire Japanese Destroyer Squadron lead by a cruiser.
Aircraft from "Taffy 2" joined in the epic battle off Samar. The events that 
followed are best described in Admiral Sprague's own words: "At 0925 my 
mind was occupied with dodging torpedoes when near the bridge I heard one 
of the signalmen yell 'They're getting away!" I could hardly believe my eyes, 
but it looked as if the whole Japanese fleet was indeed retiring. However, it 
took a whole series of reports from circling planes to convince me. And still 
I could not get the fact to soak into my battle-numbed brain. At best, I had 
expected to be swimming by this time."
GAMBIER BAY and other ships of "Taffy 3," aided by planes of "Taffy 2" had 
stopped the powerful Japanese Center Force and inflicted a great 
loss. Two enemy cruisers were sunk and much damage inflicted on the 
other ships of this overwhelmingly powerful surface fleet, turned back in 
the last analysis by the indomitable spirit of the men of the escort 
carriers and their screen of destroyers and destroyer-escorts.
GAMBIER BAY received four battle stars for service in World War II and 
shared in the award of the Presidential Unit Citation to "Taffy 3" for 
extraordinary heroism in the battle off Samar.
