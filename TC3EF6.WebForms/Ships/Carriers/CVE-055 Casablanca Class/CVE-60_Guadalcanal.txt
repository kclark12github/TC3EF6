The first GUADALCANAL (CVE-60) an escort aircraft carrier, was converted 
from a Maritime Commission hull by Kaiser Co., Inc., of Vancouver, Wash. 
Originally ATROLABE BAY (AVG 60), she was reclassified ACV-60, 20 August 
1942 and launched as GUADALCANAL (ACV-60) 5 June 1943, sponsored by 
Mrs. Alvin I. Malstrom. She was reclassified CVE 60 on 15 July 1943; and 
commissioned at Astoria, Oreg., 25 September 1943, Captain D. V. Gallery in 
command.
After shakedown training, GUADALCANAL performed pilot qualifications out 
of San Diego, Calif., and then departed 15 November 1943, via the Panama 
Canal, for Norfolk, Va., arriving 3 December. There she became flagship of 
antisubmarine task group 21.12, and with her escort destroyers set out from 
Norfolk 5 January 1944 in search of enemy submarines in the North Atlantic. 
On 16 January aircraft from GUADALCANAL sighted three submarines fueling 
on the surface and in a rocket and bombing attack succeeded in sinking 
German submarine U-544. Re-

plenishing at Casablanca, the task group headed back for Norfolk and repairs, 
arriving 16 February.
Departing again with her escorts 7 March, GUADALCANAL sailed without 
incident to Casablanca and got underway from that port 30 March with a 
convoy bound for the United States. Scouring the waters around the convoy 8 
April northwest of Madeira, the task group discovered German submarine U-
515 and closed in for the kill. GUADALCANAL aircraft and destroyers 
CHATELAIN, FLAHERTY, PILLSBURY, and POPE made several well coordinated 
attacks on the intruder with rockets and depth charges throughout the night. 
Losing depth control on the afternoon of 9 April, the submarine was forced 
to surface amid the waiting ships, and was immediately devastated by point 
blank rocket and gunfire. As Wildcat fighters from GUADALCANAL strafed 
the submarine, her captain, German ace Kapitanleutenant Werner Henke, 
ordered abandon ship and she went to the bottom.
Again on the night of 10 April the task group caught German submarine U68 
on the surface in broad moonlight 300 miles south of the Azores and sank 
her with depth charges and rocket fire. The convoy arrived safely at Norfolk 
26 April 1944.
After voyage repairs at Norfolk, GUADALCANAL and her escorts departed 
Hampton Roads for sea again 15 May 1944. Two weeks of cruising brought no 
contacts, and the task force decided to head for the coast of Africa to 
refuel. Ten minutes after reversing course, however, CHATELAIN detected a 
submarine, U-505. The destroyer loosed one depth charge attack and, guided 
in for a more accurate drop by circling Avenger aircraft from 
GUADALCANAL, soon made a second. This pattern blasted a hole in the outer 
hull of the submarine, and rolled the U-boat on its beam ends. Shouts of 
panic from the conning tower led her inexperienced 
captain to believe his boat was doomed, so he blew his tanks and surfaced, 
barely 700 yards from CHATELAIN. The destroyer fired a torpedo, which 
missed, and the surfaced submarine then came under the combined fire of 
the escorts and aircraft, forcing her crew to abandon ship.
Captain Gallery had been waiting and planning for such an opportunity, and 
having already trained and equipped his boarding parties, ordered 
PILLSBURY's boat to make for the German sub and board her. Under the 
command of Lt. (jg) A. L. David, the party leaped onto the slowly circling 
submarine and found it abandoned. Braving unknown dangers below, David and 
his men quickly captured all important papers and books while closing 
valves and stopping leaks. As Pillsbury attempted to get a tow-line on her, 
like a cowboy roping a steer, the party managed to stop her engines. By this 
time a larger salvage group from GUADALCANAL arrived, and began the work 
of preparing U-505 to be towed. After securing the tow-line and picking up 
the German survivors from the sea, GUADALCANAL started for Bermuda with 
her priceless prize in tow. Fleet tug ABNAKI rendezvoused with the task 
group and took over towing duties, the group arriving in Bermuda 19 June.
For their daring and skillful teamwork in this remarkable capture, 
GUADALCANAL and her escorts shared in a Presidential Unit Citation. The 
captured submarine proved to be of inestimable value to American 
intelligence, and its true fate was kept secret from the Germans until the 
end of the war.
(U-505 is now on display at the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago, 
Illinois, USA. LWJ)
Arriving in Norfolk 22 June 1944, GUADALCANAL spent only a short time in 
port before setting out again on patrol. She departed Norfolk 15 July and 
between then and 1 December made three anti-submarine cruises in the 
Western Atlantic. She sailed 1 December for a training period in waters off 
Bermuda and Cuba that included refresher landings for pilots of her new 
squadron, gunnery practice, and anti-submarine warfare drills with Italian 
submarine R-9. GUADALCANAL arrived Mayport, Fla., for carrier 
qualifications 15 December and subsequently engaged in further training in 
Cuban water until 13 February 1946 when she arrived back in Norfolk. After 
another short training cruise to the Caribbean, she steamed into Mayport 15 
March for a tour of duty as carrier qualification ship, later moving to 
Pensacola for similar operations. After qualifying nearly 4,000 pilots, 
GUADALCANAL returned to Norfolk, Va., and decommissioned there 15 July 
1946.
GUADALCANAL entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Nor folk and was 
redesignated CVU-60 on 15 July 1955, while still in reserve. Her name was 
finally stricken from the Navy List 27 May 1958 and she was sold for scrap 
to the Hugo Neu Corp. of New York 30 April 1959.
GUADALCANAL was awarded three battle stars and a Presidential Unit 
Citation for service in World War II.
EXCERPT FROM AFTER-ACTION REPORT:
...The sub at this point was running in a tight circle to the right, fully 
surfaced and it was known that most of her crew had abandoned her.
PART III THE CAPTURE
At 1135 ComCortDiv 4 ordered the JENKS and CHATELAIN to pick up 
survivors and sent away the PILLSBURY's boarding party.
At 1203 the carrier headed back toward the scene of action to get her 
boarding parties aboard, having in the meantime recovered the fighter 
planes which had assisted the CHATELAIN. Carrier's boarding parties were 
called away at 1230.
After lowering her boat the PILLSBURY pursued the sub around the circle 
trying to get lines aboard. From the carrier's bridge it looked for all the 
world like rodeo with a cowboy trying to rope a wild horse. The PILLSBURY 
did rope the sub, several times. The first time she got a line aboard, CTG 
22.3 broadcast by TBS:
"Bluejay to Dagwood-Ridem Cowboy. Out"
But in the struggle alongside the runaway sub the PILLSBURY was holed by 
the bow planes of the sub, and one engine room was flooded to the water 
line, forcing her to haul clear and stop.
Meantime the PILLSBURY's boarding party, commanded by Lieut. (j.g.) A. L. 
David, had gotten alongside and leaped from the whaleboat to the deck of the 
circling sub. There was only one dead man on deck, but the boarders did not 
know how many men might be below. The sub was still running at about 7 
knots and it seemed highly probable that part of the crew was still below 
setting demolition charges and scuttling. Without hesitation this party took 
their lives in their hands and plunged down the conning tower hatch to 
capture and save the boat. They found no none below and immediately went 
to work closing valves, 6" in diameter, was pouring into the boat. Then, not 
knowing at what moment the boat might either blow up or sink, they turned 
to, seizing all the important looking papers they could find and passing them 
up on deck.
...
CONCLUSION
From the time that we sailed from Norfolk the whole task group was 
determined that we would come back dragging a sub behind us ... and they had 
what it took to do it.  When remarkable luck was required, we had it. When 
perfect cooperation between aircraft and surface vessels was required it 
was there. When a clean cut knock out punch was needed, the CHATELAIN 
produced it. When outstanding heroism was required, it was commonplace 
among the boarding parties.
I believe every man in the task group would have volunteered for the 
boarding parties, and those who could not go were very envious of those who 
did.
It is a great pleasure to report that all hands in the task group did their duty 
in an exemplary manner in keeping with the highest traditions of the U. S. 
Navy.
