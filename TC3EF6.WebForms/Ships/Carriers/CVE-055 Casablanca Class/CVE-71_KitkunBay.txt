KITKUN BAY, originally designated as an AVG, was classified as ACV-71 on 
20 August 1942 and reclassified as CVE-71 on 16 July 1943. Laid down 3 
May 1943 she was launched 8 November 1943 by Kaiser Shipbuilding Co., 
Inc., Vancouver, Wash., under a Maritime Commission contract ; sponsored by 
Mrs. Edward A. Cruise, and commissioned 15 December 1943, Captain J. P. 
Whitney in command.
After a shakedown along the Pacific coast, KITKUN BAY departed San Diego 
28 January 1944 on a replenishment voyage to the New Hebrides bases. 
After loading passengers, planes, and other cargo, she sailed for home 18 
February via Pearl Harbor and arrived San Diego 6 March. Upon her return, the 
planes of VC-6 were brought aboard for training and assignment. With Rear 
Admiral Harold B. Salada, Commander, Carrier Division 26 embarked, she 
sailed 1 May for Pearl Harbor and the completion of her training exercises.
On 31 May her task unit sortied forth to escort the bombardment and 
transports units of Task Group 52.17 to Saipan. On 13 June her planes shot 
down their first enemy aircraft and the next day began the bombing and 
strafing of enemy positions in the Marianas. KITKUN BAY's planes alternated 
flying support missions for the Saipan landings and air cover for ships east 
of this island. Eight enemy planes were splashed in attacks on her formation 
on the 17th and her own guns downed three more the

nest day. Early July brought a brief respite at Eniwetok but 14 July she 
resumed support sorties at Saipan, Tinian, and from 2 to 4 August at Guam.
Withdrawn, she steamed to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, for upkeep before 
sailing to the Solomons for additional practice in support of amphibious 
operations. Heading westward on 8 September her task unit escorted an 
assault force to Peleliu and Angaur Islands in the Palaus group and provided 
cover from the 15th to 21st. Withdrawn to Manus, Admiralty Islands, she 
made preparations for the invasion of Leyte, P.I., and her finest hour.
Departing 12 October she soon joined Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague's task 
unit "Taffy 3" composed of 6 CVE's and their screen of escorts. On 20 
October KITKUN BAY began launching strikes against Leyte. These operations 
conducted from a position east of Samar Island continued until early in the 
morning of the 25th when Japanese warships were sighted on the northwest 
horizon. Admiral Kurita's powerful Center Force had passed through the San 
Bernadino Straits unnoticed, hoping to destroy the supply ships off Leyte. 
Not designed to exchange gunfire with surface warships "Taffy 3" launched 
what planes were ready and turned southward behind a smoke screen. In the 
ensuing 2-hour running battle, the courageous maneuvers and skillful action 
of its screen, the 
diverting attacks by its planes, the astute orders of its command officers 
averted annihilation. In the forefront of the circular formation KITKUN BAY 
escaped any direct hits as the shells splashed ever closer until 0925 when 
the enemy suddenly broke off the engagement and retired. The less fortunate 
GAMBIER BAY and three escort ships went down fighting valiantly; while 
suffering some gunfire damage, the Center Farce lost three cruisers as a 
result of the attacks of the aircraft of "Taffies 2 and 3."
The final phase of the epic Battle of Leyte Gulf was the retaliatory air 
strikes by both sides. Before the "Fore noon" watch had expired, KITKUN BAY 
had splashed a suicidal Betty but had also been crashed by a Zeke which 
struck the port catwalk killing 1 man and wounding 16. The losses for the 
day also included two planes and their crews. The nest day she sailed for 
Manus in the Admiralty Islands for replenishment and repairs.
Arrived 1 November, she departed Manus the 7th for Pearl Harbor where VC-
5 was replaced by VC-91. Despite a submarine attack en route, KITKUN BAY 
returned safely to Manus 17 December. New Year's Day 1945 dawned with 
CVE-71 steaming as part of Task Unit 77.4.3 (Lingayen Transport Cover 
Group) bound for the invasion of western Luzon. After passing through 
Surigao Straits, the convoy underwent a series of air attacks. Air cover 
destroyed seven enemy planes but at 1857 an Oscar got through and crashed 
KITKUN BAY's portside amidships at the waterline. Almost simultaneously a 
5-inch shell struck her starboard side. The resultant fires and flooding were 
brought under control but 16 were dead and 37 wounded. The following day 
with a list and only one engine operating she withdrew and proceeded by 
stages first to Leyte, Manus, Pearl Harbor and arrived San Pedro, Calif., 28 
February.
Two months later she sailed again for the Western Pacific. After a training 
period in the Hawaiian Islands, she departed 15 June for Ulithi and duty with 
the 3d Fleet. On 3 July KITKUN BAY sortied forth with other escorts and 
ships of the "train" for support of the fast carriers operating off the coast 
of Japan. Mid-August she was reassigned to Task Force 44 gathering at 
Adak, Alaska, to escort Admiral F. J. Fletcher, COMNORPAC, who had been 
designated to receive the formal surrender of the Japanese in northern 
Honshu and Hokkaido. Arrived off Honshu 7 September, she remained in the 
area until the 27th, seeing to the feeding and transportation of American 
prisoners of war. Detached to participate in Operation "Magic Carpet," she 
first debarked 554 troops at San Francisco 19 October. Additional voyages 
to Pearl Harbor and Okinawa concluded 12 January 1946 at San Pedro, Calif.
KITKUN BAY entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, 18 February and 
decommissioned 19 April. Sold 18 November 1946 to Zidell Machinery & 
Supply Co., Portland, Oreg., she was scrapped early in 1947.
In addition to the Presidential Unit Citation KITKUN BAY earned six battle 
stars during World War II.
