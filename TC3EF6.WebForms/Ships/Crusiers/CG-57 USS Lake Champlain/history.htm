<b><U>USS LAKE CHAMPLAIN (CG 57) HISTORY</U></b> 
<P>
The USS LAKE CHAMPLAIN is named after a joint land and naval attack
from Canada down Lake Champlain into New York State during the
War of 1812. The American naval commander on the lake, Captain
Thomas Macdonough, had long sensed that control of the lake was
essential to the defense of New York. He had there built up a
fleet of 4 ships and 10 gunboats. When the British Captain Downie's
ships entered the lake, Macdonough deployed his vessels in a narrow
channel across the bay from Plattsburgh and ordered anchors dropped.
On September 11, the British ships rounded Cumberland Head to
open the battle at a range of 500 yards. For two hours a gun duel
raged with no marked advantage to eitherside. The British were
forced to advance on Macdonough without bringing all their guns
to bear. Macdonough then swung his ships about bringing fresh
guns to bear on the British, forcing Downie to strike his colors.
Within 30 minutes the battle was over, with the four British warships
seized or destroyed. With the loss of his naval arm, the British
commander was forced to retreat back to Canada. Lake Champlain
proved to be the last battle of the war in the North. It was one
of the few times in history that ships at anchor won a naval battle.

USS LAKE CHAMPLAIN is the eleventh ship of the Aegis-equipped
Ticonderoga class guided missile cruiser. It is the sixth ship
to be built with the MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS).
