<p> <b><u>USS LAKE CHAMPLAIN (CG 57) CREST</u>:</b> </p>

<p> Shield: Dark blue and gold are the traditional colors
associated with the Navy and symbolize the sea and excellence.
The green and white border around the blue field represents the
Lake Champlain and the surrounding terrain where two significant
naval battles were fought. The first, the Revolutionary War
Battle of Valcour Island, is symbolized by the white star on the
crest. The second, the War of 1812 Battle of Lake Champlain, is
represented by the anchor and cannon on the blue field. The
partitions of the border suggest rotation or turning and allude
to the American ships' movements during the Battle of Lake
Champlain. The vertical position of the naval gun exemplifies the
vertical capabilities of the AEGIS CG class naval ship. </p>

<p> Crest: The eagle bearing in its talons the Naval swords:
symbolizes martial strength and the American victory at Lake
Champlain. The two swords also represent two previous ships named
Lake Champlain. The aggressive action and flight capabilities of
the eagle highlight the second ship, the aircraft carrier CV 39,
active during the Korean War. The wavy bar represents the Lake
Champlain itself. The gold four-pointed star indicates the four
missions of a modern AEGIS cruiser, i.e., to offensively engage
aircraft, missiles, submarines and surface ships. </p>
