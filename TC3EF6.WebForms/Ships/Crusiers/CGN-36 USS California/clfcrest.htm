<p><b>CREST OF USS CALIFORNIA (CGN 36)</b> </p>
</center>

<p>The central figure is a grizzly bear, selected because of its
status as the state animal of California. The bear also
symbolizes the power and tenacity embodied in the CGN-36 class
ship. The stance of the bear is identical with that of the bear
in the California state flag and, against the ocean background,
signifies the long &quot;strides&quot; that nuclear-powered
cruisers are able to take across the sea. Like USS CALIFORNIA,
the bear's presence is commanding but not hostile. </p>

<p>The atom behind the bear represents the ship's nuclear
propulsion. The missile on the border of the insignia symbolizes
CALIFORNIA's weapons capabilities, while the lightning bolt
signifies the cruiser's extensive command, control, communication
and surveillance systems. </p>
