<center><p><font SIZE=+2><b>HISTORY OF USS CALIFORNIA (CGN 36)</b> </font></p></center>

<p>The &quot;Golden Grizzly&quot; began commissioned naval service more
than twenty years ago in Norfolk, Virginia. For ten years, CALIFORNIA steamed
the Atlantic and Indian Oceans as well as the Mediterranean Sea from this
homeport, serving three times with the Sixth Fleet and twice with the Seventh
Fleet. </p>

<p>In the summer of 1977, CALIFORNIA represented the United States Surface
Fleet at the Silver Jubilee Review in Portsmouth, England. More than 150
warships from 18 nations participated in this commemoration of the 25th
anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's coronation. </p>

<p>Two years later, following seizure of the U. S. Embassy in Iran, CALIFORNIA,
along with USS NIMITZ (CVN 68) and USS TEXAS (CGN 39), interrupted a routine
Mediterranean cruise to steam to the southern coast of Iran in the North
Arabian Sea. The all-nuclear task group completed the 12,000-mile transit
in only eighteen days, remained on station in the Indian Ocean for the
next five months, and eventually returned to Norfolk from the 80,000-mile,
nine-month deployment in May of 1980. </p>

<p>The following year, CALIFORNIA completed its second Indian Ocean cruise.
Upon returning to Norfolk via the Panama Canal, the cruiser became the
first nuclear-powered surface ship to circumnavigate the globe since the
USS ENTERPRISE task force completed Operation Sea Orbit in 1964. </p>

<p>In September 1983, the cruiser left Norfolk for the last time, steaming
through the Panama Canal to its new homeport, Naval Air Station, Alameda,
California. The ship embarked on its first Western Pacific and Indian Ocean
cruise in February 1985 as a member of the USS CONSTELLATION (CV 64) battle
group. During the spring of 1986, CALIFORNIA conducted several weeks of
Bering Sea operations and became the first cruiser to visit Adak, Alaska,
since World War II. It again deployed to the Western Pacific and completed
a second &quot;Around-the-World&quot; cruise in 1987. </p>

<p>The year 1988 brought continued high-tempo operations as CALIFORNIA
cruised the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans for a third time. The ship
served as battle group Anti-Surface Warfare Commander during the RIMPAC
88 exercise as well as for Olympic Presence Operations off the Korean Peninsula.
Subsequently, CALIFORNIA assumed duties as Anti-Air Warfare Commander for
operations in the North Arabian Sea and Arabian Gulf. While assigned patrol
duties in the Strait of Hormuz in December 1988, CALIFORNIA conducted the
last USN EARNEST WILL convoy mission through the strait. </p>

<p>The summer of 1989 saw CALIFORNIA tasked with Northern Pacific operations
as part of a CNO project to study the effects of near-land operating areas
on carrier battle group operations. In September and October, the &quot;Golden
Grizzly&quot; participated as an anti-air-warfare picket ship in PACEX
89, the largest combined sailing of U. S. and allied naval units since
World War II. </p>

<p>In April 1990, CALIFORNIA entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in
Bremerton, Washington for a three-year refueling complex overhaul, including
new high endurance reactor cores and the New Treat Upgrade Combat Systems
Suite. Upon completion of the overhaul in January 1993, CALIFORNIA began
a series of exercises and evaluations in preparation for deployment. These
included independent training in all aspects of its mission as well as
coordinated battle group exercises. </p>

<p>In June 1994, CALIFORNIA joined the USS KITTY HAWK battle group in the
Western Pacific for the ship's first deployment in five years. CALIFORNIA
exchanged personnel with the Republic of Korea Navy for a combined exercise
and with the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force for ANNUALEX 06G and
KEEN EDGE 95. The cruiser also took part in an exercise with United States
forces in and near Korea, establishing the most extensive tactical data
link ever in this region. The deployment wrapped up with participation
in TANDEM THRUST 95, a joint exercise with the armed forces of the United
States and several allied nations. </p>

<p>CALIFORNIA then returned to its home at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard
just before Christmas 1994. </p>

<p>In May 1996, CALIFORNIA left for the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans
and the Arabian Gulf on a routine six-month deployment. </p>
