<p><center> SYMBOLISM </center> </p>

<p>SHIELD: The history of the name Ticonderoga, and of the four
ships which have borne that name, is represented by the symbols
on the shield. The name Ticonderoga is from the Iroquois Indian
word meaning &quot;between two waters,&quot; and is symbolized by
the white band separating the blue lower half of the shield. The
four dark blue stars symbolize the previous four ships bearing
the name TICONDEROGA. The historical capture of Fort Ticonderoga
is commemorated by the embattled partition line, with the gold
lion on the red field above it signifying our British adversary
during the Revolutionary war. The motto &quot;FIRST AEGIS
CRUISER&quot; emphasizes the significance of the new combat
system, and the ship which carries it. </p>

<p>CREST: The AEGIS Weapons System, a new dimension in surface
ship combat systems, which has as its motto, &quot;Shield of the
Fleet,&quot; is symbolized by the blue shield of a shape
distinctive to the AEGIS System. The single gold star represents
CG 47, the fifth ship to bear the name TICONDEROGA, and the first
combatant to carry the shield to sea. The spears extending from
the shield reflect TICONDEROGA's mighty offensive armament
capabilities and unparalleled firepower which permit her to
operate in a multi-threat environment and take on any air,
surface, and subsurface target which the Battle Group might
encounter. </p>
