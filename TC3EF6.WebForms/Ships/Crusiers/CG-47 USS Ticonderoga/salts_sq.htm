<p><b>&quot;Use of email links to U.S. Navy ships via
COMNAVSURFLANT Web pages have been restricted to users who have
an authorized .mil account and are conducting official government
business. This action has been taken because of recent episodes
with inappropriate use of email. We are researching and will
provide detailed information on how to send email to U.S. Navy
ship personnel for those who do not have a .mil account</p>

<p></p>

<p>NOTE: As of the date of this notice, we have been informed
that there will be a transmission fee payable by the sender for
each of the personal email notes directed to the ships. We will
provide fee information when it becomes available to us.&quot;</b></p>

<pre>Authentication is based on entries in the Domain Name System (DNS). If your 
computer is in the .mil domain and you are being denied service here, 
it is most likely because your computer is not properly identified as a host 
in a domain name server. 

Please contact your site network manager and have your host added to 
your name server forward and reverse look-up files. If you have any questions 
regarding this, send email to <a href="mailto:sst@force.cnsl.spear.navy.mil">sst@force.cnsl.spear.navy.mil</a>
