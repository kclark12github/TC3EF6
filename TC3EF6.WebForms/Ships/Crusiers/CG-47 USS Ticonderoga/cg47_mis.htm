<p><center> MISSION </center> </p>

<p>The primary mission of the Commander, Naval Surface Force,
U.S. Atlantic Fleet is to provide ready ships and personnel in
support of the United States Atlantic Fleet and Naval Forces,
Europe. The Naval Surface Force Commander prescribes readiness
and training requirements for assigned Forces, and ensures that
deploying units meet prescribed readiness standards. The Surface
Force Command includes all of the ships in the Atlantic and
Mediterranean Fleets, with the exception of the CV-type aircraft
carriers, submarines, submarine support ships, and Military
Sealift Command vessels. </p>

<p>The lead ship of the Guided Missile AEGIS Cruiser Class, <a
href="../../crusiers/cg-47%20uss%20ticonderoga/CG47P.GIF">TICONDEROGA</a>
is the first surface combatant equipped with the AEGIS Weapons
System, the most sophisticated air defense system in the world.
TICONDEROGA also brings a tremendous multi-warfare capability to
the Fleet and will significantly strengthen Battle Group
operation effectiveness, defense, and survivability. In addition
to the AEGIS Weapons System, which is designed to defeat
attacking missiles and provide quick reaction, high firepower,
and jamming resistance to deal with the Anti-Air Warfare threat
expected to be faced by the Battle Group, its strong Anti-
Submarine Warfare Suite and solid Anti-Surface Warfare
capabilities make TICONDEROGA a potent combatant, indeed. The
Navy's latest Electronic Warfare Suite is also aboard. </p>

<p>Four years under construction, TICONDEROGA was built at
Ingalls Shipbuilding, where her sister ship, USS YORKTOWN, was
nearing completion, with four other AEGIS Class cruisers in
various stages of their construction cycle, also having been
built in Pascagoula, Mississippi. </p>

<p>TICONDEROGA, using the SPRUANCE Class hull, measures 567 feet
from bow to stern. Her beam is 55 feet, and her displacement is
9,600 tons. In addition to the AEGIS Weapons System, she carries
two Phalanx Close- In-Weapons Systems, two 5&quot;/54-caliber
guns, two MK 26 Guided Missile Launching Systems, A LAMPS MK I
Helicopter, Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC) Torpedoes,
over-the-side torpedoes, and Harpoon Missiles. </p>
