<p><center> THE CONSTRUCTION OF USS TICONDEROGA (CG 47) </center>
</p>

<p>The commissioning of the <a
href="../../crusiers/cg-47%20uss%20ticonderoga/CG47P.GIF">USS
TICONDEROGA (CG 47)</a> is a momentous occasion for the nation
and the Navy. </p>

<p>Authorized in Fiscal Year 1978, TICONDEROGA's keel laying
ceremony occurred on 27 January 1980. Over the next three years,
Combat Systems Engineers and Computer Technicians, as well as
riveters, welders and Propulsion Engineers worked together as
members of a unique team to create this formidable warship. On 25
April 1981, TICONDEROGA was launched, and for the first time was
afloat in her natural environment. The following month, on 16 May
1981, the then First Lady, <a
href="../../crusiers/cg-47%20uss%20ticonderoga/CG47SP.GIF">Mrs.
Nancy Reagan</a>, the ship's sponsor, accompanied by military and
civilian dignitaries, christened TICONDEROGA, with some 9,000
people in attendance. An extensive test and check-out effort and
outfitting period was then undertaken as the mighty hull was
brought to life. TICONDEROGA men arrived in Pascagoula in July
1981 and crew training, certification and systems check-out were
underway. Sea trials were held in May, August, and November of
1982. During the first trial, TICONDEROGA's propulsion systems
were stringently tested, passing with flying colors. The new
cruiser accomplished a four-hour run at full power, achieving a
speed in excess of 30 knots. </p>

<p>On its second trial, TICONDEROGA and her Navy crew
accomplished an unprecedented &quot;Navy First.&quot; She flexed
her muscles for the first time, 6 months prior to commissioning,
by successfully firing every weapon system on board. This
included two Anti-Surface Harpoon Blast Test Missiles, 11
Surface-to-Air Blast Test Missiles, 5&quot;/54-Caliber Gun
Ammunition, CIWS and, finally, two Standard Surface-to-Air
Missiles against drone air targets off Eglin Missile Range. The
latter was a complete success, and the TICONDEROGA, &quot;the
First and Formidable,&quot; had truly accomplished a
&quot;first&quot; with TICONDEROGA men manning and firing the
combat system in cooperation with Ingalls' employees and civilian
contractors. </p>

<p>TICONDEROGA was delivered to the Navy on 13 December 1982.
Following commissioning, she moved to Norfolk, her home port.
During the next year, CG 47 was scheduled to participate in
extensive Combat System and Engineering Exercises, as well as
intensive single ship and Battle Group readiness evolutions. She
returnd to Pascagoula in the Summer for a six-week Post-Shakedown
Availability. </p>

<p>Cruiser construction went on in the shipyard as it continued
to build the second, third, and fourth TICONDEROGA Class
cruisers. But for TICONDEROGA, it was time to undertake the duty
for which she was built, as she brought her strength and power
into the service for her country. TICONDEROGA sailed from
Pascagoula in February, truly &quot;Combat Ready,&quot; with a
demanding schedule ahead, and with the knowledge that her
systems, construction, and the TICONDEROGA men who man her are
the very best. &quot;Stand by Admiral Gorshkov, AEGIS is at
sea.&quot; </p>

<p>TICONDEROGA was built in sections, called modules, which
allowed improved access to all areas of the ship during
construction. The modules were then moved together to form the
hull of the ship, and the deckhouse sections were then lifted
aboard. For launching, the ship was moved several hundred yards
across land to the floating dry dock, which was used to actually
launch the ship. </p>

<p><center> THE &quot;FIFTH&quot; TICONDEROGA </center> </p>

<p><center> When the Department of Navy announced in February
1980 that the lead </center> ship of a new class of
AEGIS-equipped, guided missile cruisers would be called
TICONDEROGA, it marked the fifth time in U.S. Navy history that a
ship would bear that historic name. </p>

<p>The newest ship was named, not after the great stone fortress
itself, but in commemoration of the capture of <a
href="../../crusiers/cg-47%20uss%20ticonderoga/CG47NS.GIF">Fort
Ticonderoga</a> on 10 May 1775 by Ethan Allen and the Green
Mountain Boys. </p>

<p>The first ship named TICONDEROGA (1814 - 1825) was a 17-gun
schooner of Commodore MacDonough's Flotilla in the victorious
Battle of Lake Champlain on 11 September 1814. </p>

<p>The second TICONDEROGA (1863 - 1881) was a steam sloop-of-war
which served with distinction during the Civil War. </p>

<p>A former German cargo ship was transformed into the third
TICONDEROGA (1917 - 1918), which served the Naval Overseas
Transportation Service during World War I. </p>

<p>The fourth ship was the famed aircraft carrier, affectionately
known as &quot;The Big T,&quot; which served from 1944 to 1973,
earning 17 Battle Stars for service during World War II and the
Vietnam War. The carrier also received three awards of the Navy
Unit Commendation and the Meritorious Unit Commendation for
service during the Vietnam War. </p>

<p><center> CHRISTENING OF USS TICONDEROGA (CG 47) 16 MAY 1981 </center>
</p>

<p><a href="../../crusiers/cg-47%20uss%20ticonderoga/CG47SP.GIF">Mrs.
Navy Reagan</a>, America's then First Lady, smashed a champagne
bottle across the bow of TICONDEROGA (CG 47) on Armed Forces Day
1981 at Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries in
Pascagoula, Mississippi. </p>

<p>The christening of a ship is a time-honored tradition. Ever
since man first set out upon the ocean and felt the fury of the
sea, he has known the need for spiritual blessing upon his ship.
The sponsoring of a ship is a great honor and a great
responsibility. At christening, the sponsor enters into a very
special relationship with her ship, which lasts throughout the
ship's entire life. </p>
