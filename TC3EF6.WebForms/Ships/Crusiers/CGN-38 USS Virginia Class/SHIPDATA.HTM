<A NAME="mk26"><B>Mk26 Missile Launcher</B></A><BR>
One each fore and aft.  Shoots SM1-MR, SM2-MR, and ASROCs.  To the best of my knowledge, neither launcher was ever fired in anger.<P>
Oulie: about six laps around the launchers makes a mile.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="mk54"><B>Mk45  5"/54 cal Gun</B></A><BR>
One each fore and aft.  Capable of engaging air or surface targets.  The gun mount is unmanned, with a gun crew stationed below decks.  Max firing rate is 16-20 rounds/minute.<BR>Virginia used it's 5" guns for naval bombardment of Lebanon after the Marine barracks bombing.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="harpoon"><B>Mk141 Harpoon Launchers</B></A><BR>
The ship carried eight Harpoon ship-to-ship missiles in canisters mounted just forward of and below the bridge.  The missile uses active radar for terminal guidance and has a range of 75 to 80 nautical miles.    <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="spg60d"><B>SPG-60D Radar</B></A><BR>
The SPG-60D radar provides gun-control data and permits Standard-MR missile tracking.  This radar is teamed with the SPQ-9A in the Mk86 Gun Fire Control System.    <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="spq9a"><B>SPQ-9A Radar</B></A><BR>
This radar, along with the SPG-60D, is part of the Mk86 Gun Fire Control System.  It provides surface search functions as well as weapons control.    <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="sps48"><B>SPS-48 Air Search Radar</B></A><BR>
The ship's main battery during CNOPS in the Caribbean.  The SPS-48 is a 3D radar (normally) used for air defense.    <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="ciws"><B>Phalanx Close in Weapons System</B></A><BR>
The CIWS is intended to defeat attacking anti-ship missiles.  It is a toally integrated system that includes search and trach radars, gun, magazine, weapon control unit and electronics.  The gun is a Gatling gun, adopted from the Air Force M61 Vulcan gun series.  It has a theoretical firing rate of 3000 rounds per minute.    <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="slq32"><B>SLQ-32 ECM</B></A><BR>
This is the heart of the ship's electronic counter measures.  It performs radar detection and jamming.   <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="sps40b"><B>SPS-40B Radar</B></A><BR>
The SPS-40B is a 2D air search radar capable of very long detection ranges.    <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="spg51d"><B>SPG-51D Missile Director</B></A><BR>
The SPG-51D is a tracking/illumination radar for the Standard missiles.    <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="mk32"><B>Mk32 Torpedo Launcher</B></A><BR>
One each port and starboard.  Uses compressed air to fire a Mk46 torpedo.  There are three tubes per launcher.    <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="gig"><B>Captain's Gig</B></A><BR>
As A Gang divo, this was one one the most important pieces of equipment on the ship; <B>THE</B> most important when in port at anchor.  No...I take that back, if UB1 and UB2 (utility boats, on the stbd davits) aren't working, the crew doesn't go on liberty; that spells trouble for all A-Gang people.     <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="mwb"><B>Motor Whale Boat</B></A><BR>
This little boat had the most troublesome engine of our four small boats.  It was mainly used as the ready life boat, and for utility work like fetching exercise toepedoes or investigating floating refrigerators.    <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="abl"><B>Tomahawk Armored Box Launchers</B></A><BR>
The ABLs were added in 1984, making Virginia the first "Strike Cruiser"  They replaced the leaky helo hanger in the stern.  Each ABL can hold four Tomahawks.  There were plans to add a Tomahawk missle magazine to these ships (utilizing the volume freed up by removing the hangar), but it was never implemented.  On Virginia, this space was used by the Engineering Department as a training area.<BR>
Two Tomahawk missiles were launched from the port ABL into Baghdad from the Eastern Med during the Gulf War.      <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="rhib"><B>Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat</B></A><BR>
A critical item to the ship's mission in it's last years.  Used to ferry Coast Guardsmen back and forth between suspect vessels for drug searches.  It was lowered to the water using an air operated winch suspended from a j-bar.  "Man the RHIB detail" was a common 1MC announcement during CNOPS, and usually indicated a boarding was imminent.    <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="elev"><B>Fwd Ammo Elevator</B></A><BR>
Another A-Divo headache.  On several sides of the elevator shaft were some very well air condidtioned spaces, which always caused a condensation problem.  And I don't think the sump pump down there EVER worked.   <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="1edg"><B>#1 Emergency Diesel Generator</B></A><BR>
This port is the exhaust for the forward of two 1000 kW emergency diesel generators.  Each of these units were driven a Fairbanks Morse 8 cylinder opposed piston diesel engine.  We ran them on JP-5, which was also used for in flight refueling (HIFR) of helocopters.  JP-% was also used for the diesels in the ship's four small boats.   <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="1ac"><B>#1 Air Conditioning and Machinery Room (1AC)</B></A><BR>
Garden spot of the Virginia.  This space housed the first of four 200 ton air conditioning units, two fire pumps, and the forward CHT tank.  I'm pretty sure this discharge here is from #1 AC seawater pump.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="2ac"><B>#2 Air Conditioning and Machinery Room (2AC)</B></A><BR>
2 AC housed the #2 and #3 AC units, two 3 ton refrigeration systems (for stores), #5 fire pump, and the Reboiler, which used steam from the engine room to produce ship's service steam.  (Contrary to common belief amongst the nucs, the Reboiler was NOT the cause of all chloride casualties.)  The discharge here is from #2 & 3 AC seawater pumps.    <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="rcvent"><B>RC Ventilation</B></A><BR>
These exhaust ducts are the outlet of the RC Ventilation system.    <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="bridge"><B>The Bridge</B></A><BR>
During the deactivation availability, I stood on the port bridge wing as the starboard side of the bridge was lifted off and set in the drydock.  This was quite a sureal experience after spending so many midnight watches on that bridge.    <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="sigbridge"><B>Signal Bridge</B></A><BR>
The Signalmen's hangout.    <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="ribbons"><B>Ship's Ribbons</B></A><BR>
(under construction.   I am looking for input as to all the ship's ribbons, I don't have a clear picture showing them all.)    <BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="bell"><B>Ship's Bell</B></A><BR>
The Ship's Bell was donated to the Navy League of Richmond, VA.  It is now displayed on the grounds of the Virginia Governor's Mansion.  <BR>
