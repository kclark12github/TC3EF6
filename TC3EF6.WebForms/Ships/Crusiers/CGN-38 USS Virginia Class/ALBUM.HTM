        <td>This one is of Coit Tower at the top of Telegraph
        Hill in San Francisco. I took it on a Sunday afternoon in
        May when Mark Kleinhenz and I went up to the city for
        some sightseeing (Mark's a buddy from the ship for you
        non-Virginia people out there). Mark was in town to
        attend some boondoggle in Monterey. I entered this
        picture in <a href="http://www.pixworks.com/">PictureWorks</a>
        monthly contest for May. Check out the site to see if I
        won. Picture Works makes the software that came with my
        camera. (196k GIF)</td>
