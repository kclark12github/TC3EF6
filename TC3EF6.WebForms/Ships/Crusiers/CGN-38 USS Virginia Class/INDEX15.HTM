        The following pages are a photo essay of how Virginia
        looked the day before being towed down the Elizabeth
        River to Norfolk Naval Shipyard for the deactivation
        availability. Soon after arriving at Drydock #4, the crew
        moved off the ship and the second deck became a
        ghosttown, tangled in a web of temporary services. More
        than one EDO/EDPO remarked at how he could hear voices
        when walking through the ship on tour, a very eerie
        feeling.<br>
