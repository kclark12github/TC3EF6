<p align="left"> Dear Lt. Huston,<br>
<br>
I was running arouond the World Wide Web yesterday and came
across a listing of ex-Navy folks and the ships they've served
on. When I noticed that you had been on the decomissioning crew
of the Virginia, I thought I'd drop you a line and chat a little.<br>
<br>
I had the privilege of serving on the pre-com and commissioning
crew of the Virginia from June 1975-August 1977. I was in
L-Division, and an MM2 at the time of commissioning, although I
made MM1 shortly after that. It's been quite a while since I dug
out the commissioning book and glanced through it, so I can't
remember the names of any save for my Division Officer, Lt. Keith
Bersticker and the Commanding Officer - Capt. George Washington
Davis IV (that's one you don't forget quickly!)<br>
<br>
Virginia was looked at as being a real &quot;show-boat&quot; in
those days: first in class, we had carpetting in the berthing
areas and suspended ceilings to block out the pipes and cableways
- a totally new concept at that time, and funded by outside
contributions from the state of Virginia as were a lot of other
decorative items on board. This ship's crest was designed by some
school kid, but I'll admit that I'm still pretty fond of it. I've
actually got an original crest patch still in the wrapper
somewhere. Would love to be able to get a ball cap, but have lost
hope since finding that the VA was taken out of commission a
while back.<br>
<br>
As I sit here in my office, I have a photo of the six California
and Virginia-class cruisers in formation, taken in 1981 (although
I was serving on the USS California at the time the photo was
made). It's about the only thing I have left besides my plank and
my plank-holder certificate and a lot of good memories.<br>
<br>
Without rambling on too much more, I'd love to chat a little
about our experiences if you'd care to. Drop me a line by e-mail
as you have time.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>

Hi Joel! Good to hear from you! I've just come back from my trip
down memory lane thanks to your website. I must say, I'm pretty
impressed with the time you took to do this and please accept my
sincere thanks. The layout and interactivity is great! Nice
photos, too. One of the best ship pages I've seen. I did add a
logbook entry. Was a little sorry not to see anyone from the
early days.<br>
<br>
Thanks for including the Captains' list. It was interested to see
that Ralph Lipfert captained the ship at the end. I served under
him when he was Engineering officer - although I can't honestly
remember if he was on the VA or the CA. The name rang a bell. The
first CO, Captain Davis, was easily the best officer I served
under during my 12-year career. He was the kind of CO who would
show up in #2ER during the midwatch just to sit and talk and ask
questions about how things were running and how we were doing
personally. Would even team up with the enilisted guys when we
played basketball. I would say that the general feeling among the
nukes went beyond respect to genuine affection for the man. I was
happy to hear that he had made Admiral later on - spotted it in a
dog-eared copy of proceedings I stumbled on.<br>
<br>
I was involved in all the shakedown cruises before and after
comissioning, and the first operational cruises in the Caribbean
- mostly out of Gitmo and Rosey Roads for exercises - but never
went across the pond on the VA. We did carry a nice sailboat and
a Cadillac Eldorado in the hanger bay down to some senior officer
in Gitmo on one cruise - during the days when we had an
operational accordian hanger door and elevator. As I remember, I
went through the first ORSE on VA, too. Can't recall what we got,
except we kept the keys. Rickover's visit was a real trip - he
presented an interesting figure, rather gnome-like and ghostly
drifting around the ER, climbing on things, firing questions at
the watchstanders with his USMC Colonel aide in tow.<br>
<br>
I went from the VA up to Ballston Spa where I taught Chem/Radcon
at the MARF (S7G) prototype from 1977-1980. Saw Rickover there
again - don;t think he remembered me from the VA. Then on to the
USS California for an IO cruise in 1981 (April 14 - November 22).
We were involved in escorting US-flagged ships out of the Red Sea
at the time Col Sadat was assassinated as president of Egypt.
Also kept an eye on the early goings-on between Iran and Iraq.
Rescued the crew from a burning Greek tanker off of India and
brought them ashore in Pakistan. Came back across the Pacific and
through the Panama Canal, making it an around-the-world passage.
I've got my Magellan certificate somewhere, too. Got out in
January 1983 with a selection to MMC in my hand but only more sea
duty to look at and three kids at home. It was time to call it
quits.<br>
<br>
Since the Navy, I've been serving as a full-time missionary
involved in international radio broadcasting - first from a
shortwave station on Guam and now at Trans World Radio's
international Headquarters in NC. I still travel a lot - mostly
to Europe, and will likely be going to India next year. Have been
at this for about 14 years now, but the Navy memories are still
fresh. I'd love to know some more about the decom days. Kind of
sad - makes me feel old that four of the five ships I served on
are in pieces now.<br>
<br>
Again, my sincere thanks for what you've done. It's nice to see
someone keeping the CGN38 afloat!<br>
<br>
By the way: the aft game room was called that because it had some
old arcade-type video game units (Space Invaders, I think) and
soda machines back there for a while.<br>

Dear Joel, <br>
I guess that older memories have a way of dimming the unpleasant
parts - I think the shrinks call it repressing or something like
that - but honestly, I can't remember much about my stay on the
Virginia that was really unpleasant - just normal watchstanding
and the usual shipyard hassles. My second son was born while I
was in precom duty - up at Riverside Hospital in Newport News. I
got a grand total of two days off for it - really magnanamous!<br>
<br>
I guess being on a brand-new ship with all the official visitors
and such made you feel special (if that's ever really possible in
the Navy) even though it sometimes seemed like a perpetual
personnel inspection. We got to be the host ship for a
bicentennial visit by a squadron of French ships to Norfolk back
in 1976. I spent the weekend being driver for a French Admiral -
same weekend I made MM1. The French ships looked pretty sharp
topside - but inside was another story - greasy, smelling of
garlic and poorly-lit. I got to meet the son of Charles DeGaulle
who was a senior French naval officer. Pretty neat!<br>
<br>
Since I spent a lot of my career in drydock (Forrestal -
Engineering refit; Will Rogers [SSBN659] - refuel, Poseidon
missle conversion; Virginia - precom; California - engineering
refit, phalanx &amp; harpoon upfit [twice in the yards]), the
yard life seemed pretty normal for me. I remember one time when
we were convinced that the yardbirds weren't doing much -
particularly where sweepdown (which they were responsible for)
was concerned. One of our ensigns got the bright idea of painting
a bottle cap red and pitching it on the deck. Sure enough - we
watched one less than energetic yard worker push a small pile of
dirt, including that same red bottle cap, round and round on the
diamond decking near main control in 2ER for his entire 8-hour
shift. It was good for a little self-righteous laughter until the
SY went out on strike for a couple of days and we got stuck
pushing bottle caps and other things around the ER. We began to
appreciate the SY worker's ingenuity after that.<br>
<br>
I appreciate your comments about being topside at night. I have
to say, that the primary redeeming factor about being at sea was
the chance to see God's creation in all its glory. I keep telling
people that you've never seen stars until you've seen them on a
moonless night in the middle of the ocean. When I read in some of
the old Horatio Hornblower books (a personal favorite) about the
phosphorescence of the water around the ship - my time in the
Caribbean on the VA comes to mind. One of the starkest memories I
have about seeing things at sea occurred when I was on the
California up near the entrance to the Persian Gulf back in 1981.
We had just had a major sandstorm blow about 100 miles out to sea
where we were - getting a brown grit into everything - especially
our bedding. I went topside at night and was treated to the site
of the moon looking blood-red, the water looking blood-red and
most of the stars looking red as well. The haze from the sand
storm was so fine that it created this incredible martian look to
everything. Wish I'd had a video camera back then. Could have
sold the footage to Spielberg for the next Star Wars movies.<br>
<br>
Please feel free to use any of my remembrances about the VA in
the web pages. I'll try to add some more as I dig through my junk
at home. I think I have a commissioning book somewhere. Don't
know if I could scan it in and send it to you, but I'll work on
it. Would have to do it at work, as I'm not equipped at home
(yet?).<br>
<br>
Thanks for the notes - nice to relive things - really!<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Bill<br>
