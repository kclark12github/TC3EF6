        <font size="2"> The budget axe claimed its latest victim
        Saturday when the USS Virginia, a Norfolk-based nuclear
        guided missile cruiser, was deactivated in a ceremony at
        Naval Station Norfolk.<br>
        Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Frank B. Kelso II, who
        will himself soon leave the Navy, was guest speaker and
        one of many military and civilian dignitaries attending
        the event.<br>
        The ship, with fewer years of naval service than many in
        attendance, looked perfect as it sat berthed alongside
        pier 11. And it was Kelso who perhaps best voiced the
        feelings of the large crowd that had faced bitterly cold
        winds to attend the ceremony.<br>
        &quot;Saying goodbye to any warship is always
        bittersweet. But if you viewed this ceremony from only a
        short distance away,&quot; said Kelso, &quot; you might
        think you were viewing a commissioning ceremony and not a
        deactivation.&quot;<br>
        Kelso's comment sounded much like one made by the man who
        introduced him, Adm Henry H. Mauz, commander-in-chief of
        the Atlantic Fleet.<br>
        &quot;I've been present at a lot of decommissionings, but
        they were of older ships - ships whose time it was to
        go,&quot; said Mauz. &quot;But there is alot of fight and
        life in this ship.&quot;<br>
        Kelso told the crowd that seeing young ships leave the
        fleet may be difficult, but with new missions and
        objectives, the Navy's needs are quite different than
        they were when Virginia joined the fleet during the
        height of the Cold War.<br>
        &quot;Some say they are victims of their own
        success,&quot; said Kelso, &quot;but I say they are
        victors of their own success. Virginia is retiring
        undefeated.&quot;<br>
        Michael Noble, a plankowner and Virginia's second
        Navigator, echoed Kelso's words when he told Soundings
        &quot;It's emotionally tough to see this.&quot; Now an
        investment consultant in Huntsville, Ala., Noble made the
        drive to Norfolk with his family for the weekend. In
        December, he chartered a helicopter to videotape the
        ship's last entry into port.<br>
        Commissioned as the first of four of its own class of
        heavily armed nuclear cruisers on September 11, 1976, the
        Virginia was due for nuclear refueling this year. In
        fact, its replacement core had already been bought and
        paid for. But faced with a shrinking budget and the move
        towards gas-turbine-powered Aegis system cruisers, the
        Navy chose to deactivate the ship. The USS Texas
        (CGN-39), the second ship in the class, was
        decommissioned last year.<br>
        During her active life, Virginia made nine deployments,
        including five to the Mediterranean, three to the
        Caribbean, and one to the Indian Ocean. She played a
        naval gunfire support role during conflicts in Beruit,
        Lebanon, and launched two Tomahawk missiles into northern
        Iraq during Operation Desert Storm.<br>
        The Virginia's most recent success was a three-month drug
        counterdiction cruise that ended last December. During
        the cruise, the ship helped confiscate more than 10,000
        pounds of cocaine and 41,200 pounds of marijuana. As
        further proof of her operational readiness, Virginia
        didn't suffer a single equipment casualty during the
        deployment.<br>
        The cruiser was towed to Norfolk Naval Shipyard Tuesday
        to begin the year-long defueling process. Because that
        process, which requires a long shipyard period,
        interferes with a traditional decommissioning ceremony,
        Saturday's deactivation ceremony served to commemorate
        the ship's departure from the operational fleet.
        Deactivation ceremonies are a relatively new tradition,
        started by nuclear submariners and usually limited to
        nuclear powered vessels.<br>
        Many of Virginia's crew will report to new commands
        during the coming year, while a small number will remain
        with the ship until preparations for actual
        decommissioning are completed.<br>
        Among those in attendance were many members of Virginia's
        original crew. The most visible of the
        &quot;plankowners&quot; was the current commanding
        officer, Capt. Ralph H. Lipfert.<br>
        Lipfert was the engineering officer under then-CO Capt.
        George W. Davis, Jr, when Virginia was commissioned.
        Davis, who attained flag rank before retiring, and the
        ship's four other former commanding officers were also in
        attendence.<br>
        After the ceremony, as most attendees scurried either for
        the warmth of the reception at the Breezy Point Officer's
        Club or for one last tour of the ship, one man stood out
        among the few left on the pier. It was Davis, Virginia's
        first skipper.<br>
        &quot;I'd like to say this is bittersweet,&quot; said
        Davis, &quot;but there's no sweetness involved.&quot;<br>
        Asked what his fondest memory of the ship was, he just
        smiled and said there were too many. Then he pointed at
        the Captain's Gig, specifically the shining brass
        propeller, and said, &quot;seeing that reminds me of
        one.&quot;<br>
        His smile grew a little broader. </font> </td>
