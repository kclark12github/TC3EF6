<p>Nice page. Good to see so many shipmates and get their EMAIL
addresses. After three years with all of you nukes, I am at NNSY
where the place is ate up with engineers and nukes. Somethings
never change, and Swanson is still Swanson. &quot;Open the pod

<p>I served on board VIRGINIA from Dec. '90 to Dec. '93. I had
incredible timing, in that I reported aboard the day before we
got underway for the Gulf War. A &quot;nuke&quot; both at heart
and in deed, I served in Engineering for my entire tour, serving
in the following billets (in chronological order): RL Divo, RC
Divo, Electrical Officer, and Asst. Engineer. Of course, my job
description would be INCOMPLETE without listing my most beloved
duty that I had for 16 months: ESO. Since leaving the VIRGINIA, I
had a very successful tour as the RADCON Officer on board USS
PUGET SOUND (AD-38) from 2/94 until 8/95. Interestingly enough, I
left VIRGINIA (CGN-38) just as she was going to inactivate for
decommissioning, and I left PUGET SOUND (AD-38) just as she was
decommissioning. I can only imagine my next ship would be FFG-38,
and I would take her into decom as well. As of 10/96, I am
serving at COMOPTEVFOR (Operational Test Evaluation Force), as a
Test Director for lightweight torpedoes and torpedo defense
systems.</b><br>

<p>Nice page there Joel! err... &quot;Mr. Huston&quot; I mean...
The PIG is indeed dead... but obviously not forgotten. If any of
you guys ever get a chance to be on a tow crew... DO IT! I helped
deliver the dead beast to Bremerton after DECOM and basically
kicked around doing NON-NUCLEAR stuff for almost a year before we
left. I have some videos of the tow if any of you are interested
(not for viewing by small children). Eight more months to go and
I'm out; it couldn't be soon enough. I hope everyone is doing
great; y'all take it easy. P.S. Don't go to the
&quot;IKE&quot;... it pretty much blows... ask Pete or Scratchy
(Heller)... I'm betting they would agree.</b><br>
