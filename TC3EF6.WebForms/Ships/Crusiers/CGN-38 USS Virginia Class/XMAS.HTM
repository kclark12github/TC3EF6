        <td colspan="2"> <font size="2">Virginia spent Christmas
        1991 at sea in the Caribbean. A few days before the 25th,
        the following was anonymously posted on the Wardroom
        bulletin board.</font><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        'Twas the night before Christmas,<br>
        when all through the ship,<br>
        the Skipper was nestled, enjoying the trip.<br>
        The XO was searching, making his trek,<br>
        checking the status of his second deck.<br>
        <br>
        Ops was a flailing, yelling like hell,<br>
        at all the OS's, advising &quot;ceasetell.&quot;<br>
        When up from below, the Cheng did appear,<br>
        asking the question &quot;Why are we here?&quot;<br>
        The question was answered by the wardroom with force,<br>
        stating emphatically &quot;We're here for your
        ORSE!&quot;<br>
        <br>
        CSO was there, somewhat confused,<br>
        screaming &quot;I'll help, if my radars are used!&quot;<br>
        EMO was laughing at Hal's little joke,<br>
        &quot;Your impotent radars are forever broke!&quot;<br>
        How can we track the waters and skies,<br>
        when all we have is our poor lookouts eyes?<br>
        <br>
        Then all of the sudden, the EWO came in.<br>
        To brighten the mood, he said with a grin,<br>
        &quot;Missiles on the rails, for drugs are the cause,<br>
        but let's not launch on Santa Claus.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Suppo was gleeful, he knew he'd survive,<br>
        for he was appointed Group Four One Five.<br>
        &quot;Send parts to the Conolly, the Downes needs stores.<br>
        If I do well this float, I'll get stationed ashore.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Chaps was a prayin', the movies could wait,<br>
        if you're payin' attention, you'll here him at eight.<br>
        <br>
        Let's not forget CICO, his jolly ol' self.<br>
        Dress him in red and he'd look like an elf.<br>
        With kindness and forethought, I just heard him pass,<br>
        &quot;Alfa Wiskey to Southrock, Get yo head out yo
        ass!&quot;<br>
        <br>
        The nubs in the plants have learned not to falter,<br>
        with the guidance and counsel of McGrath, Shares, and
        Walter.<br>
        To assist in their learning, books page-by-page,<br>
        are two prior enlisted named Reno and Gage.<br>
        <br>
        The ship will be safe, with the Hessions and the
        Hubbards.<br>
        Keep Squash off the Bridge and Tom from the cupboards.<br>
        Bill Johnson on boats with A gang on track,<br>
        his last PQS is &quot;making his rack&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        Mr Hartsel in Comm, and Jeff on the guns,<br>
        we'll shoot up antennas and talk to no one.<br>
        With Fish at the conn, Mr Green shooting stars,<br>
        we'll end up in Milwaukee, smashing parked cars.<br>
        <br>
        The DeGraws in the fleet, and his able trainee,<br>
        handle unreps and vertreps, as safe as can be.<br>
        Kevin's got the handle and Mark is OK,<br>
        Call Kevin first looey, don't call Mark &quot;O.J.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        All I've not mentioned, you know who you are,<br>
        your commitment and actions exceed all by far.<br>
        From Missiles and Deck, to the Galley and Stores,<br>
        you perform with distinction, we can't ask for more.<br>
        Keep up the spirit, the work and the play,<br>
        have a good evening and a good Christmas day.<br>
