<p>As you can see from browsing the strands of my little Web
site, my passion is aviation...in fact...it's been a very large
part of my life for many years. Feel free to look at the bottom
of this page for a few photos of me with various airplanes.<br>
<br>
There are, however, other important things in my life. Things
like my daughter, Courtney, my ex-wife, my work, etc.....<br>

<h3><a name="anchor876916"></a><i>A Short Biography</i></h3>

<p><br>
I was born in San Francisco and raised in the San Jose area where
I went to High School at Archbishop Mitty and college at De Anza
and San Jose State.<br>
<br>
I spent four years in the Air Force (again a symptom of my
addiction to flying) and learned all about electronics. What a
disappointment, in the four years I spent in the Air Force I
didn't get to fly in so much as a single Air Force aircraft.
Although I was all set to do the training to be able to take a
ride in an F-106 when they decided to close the base where I was
stationed and everything got canceled.<br>
<br>
So, you ask, what is my story? Read on!!<br>
<br>
As you may or may not have guessed from reading this page and
from the background, I'm GAY! I wasn't always proud of who I am,
quite the opposite and I tried very hard for a very long time to
be a &quot;straight&quot; man. Sorry honey, it ain't gonna
happen. <br>
<br>
I had a very strongly opinionated and socially though not
racially bigoted father ( I still loved him to death) and macho
male influences, not to mention the religious influences when I
was growing up. The simple fact of the matter is that I knew I
was gay by the time I was fourteen (so I use that as a time
reference). Try as hard as I might I couldn't loose or even
modify the feelings I had for other guys. I had a succession of
girl friends and I was even married for fifteen years.....but I
just couldn't deny who I am. It only took twenty-seven years but
I finally came out to myself. Once I came out to myself and
discovered that I wasn't some sick, perverted person, that
in-fact I am one helluva nice guy, I was able to be comfortable
with who I am. Soon after that I came out to my now ex-wife (who
by the way is still one of my best friends!) and just this last
summer (1996) I told my daughter. Courtney just looked at me as
if to say, SO?<br>
<br>
What do I like to do?<img

width="157" height="40" naturalsizeflag="0" align="MIDDLE"><br>
<br>
Fly (OBVIOUSLY), backpack, mountain bike, spend time with
Courtney , write (which I do for a living). I like to spend a
little time at the Billy DeFrank Center in San Jose. <br>

<h3><a name="anchor877966"></a><i>What Do I Want In Life?</i></h3>

<p><br>
To be happy, and to have my health, and to share my life with
someone special. Yes, I'm looking for that one special man with
whom I can spend the rest of my days. Neither one of is perfect,
we have our faults and we know it, but we love each other anyway,
maybe even because of those little flaws. One thing we make of
point of is reaffirming our love and COMMITMENT daily. We
sometimes argue but we &quot;never let the sun set on our
anger.&quot; We share our dreams and aspirations, and
disappointments. We rejoice together in our victories, and cry
together in our sorrows, always encouraging and drawing strength
from the other.<br>
<br>
We love to spend time outdoors, walking hand-in-hand along a
beach pausing to sit together and watch the warm golden orb of
the sun set slowly below the western horizon. We spend peaceful
weekends deep in a cool mountain wilderness or riding our
bicycles around town visiting little out of the way shops,
pausing for a cup of coffee or an iced tea at a curbside cafe
just off an almost unknown alley.<br>
<br>
An evening out to dinner and the theater are a special treat
topped off by cuddling on huge throw pillows in front of the
fireplace and making love for hours before falling asleep in each
others arms.<br>
<br>
Your day at work might be interrupted by a call from the front
desk, the receptionist says you have a delivery. Filled with
curiosity you enter the lobby and notice a strangely sweet
fragrance. Approaching the desk in the middle of the cathedral
like lobby you notice a large bouquet of roses, carnations, and
honeysuckle mounted atop the counter next to the receptionist.
You ask the receptionist for your package, she points to the
flowers and smiles. The card tucked neatly inside says simply
&quot;thinking of you my love.&quot; Later that evening, after
work and a light dinner, we spend a couple of hours running or at
the gym.<br>

<h3><a name="anchor886925"></a><i>What am I concerned about?</i></h3>

<p><br>
I suppose the biggest concern right now is gay rights, actually
it's more like basic HUMAN rights. Of course, HIV/AIDS and gay
youth. I wish I had the kind of support networks available to gay
youth today when I was young.<br>

<h3><a name="anchor894410"></a><i>Photos of Me with Various
Aircraft</i></h3>

<p><br>
<img src="../../crusiers/cgn-38%20uss%20virginia/Sean_C40.jpg"
width="432" height="251" align="BOTTOM" naturalsizeflag="3"><br>
Here is &quot;Captain Sean&quot; in front of his trusty
&quot;Mile-High Airlines&quot; steed. Actually its a twin engine,<br>
cabin-class, Cessna 401A aircraft. Yes, we really do give couples
&quot;Mile High&quot; rides in this<br>
beautiful airplane, complete with feather bed and big fluffy
throw pillows!<br>
<br>
<img src="../../crusiers/cgn-38%20uss%20virginia/Sean_C31.jpg"
width="286" height="288" align="BOTTOM" naturalsizeflag="3"><br>
This is me with the C310 &quot;Black Bird&quot;. It's the only
Cessna 310 of its kind. It's affectionately<br>
known all over the western United States as the &quot;Black
Bird&quot;. This is a real sweet airplane, fast,<br>
efficient, and a real attention getter at air shows and fly-ins.<br>
<br>
<img src="../../crusiers/cgn-38%20uss%20virginia/test_pil.jpg"
width="330" height="180" align="BOTTOM" naturalsizeflag="3"><br>
Here's &quot;Test Pilot&quot; Sean! I test fly experimental
aircraft for amateur builders who want the<br>
FAA to certify their aircraft. Sometimes it's pretty scary, but
it's always FUN!!<br>
