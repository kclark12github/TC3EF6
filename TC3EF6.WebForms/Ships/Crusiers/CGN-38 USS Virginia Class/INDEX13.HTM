        <td colspan="2"> <p align="LEFT">CGN 38 was the eighth
        ship to bear the name VIRGINIA. Of the seven previous
        ships, five were US Navy ships and two served the
        Confederate States Navy. Each of these ships has left her
        mark on history and a few helped change the course of
        naval warfare and the history of sea power.<br>

        alt="First USS Virginia" hspace="10" vspace="5"> The
        first USS VIRGINIA was one of the original thirteen
        frigates built for the Continental Navy. Her length from
        figurehead to taffrail was 148 feet and her beam was 34
        feet, four inches. She had 28 guns and her hull was
        coated with Pennsylvania fine crude oil mixed with pitch.
        She was ready for sea in 1777, but was captured by the
        British in 1778. She served in the Royal Navy for nearly
        ten years thereafter. <br>
        <br>
        The next USS VIRGINIA was a sailing vessel engaged in the
        service of the U. S. Revenue Service from 1798 until
        1801. The third USS VIRGINIA was a 74 gun ship of the
        line. She was ready for launch in 1821 and placed in
        reserve. The need for her service never arose and as a
        result she was broken up in September of 1884. <br>
        <br>
        Perhaps the most famous of all ships named VIRGINIA was
        originally the wooden-hulled steam frigate USS Merrimac.
        She was burned and scuttled in the Norfolk Navy Yard in
        1861 as Union troops attempted to destroy or burn all
        that could be used by the Confederate forces advancing
        through Virginia. <a name="back"></a> <img align="Left"

        hspace="10" vspace="5"> The Confederate Navy raised her
        up and she was rebuilt into an ironclad ram, commissioned
        CSS VIRGINIA (<a
        href="../../crusiers/cgn-38%20uss%20virginia/index13.htm#note">see
        Note 1 below</a>). In 1862, CSS VIRGINIA engaged the US
        frigates Congress and Cumberland blockading the
        Chesapeake at Hampton Roads. After inflicting a fearful
        slaughter on the gun crews of the Congress, the CSS
        VIRGINIA rammed the Cumberland, causing that ship to sink
        off of Point Comfort. CSS VIRGINIA retired up the James
        River for repairs, having received only minor damage
        during the engagement. On 9 March 1862, the Union
        Ironclad Monitor arrived in Hampton Roads. At 8 am, CSS
        VIRGINIA and USS Monitor engaged, thus opening a new era
        in naval warfare: The Era of the Ironclads. At noon,
        VIRGINIA disengaged and hauled off to Norfolk, ending the
        first battle between iron ships, with neither one winning
        a victory. CSS VIRGINIA was destoyed at Craney Island in
        May of 1862 to prevent her from falling into the hands of
        the advancing Union forces.<br>

        hspace="10" vspace="5"> The fifth ship named VIRGINIA was
        another Ironclad of the Confederate Navy, CSS VIRGINIA
        II. She saw limited action in the James River as a mobile
        gun platform for General Lee in defense of Richmond. She
        was destroyed by Confederate forces in April 1865, prior
        to the evacuation of Richmond. <br>
        <br>
        The sixth USS VIRGINIA was a captured Spanish blockade
        runner. She was renamed and outfitted for war. She
        cruised off the Carolinas in search of Confederate
        raiders until July 15, 1863. Later in the war, she joined
        the West Gulf Blokading Squadron at New Orleans. From the
        time of her capture until she was sold in November of
        1865, she captured or destroyed fourteen enemy vessels.<br>

        seventh ship named VIRGINIA was the battleship <a
        href="http://www.ualr.edu/~mdmorton/BB13.HTML">USS
        VIRGINIA (BB-13)</a>. She was launched under the
        sponsorship of Miss Gay Montague, daughter of the the
        Governor of Virginia, on April 5, 1904. In September and
        October of 1906, she was part of the fleet stationed off
        Havana, Cuba, ready to protect lives during the
        insurrection. On December 16, 1907, USS VIRGINIA was one
        of the sixteen great white battleships which passed in
        review before President Theodore Roosevelt as they set
        out on their famous world cruise. The circumnavigation of
        the globe led the Great White Fleet to many countries on
        their 48,000 mile goodwill mission. USS VIRGINIA later
        served the country throughout World War I and afterwards
        was used as a bombing target to display the effectiveness
        of aircraft against naval vessels. <br>

        This conversion took place in what is now Dry Dock #1 at
        Norfolk Naval Shipyard, the oldest drydock in North
        America and still in use today. The latest USS VIRGINIA
        was decommissioned in Dry Dock #4, about a two minute
        walk away. <a
