The crest of the USS Virginia was selected from almost 600
entries in a contest which challenged Virginia high school
students with the job of designing a suitable crest for this
mighty ship. Mr. Alan Brandtner of Kellam High School in Virginia
Beach designed the winning crest and received a $1000 scholarship
from the Navy League within the Commonwealth of Virginia.<br>
The crest is highly symbolic of the ship it so aptly represents.
The silhouette of the Commonwealth of Virginia represents the
state for which the ship is named. The missile represents the
main armament of the ship. The atom with orbiting electrons
symbolizes the nuclear propulsion plant, consisting of two
nuclear reactors. The shield in the center of the crest
represents the protection Virginia has provided the nation she
has served. Each of the eight stars represents a <a

named Virginia</a>. The motto &quot;Sic Semper Tyrannis&quot; is
the Virginia state motto and means &quot;Thus always to
tyrants.&quot;<br>
The heritage of the Virginia and our Navy are symbolized by the
ancient ship's wheel and rope, derived from earlier sailing ships
which constituted the first United States Navy. <br>
