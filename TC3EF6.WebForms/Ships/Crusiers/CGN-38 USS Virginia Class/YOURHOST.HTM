        So who would take the time to put together a site such as
        this, you ask?<br>
        My name is Joel Huston and I served as an officer in the
        Engineering Department from <table align="right"

            <tr>

        October 3rd, 1991 to the end, November 10th, 1994. I held
        positions as nub officer (five months), M-1 Division
        Officer (11 months), A Division Officer (12 months), and
        D.A.V.E. (8 months). If you need to know what D.A.V.E.
        stands for, drop me an <a
        href="mailto:huston@netgate.net">email</a>.<br>
        <br>
        Presently, I work for for <a
        href="http://www.appliedmaterials.com/">Applied Materials</a>
        in Santa Clara, CA. Applied is the world's largest maker
        of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and I'm glad to
        work there (even more so since I survived some recent
        layoffs). In my spare time I maintain this web site and
        help Mike and Carol Bleyle remodel the house they just
        bought in Fremont, CA.<br>
        <br>
        Why spend all the time to maintain this site? First, it's
        not alot of time (I'm single, so I suppose that's
        relative) and HTML is real easy. Second, I have good
        memories of my time on Virginia and I like to look back.
        One of my favorite memories is ORSE '93 (no, really):
        while doing the FRSU after a feed rupture, I looked over
        at throttleman's panel and saw all three TG vacuum gages
        going up in unison; what a great watch team, I thought.
        With the ORSE team CO in there, all I could do was break
        a little smile. Can't believe we got an average on that
        drill. Sure there were also some (very) bad times, but
        those memories have decayed away as fast as N-16 (sorry,
        couldn't resist a little nuc lingo there). I guess not
        standing duty for 2 years and getting to go home every
        night can do that.<br>
        <br>
        So anyway, I hope you enjoy the site. If you have any
        suggestions or comments, please drop me an email at <a
