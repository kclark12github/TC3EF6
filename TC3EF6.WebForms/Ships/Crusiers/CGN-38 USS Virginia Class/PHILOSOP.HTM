<p>The Existance of Mr. Right ( September 1996)</i> <br>
Mr. Right? He doesn't exist, that is, not an off-the-shelf,
match-made-in-heaven, version -- except for rare exception. <br>
<br>
Mr. Right doesn't just happen to come along, he's made. Each of
us has the opportunity to have Mr. Right in our lives. That which
is overlooked or simply unknown it that we become Mr. Right for
someone as he becomes Mr. Right for us. The following may seem
devoid of consideration of physical aesthetics or attraction,
however, that couldn't be farther from the truth. I want to
clearly acknowledge that meeting someone who is pleasant to look
at and to whom we feel an attraction is a major enhancement to
the process of making and becoming Mr. Right. After all, it is in
the male nature to be very visually stimulated. <br>
<br>
He begins as an ordinary guy, just another man off the street who
has something in common with us. Maybe we both like bicycling, or
flying, or running, some other activity, or hobby, or interest.
The beginning is friendship. For any structure to stand the test
of time and storm it needs a firm foundation laid upon solid
ground. In relationships the solid ground is friendship and
common experience. Friendship is largely a matter of choice, at
least at first. We find someone with one or two common interests
and form a loose alliance. A cup of coffee or lunch and we talk
about the things that are important in our lives, personal
histories, interests, etc.. Spend time with him, go on bicycle
rides, camping trips, bowling, running, movies - talk about the
things you have in common. Do the things friends do. Help each
other. Get to know each other. As the knowledge and common
experience accumulate, so will the caring. <br>
<br>
As time passes it will become obvious whether or not there is
something growing between the two of us. If it does, then the
time has arrived to make another conscious decision, to make
commitments or not. The foundation of a relationship is
commitment. Both partners, and that is exactly what one must be
for it to work, must make a real commitment to the relationship.
Commitments must be able to weather the storms that life brings;
unemployment, illness, the death of family or friends, arguments,
financial gain or loss, and the list continues. And so must the
commitment - NEVER GIVE UP! <br>
<br>
As time passes the thing one discovers is that through a
metamorphosis you have become Mr. Right to your partner, no one
knows him as well as you. No one can please him the way you can.
You care enough to make the little sacrifices, and many times
they don't seem like sacrifices at all, that he appreciates and
that say you care. You have, through your investment of time, and
energy, and emotion, grown attached to him. <br>
<br>
If he has been doing the same sorts of things, and he will have
had to for it to get this far along, the same is happening for
him. He has become Mr. Right to you. He knows you, and he
respects you, and is thoughtful of your needs. <br>
<br>
That brings me to qualities necessary for any Mr. Right. Honesty,
unselfishness, emotional openness, communication, and
self-esteem. <br>
<br>
One certainly needs to be honest. Honesty with your partner, and
yourself is a paramount virtue to be closely guarded. If the
trust is broken with a lie or a half-truth it is very difficult
to restore, that is why it is so very important to be perfectly
frank with each other. Secrets must not exist, they only lead to
the opportunity to lie to him about something when confronted. <br>
<br>
We need to be able to examine and place first the needs of our
partner, making him the focus of our attention, working for his
better good. Both partners doing so leads to a mutual
edification, or building-up. <br>
<br>
We must also be able to lay open our feelings for him to see, and
to touch, and to receive, and to experience. And in examining our
partner's emotions, we have the opportunity to show the
tenderness and compassion he needs to experience. This is the
kind of trust that goes so deep into the psyche as to have no
definition. <br>
<br>
Communication must happen, and it must be bi-directional, and it
must be genuine and constant. When one partner stops
communicating it implies mistrust and brings a sense of
helplessness to your partner. <br>
<br>
Self-esteem gives us the ability to weather both his and our own
depressions, and we all have them. We must have enough
self-esteem to realize that we have great worth and that we are
not the bad or worthless individuals some would have us believe.
Self-esteem also contributes to the inner strength necessary to
stay with our commitment in the difficult days. <br>
<br>
Very few individuals come to us with the innate ability to
understand what it is we are feeling, or to know what we are
thinking. How many people have the instant ability to trust
another with his most intimate thoughts? Time and experience and
mutual commitment and hard work are what make us into Mr. Right
for him, and he into Mr. Right for us. <br>
<br>
So - stop looking for Mr. Right and start looking for Mr. This Is
A Good Beginning!<br>

<h3><a name="anchor1294439"></a><i>True to Yourself - First</i></h3>

<p><br>
<br>
One must true to himself -- first. Only then can he be true to
and honest with those around him. <br>
<br>
We must be honest with ourselves about who we are acknowledging
that we were created an individual and that we are full of worth.
<br>
<br>
We must learn to love ourselves -- unconditionally. We must loves
ourselves and we must be completely in-love with ourselves before
we can love the world or truly be in-love with anyone else. <br>
<br>
If I cannot be true to myself, and loyal to myself, and love
myself, and honest with myself -- how can I be true, or loyal, or
honest, or love someone else. <br>
<br>
The sin, that's as good a word as any other, does not stem from
failing to be what we ourselves or someone else determines we
should be, but rather from ignoring who we are and pretending to
be something else. In my specific case the sin was not being gay,
it was being gay and pretending to be straight in the hope that I
would lose my homosexuality. <br>
<br>
I doesn't matter what the issue is -- sexuality, race, gender,
etc... The only thing that matters is that we are true to who we
were created to be and that we love ourselves so we can love
others and that we accept other people for who they are --
unconditionally and without reservation. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;This above all: to thine own self be true, <br>
    And it must follow, as the night the day, <br>
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.&quot; </p>

<h3><a name="anchor1312809"></a><i>What is Inside not Out</i></h3>

<p><br>
The true nature of a person is determined by his inner qualities.
The exterior is pleasant to look at, and fine to touch, and
exciting to play with -- for a short time. The external things
certainly hold an attraction but the physical is only a facade
and eventually deteriorates. <br>
<br>
A person's inner qualities are completely opposite to the
exterior in that they are less obvious and sometimes totally
unseen upon the first inspection, but become more visible and
grow in importance and influence as time passes. <br>
<br>
The personality, psyche, emotions, and depth of a person are what
bind and motivate us after the initial exterior impression
becomes old and fades. Liken this to a house with a fresh coat of
paint and new grass and a freshly planted garden to which we are
attracted and purchase for its esthetic qualities. As time passes
the paint fades, the lawn turns brown, and the flowers wilt and
are replace by weeds. In the time that we've spent with our house
we've grown to love it for the characteristics of it's interior.
The soft spot in the stairs, the way the morning light shines
into the kitchen, the sound of the furnace, and so on. Certainly
we can repaint and replant, but that has little effect on how our
home feels to us. <br>
<br>
The same is true in our relationships with people. We may be
attracted to how someone appears at first but the way they feel
(internally) to us as we grow to know them is the thing that
keeps us there because that is where we exist. <br>
<br>
As to what qualities I personally find of high value and
endearing there are a few, most of which are probably commonly
desirable and found in most of us. <br>
<br>
Love of Self - This may sound a little strange at first but when
I am done I think you will agree that this is a quality that is a
prime prerequisite. One must first be honest with themselves and
know that they are a unique individual, unlike any other. A
person must accept who they are, without reservation or regret,
for they are exactly what they were created to be and there is no
shame or disgrace in that. <br>
<br>
One must be not only comfortable and accepting of themselves, but
love themselves and be in-love with themselves before they can
truly love another. <br>
<br>
Honesty - This is related to self love, and is actually a
prerequisite to it. One must be totally, even brutally, honest
with himself so that he can expose and examine who he really is.
One must also acknowledge and admit to his faults, quirks, and
eccentricities. The so called faults and so forth are not
necessarily bad, quite the opposite in most people for they are
the things that largely make us the person we are. <br>
<br>
One must be honest with himself before he can be honest with
anyone else. A person must develop the ability to see and say the
truth, and posses the wisdom to know when to speak and when to
remain silent for a time. <br>
<br>
Openness -- To be truly a part of another there must exist a
mutual sharing of the deepest kind between the two. That sharing
is by definition most intimate and sensitive and private. If it
we are not totally open with our partner we cannot share our soul
with him. When there is a lack of access to our partner there is
resentment and a natural suspicion. <br>
<br>
Openness leads to ultimate trust. The kind of trust that can
exist no where else and that is absolute and unquestioned. It is
an integral part of the axiom &quot;I love you with all my heart,
and all my mind, and all my body, and there is nothing in the
universe that can change that.&quot; <br>
<br>
Sincerity -- One must be totally free of deception and ulterior
motives. What you say to me and I to you must be exactly what we
mean. Sometimes we overstate the fact, or state a higher degree
of fact than actually exists, that is human. But that does not
imply that we do not mean what we say if it is said in honesty
and with the belief that it is true. <br>
<br>
Humor -- The ability to laugh, especially at yourself, is
evidence that you are comfortable with those around you and most
importantly that you are comfortable with yourself. Humor lifts
the spirit and gladdens the heart and gives a unique flavor to
the lives of all whom it touches. <br>
<br>
Gentleness -- So much of the time we must harden ourselves to the
blows that life inflicts upon us, keeping a strong hand on the
tillers of our lives so that we may maintain the course we have
set for ourselves. We are said to &quot;have our act
together&quot; when we display this trait, however the pitfall is
that we become hardened and harsh. <br>
<br>
One must learn to remove the armor of our daily lives so as to
expose ourselves to our close friends, families, and our mate. We
must also learn to be tender in how we touch the ones we love,
both physically and emotionally. <br>
<br>
When we lay open our soul our heart is exposed, and that too
easily bruised and broken so that it must be held with a velvet
glove. <br>
<br>
Compromise -- Because no matter how close we are to another, no
matter how much a part of him we become, we are all individuals.
We must learn the art of compromise, finding a mutually
acceptable common ground upon the issues which set us apart. <br>
<br>
Without compromise we will eventually fall into a state of war,
and with a state of war destroy much if not all we have built
together. <br>
<br>
Forgiveness -- Because we are human we sometimes offend and are
often offended by another, particularly the ones to whom we are
closest. Forgiveness is the means to cleanse the way between us,
the tool with which to remove the barrier, and the water with
which we quench the fires of our anger. <br>
<br>
A passage from The Bible describes the practical use of
forgiveness, &quot;Let not the sun set upon your anger&quot;. If
we forgive before we go to bed then when morning comes all is
fresh again and no anger remains. <br>
<br>
These things constitute the inner you, which is the most
beautiful part of all. <br>
