<p>Yes indeed, a new level of geekdom has been achieved. When
will you teach me HTML? Nice scan of the ship - where did you do
it? </p>

<p> PS: It's &quot;the cat and me&quot; - and no, Carol didn't
have to tell me that. </p>

<p>You're right, you are a geek. <br>
I'll never have a web site. <br>
A little grammar note: It should say &quot;Here's a picture of my
cat and me.&quot; <br>
By the way, Anne says you don't have enough to do. </p>

<p>. . . Yes I do have other e-mail address's but they have asked
to remain unlisted, you know how us ELT's are. But feel free to
put mine on your page. Excellent picture by the way. I wondered
where the pig ended up. Yes I do work for Sandia Labs, I have
been in the Health Physics department here for three years. </p>
