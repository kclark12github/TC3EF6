        <td colspan="2"> <p align="LEFT">Built in Virginia by
        Virginians, USS VIRGINIA was constructed at Newport News
        Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. Her sponsor was
        Virginia Stuart Warner, daughter of then Secretary of the
        Navy and now senior US Senator from Virginia. The ship
        was commissioned on 11 September 1976 in a ceremony at
        Norfolk Naval Base. <img align="Right"

        width="293" height="371" hspace="10" vspace="5">After the
        extensive trials and shakedown associated with the first
        ship of a new class, she entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard
        for Post shakedown availability. This was the start of a
        lifetime association between ship and yard for depot
        level repairs and modifications. After normal workups,
        including a trip to Northern Europe as a part a major
        NATO exercise, she made the first of nine deployments. As
        part of an Indian Ocean deployment in 1980, she crossed
        the Indian Ocean to visit the Republic of the
        Philippines. During her third Mediterranean deployment in
        1983, she fired nearly 300 five inch rounds into Beirut
        and assisted when the Marine barracks were bombed. She
        was honored as Sixth Fleet Top Hand for that deployment.
        In 1984, she entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for her
        single major overhaul and was converted to the Navy's
        first strike cruiser with the addition of the Tomahawk
        weapons system and the SM-2 extension of her surface to
        air capability.<br>
        On 28 December 1990, VIRGINIA deployed to support
        Operation Desert Shield and later Desert Storm. Just
        after arrival in the Eastern Mediterranean, she launched
        two Tomahawks into Iraq in support of the liberation of
        Kuwait. For the last two years of active service,
        VIRGINIA joined in the war against drugs. During her
        Caribbean deployment in the fall of 1992, she passed
        through the Panama Canal and operated in the Pacific for
        a short time. In the course of her last deployment in the
        fall of 1993, she directly detected or controlled other
        Navy assets during successful interdictions of 36,200
        pounds of marijuana and 2,000 kilos of cocaine.<br>
        In the course of her lifetime, many flag officers called
        VIRGINIA home while embarked at sea. The first was
        Admiral H. G. Rickover, who embarked during sea trials in
        July 1976. The last was Admiral Donald Dyer,
        COMSTANAVFORLANT in March 1993. She won the Battle E
        competition four times during her lifetime as the best
        nuclear cruiser on the East Coast and has won countless
        department awards.</p>
