<P><B>SHIELD: </B>The three divisions of the shield represent the three
circumnavigations of the earth made by the first vessel to bear the name
VINCENNES, and contain allusions to activities of these expeditions. The
intended fess line represents the ice of the Antarctic continent which
was discovered and named by LT Charles Wilkes of VINCENNES in 1840. The
Antarctic wastes and icebergs are alluded to by the white area in center
base which bears a lead line weight of the early 19th Century period, referring
to the new data in charts and cartography gathered by the surveys made
during expeditions with VINCENNES as flagship. The silver fleur-de-lis
in chief refers to the French origin of the name VINCENNES and the fort
in Indiana after which the ships were named.</P>

<P>The eight gold stars on a light blue border represent the Battle Stars
awarded to CA-44 and CL-64 during World War II and refer again to the State
of Indiana, whose flag bears gold stars on a blue field. Then Navy is represented
on the shield by dark blue and gold, colors usually associated with the
Navy.</P>

<P><B>CREST: </B>The embattled wall recalls the Fort Vincennes in Indiana.
Its color, red, refers to battle, and the three battlements to the three
earlier vessels named VINCENNES. The compass rose represents global navigation
and exploration. The clover is a reference to the new ship's distinction
as third of its class, and recalls the botanical surveys of the first VINCENNES.
The guided missile and rifle represent new and old weaponry carried by
the latest and the first VINCENNES. The blue disc is a reference to the
Antarctic skies and the first VINCENNES' explorations</P>
