<P>VINCENNES is the fourth capital warship to bear this name and a city
in Indiana, 55 miles south of Terra Haute. The city is the site of the
old Fort Vincennes, captured during the American Revolution in 1779 by
George Rogers Clark. The first VINCENNES was one of ten Sloops-of-War to
be authorized by Congress in 1825. For 41 years, she compiled an outstanding
record of unprecedented achievements in polar exploration, global circumnavigation
and distinguished service in the War Between the States. The second VINCENNES,
designated (CA 44), was a heavy cruiser commissioned in 1937. She fought
valiantly during General Jimmy Doolittle's raid on Tokyo, the Battle Midway,
the landing at Guadalcanal, and finally, at the Battle of Savo Island.
The third VINCENNES (CL 64) was commissioned in January 1944 and fought
brilliantly throughout the Pacific in Battles of Guam, the Philippines,
Okinawa, and Formosa. During the closing months of World War II, VINCENNES
became legendary for her successes against Japanese aircraft.</P>
