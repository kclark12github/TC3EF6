<p><a
href="../../crusiers/cgn-37%20uss%20south%20carolina/CGN37P.GIF">SOUTH
CAROLINA</a> is a CALIFORNIA Class cruiser with an overall length
of 596 feet, and an extreme beam of 61 feet, one-half inch. Her
full displacement is approximately 12,000 tons, with a maximum
draft of 30 feet, 5 inches. The ship has a top speed in excess of
thirty knots. The power to accomplish this is provided by two
fission reactors, which power geared-turbines to a set of twin,
fixed-pitch screws. This type of propulsion gives her the added
high speed, endurance, and staying power vital to a modern Navy. </p>

<p>SOUTH CAROLINA's mission is to operate independently, or in
company with strike, anti-submarine or amphibious forces, against
possible air, submarine, and surface threats. SOUTH CAROLINA is
equipped with the New Threat Upgrade Integrated Combat System
which incorporates the power of two Standard Missile Medium-Range
Missile Systems (one forward and one aft), two 5-inch/54-caliber
lightweight guns, Anti-Submarine Rockets (ASROCs) and torpedoes,
the Phalanx Close-In-Weapons System (CIWS), and the Harpoon
Surface-to-Surface Missile System. </p>

<p>Maintaining SOUTH CAROLINA in an action-ready posture is the
job of the 42 officers and 550 enlisted men, who comprise the
crew. This is the fifth United States Navy ship to bear the name
SOUTH CAROLINA, and these men are continuing to write her
history. </p>
