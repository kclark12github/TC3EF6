<p><center> OFFICIAL CREST </center> </p>

<p>The circular shield on <a href="../../crusiers/cgn-37%20uss%20south%20carolina/CGN37P.GIF">SOUTH
CAROLINA's</a> crest depicts the ship's never- ending vigilance
and continuity of service to her Navy and country. Below the
shield, written in Navy Blue and Gold, is the motto of the State
of South Carolina: &quot;Prepared in Mind and Resources.&quot; </p>

<p>A bright red outline of the state, superimposed over a gold
anchor, represents the ship, which is surrounded by the blue
waters over which it reigns. In the right hand portion of the
state outline is the symbol of the atom, power source of the
ship. The five gold stars spaced across the shield are a reminder
that CGN 37 is the fifth ship to bear the name SOUTH CAROLINA.
Finally, the overall color scheme of red, white, and blue
represents the flag of the nation which SOUTH CAROLINA so proudly
serves. </p>
