<U><B>USS SHILOH (CG 67) CREST</B></U><B>:</B> 
<P>
<B>Shield : </B>Blue and Gold are the traditional Navy's colors.
Red denotes courage, sacrifice, and the blood shed at the epic
battle of Shiloh. White represents high ideals and optimism. The
anchor symbolizes sea power, while the cross on the stock refers
to Shiloh Church and the Civil War battle for which CG-67 is named.
The red compass rose, simulating a burst, symbolizes the concentrated
and intense fighting in the &quot;Hornet's Nest&quot; at Shiloh.
The compass rose also represents the multi-faceted mission of
the USS SHILOH. The red and white wavy bars commemorate &quot;Bloody
Pond&quot; and the valor displayed during the battle. The wavy
bars also refer to the sea and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.
<P>
<B>Crest : </B>The arrowhead, divided into blue and gray, together
with the Union and Confederate flags recalls the Civil War. The
arrowhead also suggests the vertical launch capabilities of the
Aegis Cruiser. The splintered peach tree symbolizes the aftermath
of the Battle of Shiloh. The peach trees, in bloom at Shiloh during
the battle, stood in stark contrast to the destruction and violence
of the fight which pitted brother against brother.
<P>
<B>Supporters: </B>The Civil War weapons, the musket and cannon,
reflect the close conflict on the field of Shiloh. It was the
greatest battle ever fought on the American continent, up to that
date.
