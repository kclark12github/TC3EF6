HAWAII (CB-3) was launched 3 November 1945 by New York Shipbuilding 
Corp., Camden, N.J.; sponsored by Mrs. Joseph R. 
Farrington, wife of the delegate from the Territory of Hawaii.  One of the 
projected class of six battle cruiser type ships, of which only two were 
completed, HAWAII and her sisters were designed to cope with the large 
German "pocket battleships" and Japanese armored cruisers.  Due to the 
reduction in defense expenditures after World War II, her construction was 
suspended.  In September 1947 she stood 84 percent complete.  For a time it 
was planned that HAWAII should be converted to the Navy's first guided 
missile ship, but she remained in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.  Her 
classification was changed to large command ship, CBC-1, 26 February 1952 
when conversion was again contemplated; but she reverted to her original 
classification 9 October 1954 and was sold for scrap to Boston Metals Co., 
Baltimore, Md., in 1959 after being struck from the Navy List 9 June 1958.
