<p><b>SHIELD:</b> </p>

<p>Dark blue and gold are the colors traditionally associated with the
Navy. Gold is emblematic of excellence and red denotes valor and sacrifice.
The red wedge and the trident symbolize DDG 59's modern warfare capabilities:
the Aegis and Vertical Launch Systems. The three tines represent submarine,
surface and air warfare. The wedge superimposed on the valve alludes to
Major General Russell's leadership and vision in the development of the
Fleet Marine Force and amphibious doctrine. The two gauntlets symbolize
the two Russells and highlight teamwork and cooperation. The wavy divisions
of the shield represent a river and underscore Rear Admiral Russell's service
in coastal and river campaigns during the Mexican War and Civil War. The
sun and light blue reflect the tropical climate of the Gulf Coast and Caribbean,
referring to both Russell's service in the Gulf of Mexico and, especially,
Major General Russell's extended service in Haiti. The sun and light blue
also highlight the south and west Pacific service of the first USS RUSSELL
(DD 414) in World War II. </p>

<p><b>CREST:</b> </p>

<p>The sixteen-sided shield and star commemorate the first USS RUSSELL's
sixteen battle stars during World War II. The gold star also denotes command
and authority. The stylized Oriental dragon symbolizes strength, vigilance
and service in the Orient and Pacific. </p>

<p><b>SUPPORTERS:</b> </p>

<p>The crossed naval officer sword and Mameluke signify the special relationship
between the Navy and Marine Corps in projecting power from the sea. The
unique character of naval service is embodied in the Russell family where
two distinguished officers, father and son, served their respective services
and their country with honor on the land and sea. </p>

<p><b>MOTTO:</b> </p>

<p>&quot;STRENGTH IN FREEDOM.&quot; The real strength of our country is
that, for over 200 years, Americans have fought and died for the ideals
of freedom and democracy. Hence, &quot;Strength in Freedom.&quot; </p>
