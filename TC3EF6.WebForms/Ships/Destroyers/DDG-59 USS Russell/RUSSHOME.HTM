<p><b>MISSION OF USS RUSSELL:</b> </p>

<p>USS RUSSELL is the ninth ship in the ARLEIGH BURKE-class of destroyers.
RUSSELL is designed to conduct simultaneous operations against land, air,
surface, and subsurface targets. The ship possesses the AEGIS Weapon System
and the AN/SPY-1D multifunction radar for the simultaneous detection and
tracking of hundreds of potential targets. Ninety missiles are stored for
rapid firing in the vertical launching system (VLS). RUSSELL is also outfitted
with a potent anti-submarine warfare system with both hull mounted and
towed array sonars. The Harpoon anti-ship cruise missile system and Tomahawk
land attack cruise missile allow RUSSELL to neutralize surface threats
as well as support combat forces ashore. </p>

<p>RUSSELL can conduct prompt, sustained combat operations from the sea
either independently, or in support of carrier battle groups or amphibious
ready groups, protecting these ships from attack and projecting power ashore.
She can defend against coordinated attacks by enemy surface ships, submarines,
aircraft, and missiles... and win! </p>
