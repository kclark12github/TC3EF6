<p>         Dark blue and gold represent the sea and excellence, and are
         the colors traditionally associated with the Navy, thus
         highlighting Chaplain Laboon's dedicated Naval service.  The
         color white suggests integrity and purity of purpose.  The
         quartered shield suggests a cross reflecting the Chaplain's
         mission.  The upright trident symbolizes sea prowess, and
         highlights the ship's vertical launch capabilities, with the
         three tines representing anti-submarine, surface and air
         warfare.  The trident, with its bottom spike pointing to the
         ocean depths, also represents Chaplain Laboon's service as a
         submariner, both as a line officer and a chaplain.

                    <p><center> CREST </center>
<p>         The life preserver symbolizes Chaplain Laboon's heroic rescue
         of a downed fighter pilot from the sea, while under enemy
         fire.  The preserver's straps are red, reflecting courage and
         sacrifice, and denotes his services with the Marines in
         Vietnam.  The star commemorates the Chaplain's Silver Star
         award, and also represents his five successful submarine
         combat patrols.  The wreath of laurel is emblematic of honor
         and accomplishment.
