<B>LABOON PARTICIPATES IN RUGGED NAUTILUS 96</B>
<P>By LTJG S. E. SPRATT, USNR

<P>     United States Ship LABOON (DDG 58) is currently forward
deployed to the Arabian Gulf and is an active participant in
Exercise "Rugged Nautilus 96". Rugged Nautilus is a joint,
short-notice deployment exercise conducted by United States
Central Command's (USCENTCOM) Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine
Corps components deployed to the Arabian Gulf.  The exercise
takes place from the first of July to the 30th of August 1996,
and is designed to test USCENTCOM's ability to rapidly gather and
organize forces in theater, establish a command and control
element to execute air, ground and naval surface operations, and
then exercise and evaluate those operations.
<P>     Rugged Nautilus will include training across the spectrum
for all units involved.  This training will include areas such as
dissimilar aircraft operations; air defense operations;
amphibious operations; naval surface operations; logistics;
command, control and communications; and intelligence collection
and dissemination.
<P>     LABOON is only one element of the many participants.  Also
involved is the USS CARL VINSON Battle Group, USS TARAWA
Amphibious Ready Group and Marine Expeditionary Unit (ARG/MEU),
Air Force Expeditionary Force (AEF III) Qatar, Electronic
Communication Squadron Davis Mountain AFB, AZ, and elements of
the USCENTCOM Headquarters, USNAVCENT Headquarters and U. S.
Fifth Fleet.  All together, some 13,000 service men and women
will participate in the exercise.  Close coordination with the
governments of Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar will ensure that Rugged
Nautilus 96 will be a complete success and provide invaluable
training for all involved.
<P>     LABOON will also be responsible for fulfilling her primary
missions as a forward deployed ready strike platform and the
enforcement of United Nations sanctions through Maritime
Interception Operations (MIO) while participating in Rugged
Nautilus.  Although very busy, LABOON sailors will benefit
greatly from the experience gained during Rugged Nautilus, and
look forward to putting their professional skills to the test!

<P><B>LABOON REACHES MIDDLE OF MAIDEN DEPLOYMENT</B>
<P>By LTJG S. E. SPRATT, USNR

<P>     LABOON left her homeport of Norfolk, VA. in the late
afternoon of 03 May, 1996 to begin her maiden deployment. 
Enroute to participate in MEF 2-96, LABOON met with USS DOYLE
(FFG 39) and USS PLATTE (AO 186) off  the coast of Cape Hatteras. 
Throughout the trans atlantic voyage LABOON, DOYLE and PLATTE
conducted exercises designed to sharpen skills that would be
needed at their final destination.  The exercises focused on
warfare area coordination, but also included such things as
emergency break away procedures for underway replenishment,
visual signal drills, and practice boardings by each ship's
Visit, Board, Search and Seizure (VBSS) Teams.
<P>     Upon entering the Strait of Gibraltar, the three ships split
up and continued on to seperate ports of call.  LABOON transited
through the Mediterranean Sea and anchored in Corfu, Greece for
several days of welcome liberty.
<P>     After departing Corfu, LABOON and DOYLE (enroute from
Malaga, Spain) transited the Suez Canal on 21-22 June, 1996 and
entered the Red Sea.  LABOON and DOYLE next stopped for fuel in
Djibouti on 27 May.
<P>     LABOON next participated in international cooperation
exercises with the French Navy and Air Force.  The exercises,
called PASEX, reinforced the close coordination and cooperation
necessary when conducting air warfare, surface warfare,
electronic warfare, basic seamanship and shiphandling.  LABOON,
DOYLE, FS COMMANDANT BORY (F 726), and two F-1 Mirage aircraft
participated in the exercises conducted off the coast of Djibouti
in the Gulf of Aden.
<P>    LABOON and DOYLE passed through the Strait of Hormuz in the
early morning hours of 1 June 1996 and shortly thereafter entered
the Aarabian Gulf.  LABOON's mission as an element of Middle East
Force, United States Fifth Fleet and United States Central
Command is twofold.  First and foremost LABOON serves as a
forward deployed and readily available strike platform in support
of United States foreign policy.  While operating in the Arabian
Gulf, LABOON and her crew are ready to respond to contingency
operations and to demonstrate United States' resolve and
commitment to the stability of this region of the world.
<P>     LABOON's secondary mission is to serve as an enforcement
agent for United Nations Security Council sanctions against the
government of Iraq by conducting Maritime Interception Operations
(MIO). LABOON does this by aggressively patrolling specified
areas of the Arabian Gulf and maintaining surveillance upon all
suspect maritime traffic within them.  Those vessels suspected of
being sanctions violators, or enroute to specified ports of call,
are queried and may be boarded by LABOON's VBSS Teams.  The VBSS
Teams inspect all cargo and related documents to ensure that the
vessels are conducting legitimate trade and are not violating any
of the United Nations sanctions.
<P>     While on station in the Northern Arabian Gulf performing MIO
operations LABOON conducted an exchange of personnel with the
Australian frigate HMAS MELBOURNE (FFG 5).  In the early morning
of 15 June, MELBOURNE's helo landed on LABOON with five
Australian sailors.  LABOON then sent five of her crew back to
MELBOURNE.  The exchange lasted 24 hours, and both ships had the
opportunity to show off, discuss differences and similarities in
operations, procedures and quality of life issues.
<P>     Commodore David M. Stone, Commander, Middle East Force and
Destroyer Squadron Fifty Embarked LABOON on 04 June 1996.  While
embarked, Commodore Stone and his battle staff maintained a clear
picture of all naval operations on going in the Arabian Gulf.
<P>    Commodore Stone further honored LABOON by choosing to
conduct his change of command ceremony underway in LABOON. 
Commodore Stone was relieved by CAPT Joseph F. Herger on 27 July,
1996.  CAPT Stone will report to and relieve as Chief of Staff to
Commander, United States Sixth Fleet.  In a farewell message sent
to LABOON (COMIDEASTFOR MSG DTG 261145ZJUL96), Commodore Stone
stated "Without a doubt USS LABOON is the finest warship I have
observed during my 21 months on station in the Arabian Gulf.  It
was indeed a pleasure to have embarked in this great ship".
<P>     LABOON is currently an active participant in Exercise Rugged
Nautilus 96.  Rugged Nautilus is a joint, short notice deployment
exercise conducted by the United States Central Command's
(USCENTCOM) Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps components
deployed to the Arabian Gulf.  The exercise began on the first of
July and will end on the 30th of August 1996.  
<P>    The exercise is designed to test USCENTCOM's ability to
rapidly gather and organize forces in theater establish a command
and control element to execute air, ground and naval surface
operations, and then exercise and evaluate these operations. 
LABOON is also currently underway patrolling the Arabian Gulf and
conducting MIO operations.

<P><B>TIP OF THE SPEAR</B>
<P>By LTJG S. E. SPRATT, USNR

<P>     United States Ship LABOON (DDG 58) left her homeport of
Norfolk, Virginia on her maiden overseas deployment on the third
of May, 1996.  LABOON spent about four weeks enroute to her final
destination, the Arabian Gulf.  With a brief stop in Corfu,
Greece, LABOON entered the Strait of Hormuz and began her most
important mission yet. 
<P>     LABOON's mission as an element of Destroyer Squadron Fifty,
Fifth Fleet, United States Central Forces Command, is twofold. 
First and foremost is to serve as a forward deployed and readily
available strike platform in support of United States foreign
policy.  Through her operations in the Arabian Gulf, LABOON and
her crew are ready to respond to contingency operations and to
demonstrate the United States' resolve and commitment to
stability in this very volatile region of the world.  
<P>     LABOON's secondary mission is to serve as an enforcement
agent of United Nations Security Council sanctions against the
government of Iraq by conducting Maritime Interdiction Operations
(MIO).  LABOON does this by aggressively patrolling specified
areas of the Arabian Gulf and maintaining surveillance upon all
maritime traffic within them.  Those vessels thought to be
suspect or enroute to specified ports of call are queried and
boarded by LABOON's Visit, Board, Search and Seizure Teams
(VBSS).  The VBSS teams inspect all cargo and related documents
to ensure that the vessels are conducting legitimate trade and
are not violating any of the UN sanctions.
<P>     Those vessels found to be attempting to violate the UN
sanctions are detained in designated holding areas until they can
be diverted to a neutral port.  To date, LABOON has queried well
over 30 vessels, boarded some 15 vessels of all descriptions, and
diverted two because of illegal cargos.  These numbers will
surely increase in the months to come as LABOON continues to
aggressively perform her assigned duties forward deployed at the
"Tip of the Spear" in the Arabian Gulf.

<P>
<B>THERE YESTERDAY, HERE TODAY...AND GONE TOMORROW!</B> 
<P>
Although PSA seems long ago, deployment feels almost too close!
LABOON departed the BIW facility in Portland, Maine on 12 December.
This signaled the completion of the arduous (and extremely cold)
Post Shipyard Availability period. Since then, the focus has been
on making the necessary preparations for LABOON's virgin deployment.
And of course, LABOON has been constantly on the move. 
<P>
LABOON got underway for COMPTUEX on 20 February. This was our
first time operating with a full carrier battle group. The entire
first week was spent sailing to the Puerto Rican Operational Area
with several other ships practicing Anti Submarine Warfare. 
<P>
LABOON's return to the United States took her to Annapolis, Maryland
and the United States Naval Academy for a five day public relations
visit. While in Annapolis, LABOON crew members had the opportunity
to tour the Academy and downtown Annapolis. Many also took advantage
of the close proximity to visit Washington D.C. and Baltimore
(many also returned home to Norfolk). Overall, it was a good visit,
but all were happy to return home to Norfolk. 
<P>
The trip to Norfolk gave LABOON an opportunity for a family cruise,
and many family members took advantage of it! 
<P>
The morning after our return to Norfolk, we were again underway.
This time to the Naval Deperming Facility. Although not a long
trip (about a half an hour), it seemed far away. The facility
is accessible only by boat, and sits offshore Fort Norfolk. The
process to deperm and calibrate LABOON's degaussing system (a
system used to prevent detonation of magnetically triggered mines)
was a long one, with all hands pitching in to get the messy job
of wrapping and unwrapping the ship with heavy electrical cables
accomplished.
<P>
 LABOON then returned to pier 10, berth 5 of the Norfolk Naval
Station. Finally home for a little while, the ship commences a
Pre Overseas Movement (POM) period. POM commences on 5 April and
will secure on 29 April. This period allows the crew to take leave
and spend some personal time with their families before leaving
on deployment. POM is also the last opportunity for the ship to
take on needed supplies and make arrangements before leaving.
<P>
<B>LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT A WINNER FOR LABOON!</B> 
<P>
LABOON's Supply Department performed superbly during its first
Logistics Management Assessment (LMA). LMA is a rigorous inspection
of all areas of supply management including general stores, food
service, retail operations and the planned maintenance system
(PMS). The examination was conducted by the Readiness Support
Group (RSG) Norfolk during the first week of April. LABOON's overall
evaluation was excellent, with scores of 95% or better in all
four of the major functional areas. These scores exceed all required
prestigious &quot;BLUE E&quot;, which is awarded to ships who
have demonstrated excellence in supply management. The inspectors
stated that in many ways LABOON was the best ship they have seen
in the past year. The outstanding results from the LMA prove that
the level of customer service and logistics are second to none.
LABOON'S success is the culmination of weeks of preparation by
the Storekeepers, Mess Specialists and Ship's Servicemen. Congratulations!
<P>
<B>LABOON FAMILIES BRIEFED ON UPCOMING DEPLOYMENT</B> 
<P>
The last in a series of three special pre-deployment briefings
was conducted aboard LABOON on 3 April. All three briefs were
presented by the Navy Family Services Center, and were directed
towards single, married, and crew members with children respectively.
The information presented at these briefs was invaluable not only
to those crew members who are making their first deployment, but
also to those who have not deployed in several years. 
<P>
The briefs covered such topics as services available through the
Navy Legal Services Office, various support groups, Navy Family
Services Center, local Navy Medical facilities and MWR. Also discussed
were financial considerations, pre-deployment planning, strategies
for handling the long separation from loved ones, correspondence
ideas, and ways for the children why one of their parents will
be away for a long time. 
<P>
<B>HAVE YOU MET LABOON'S OMBUDSMAN YET? WELL, WHY NOT?</B> 
<P>
 Cindy, is LABOON's
Ombudsman. For those of you who may be new to the Navy, an Ombudsman
is a command designated point of contact for spouses, children,
parents, girlfriends, etc. of all crew, CPO's and Officers. She
has the latest information on where the ship is and what it is
doing. She also organizes family activities and events to bring
LABOON's extended family together while the ship is away from
homeport. 
<P>
