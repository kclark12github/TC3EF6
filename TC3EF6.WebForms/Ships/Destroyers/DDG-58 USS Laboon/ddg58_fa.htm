<P><center> SHIP'S NAMESAKE </center>

<center> JOHN FRANCIS LABOON, JR., S.J. </center>
<center> CAPTAIN, CHAPLAIN CORPS, U.S. NAVY </center>
<center> (1921-1988) </center>

<P>    This ship honors the distinguished Naval career of
<A HREF="DDG58NS.GIF">Captain "Jake" Laboon</A>.

<P>    In the words of Cardinal John O'Connor, Father Jake was "a man who
treated a seaman as respectfully as he treated an admiral."  He
constantly worked to improve living conditions, and address the needs
of officers, enlisted personnel, and their families.  "Everyone was
sacred in his eyes - a person of priceless worth."

<P>    Born in Pittsburgh on 11 April 1921, Father Jake attended Carnegie
Technical Institute for one year after high school.  In 1949, he
entered the Naval Academy, where he excelled in both athletics and
academics.  In 1942, he was a member of the All-East Football Team, and
in 1943, "jumped ship" to Lacrosse, where he was selected for the
Intercollegiate National Championship Navy Lacrosse Team, defenseman
on the All-American Lacrosse Squad, and participated in the North-South
All-Star game.  He also served as President of the Newman Club, a
Catholic support group.

<P>    After accelerated graduation in 1943, he trained as a submarine
officer in New London, Connecticut, and upon completion, was assigned
to USS PETO (SS 267).  During his tour, Father Laboon served as
Communications Officer, Gunnery and Torpedo Officer, and Executive
Officer.  Surviving numerous war patrols in the Western Pacific,
Lieutenant Junior Grade laboon was awarded the Silver Star for his
heroic actions on PETO's tenth war patrol.

<P>    The actions for which Father Jake was awarded the Silver Star, are
indeed extraordinary.  Following pick-up of a downed American pilot
near the Island of Honshu, the crew was searching for his "wingman."
The second aviator was soon spotted, but the water was shallow and most
certainly mined, preventing the PETO from maneuvering closer.  To make
matters worse, they were under intense enemy fire from a Japanese shore
battery.  The Commander called for a volunteer, and without hesitation,
LTJG Laboon dove off the sub.  Swimming throughout the mined waters,
he rescued the pilot.  This unselfish act underscored Father Jake's
character, and set the tone for how he lived his life...an inspiration,
a true hero.

<P>    Lieutenant Laboon resigned from Naval service shortly after the end
of World War II, and entered the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) on
31 October 1946.  On 17 July 1956, Father Jake was ordained a Jesuit
Priest at Woodstock, Maryland.

<P>    Father Jake then applied for a commission in the U.S. Naval Reserve
Chaplain Corps in February 1957, and in September 1958 was recalled to
active duty.  Over the course of the next 22 years, Father Jake served
in various duty stations around the world, including Alaska, Hawaii,
Japan, and Vietnam.  While in Vietnam, he was awarded the Legion of
Merit with Combat "V" for his fearless actions as battlefield Chaplain
with the 3rd Marine Division in April 1969.

<P>    Other notable milestones in a truly distinguished career, include
the honor of nomination for promotion to the rank of Admiral, and
service as Chief of Chaplains.  The Polaris Submarine Program was also
blessed with having Father Jake as its first chaplain.  The U.S. Naval
Academy was likewise honored with his service as Senior Catholic
Chaplain.  On 31 October 1980, Captain Laboon retired as Fleet
Chaplain, U.S. Atlantic Fleet.

<P>    After retirement from the Navy, Father Laboon returned to Annapolis
to oversee the construction of a Jesuit-retreat facility, Manresa-on-
Severn, which was within view of the U.S. Naval Academy he so loved.
His final assignment was pastor of St. Alphonsus Rodriquez Church in
Woodstock, Maryland.  He served faithfully until his death on 1 August
1988, exactly 28 years after his beloved PETO was struck from the Navy
list of commissioned ships.

<P>    Throughout a lifetime of service to God and country, Father Jake
was an extraordinary example of dedication to Sailors and Marines
everywhere.  His genuine interest and concern for all his shipmates
made him the most widely known and respected Roman Catholic Chaplain
in the U.S. Fleet.  Father Jake's fearless nature, compassion, and
determined sense of pride will be reflected in the officers and crew
of the ship which bears his name, the USS LABOON (DDG 58).

<P><center> LAUNCHING LABOON </center>

<P>    On a typically cold Maine morning, 20 February 1993, the "Fearless
58" was launched at Bath Iron Works.  LABOON, which honors Father John
F. "Jake" Laboon, is one of only seven ships in the 216 year history
of the Navy to be named for a Chaplain.  She is the eighth ship of the
prestigious ARLEIGH BURKE Class destroyers, among the most survivable
and formidable ships every put to sea.

<P>    The launching of a ship is a time-honored ceremony, and third in
a series of milestones that bring a ship to life.  Prior to the
launching, Laboon family and friends took part in the "wedge driving"
ceremony, which took place in the early morning hours of the launch.
Tradition dictates that wedges must be driven twelve hours before the
launch to prepare the ship for its descent into the Kennebec River at
high tide.  Later that morning, the ship was christened by her
sponsors, Father Jake's three sisters:  Sister de Lellis, Sister
Rosemary, and Sister Joan Laboon, all Sisters of Mercy.  As is 
custom, a champagne bottle was used to knock LABOON
off the skids and into the Kennebec River, where she got her first
taste of waters she would soon so diligently keep free.

<P>    The principal speaker for this happy occasion was Father Jake's
longtime friend and former shipmate, Cardinal John O'Connor, Archbishop
of New York.  Expressing his deep friendship and admiration for a
"truly great naval officer," Cardinal O'Connor said:  "Father Jake was
both Mr. Navy and Mr. Church.  He treated a seaman as respectfully as
he treated an admiral.  He saw in every person the image and likeness
of God, and treated everyone accordingly."

<P>    The invocation was given by Father Jake's brother, Father Joseph
Laboon, a Veterans Administration Chaplain.  Other in attendance
included the Honorable Sean O'Keefe, Secretary of the Navy, Admiral
Frank Kelso, Chief of Naval Operations, and numerous other Admirals,
VIPs, and friends of Father Jake.

<P>    Cardinal O'Connor closed the ceremony, invoking our namesake's
blessing, "...may you of LABOON be assured that if Father Jake has the
influence in Heaven that he had in the Navy, you will always be blessed
with fair winds and following seas."

<P><center> SHIP'S SPONSORS </center>

<P>    LABOON has <A HREF="DDG58SP.GIF">three sponsors</A>, each Sisters of Mercy, and also sisters
of Reverend John F. "Jake" Laboon.  Sister de Lellis Laboon, Sister
Rosemary Laboon, and Sister Joan Laboon performed the christening of
LABOON on 20 February 1993.

<P>    Sister de Lellis Laboon, R.S.M., earned degrees in Home Economics

maintains good order and discipline in LABOON.  ADMIN is led by the
Executive officer.

<P>    PERSONNEL.  The Personnelmen (PNs) are responsible for the updating
of crew member's service records.  These service records include
official documents, such as qualification sheets, evaluation reports,
and list of awards received.  Each record stays with that service
member for his or her entire Navy career, and therefore must be
extremely accurate, especially when a member transfers.  The PNs also
assist in ensuring all crew members are paid the correct amount on
time.

<P>    ADMINISTRATIVE.  The Yeomen (YNs) handle all official
correspondence, publications, and documents for the Command.  Each
publication and item of correspondence must be serialized by ADMIN by
subject matter, using Standard Subject Identification Codes (SSICs).
Additionally, the YNs are responsible for maintaining officer service
records, ensuring entries are current and complete.

<P>    CAREER COUNSELING.  LABOON maintains at least one Navy Counselor
(NC) on board as a resource to crew members.  The NC can assist crew
members in applying for numerous programs offered by the Navy.
Finally, the NC ensures that all reenlistment requests are accurate and
acted upon to support crew members' reenlistment wishes.

<P>    MASTER-AT-ARMS.  The Master-At-Arms (MAs) ensure that good order
and discipline is kept by LABOON crew members, both on and off the
ship.  MAs continuously inspect the ship for cleanliness and safety.
Additionally, MAs handle the preparation of all discipline reports, and
assist the Legal Officer in conducting both judicial and nonjudicial
punishment procedures.  The MA Force is made up of at least one rated
MA, and other crew members who volunteer for the Master-At-Arms Force.

<P>    MEDICAL.  LABOON maintains at least one Hospital Corpsman (HM) on
board to support the crew with medical treatment, and to provide quick
response in case of an emergency.

<P><center> COMBAT SYSTEM DEPARTMENT </center>

<P>    LABOON's sophisticated combat system is designed to support brief,
intense engagements, in which the full simultaneous operational
capability of the ship, including maximum firepower of all weapons,
will be employed to support national policy.  LABOON will operate as
an element of a coordinated force, or independently as the nucleus of
a Surface Action Group (SAG), to conduct an/or coordinate operations
in numerous warfare mission areas, including:  Anti-Air Warfare (AAW),
Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), and Strike
Warfare (STW).  Combat System Department is led by the Combat System
Officer and the Weapons Officer, and consists of 5 divisions.

<P>    CA DIVISION.  The SONAR Technicians (STs) and Torpedomen (TMs) are
responsible for the AN/SQQ-89 Integrated ASW Suite, the most advanced
ASW system in the world today.  The AN/SQR-19 Tactical Towed Array
SONAR (TACTAS) provides very long-range passive detection of enemy
submarines, while the AN/SQS-53C Hull-Mounted SONAR is used actively
and passively to detect and localize submarine contacts.  LABOON also
has the capability to launch and recover SH-60B LAMPS MK III
Helicopters, which can communicate with LABOON to localize and attack
submarines, and to conduct Over-The-Horizon Targeting (OTH-T) missions.
LABOON can attack hostile submarine contacts, using torpedoes fired
from her six MK 32 Surface Vessel Torpedo Tubes (SVTT) or, for contacts
at greater ranges, Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rockets (ASROC) (VLA)
fired from the MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS).

<P>    CE DIVISION.  The Electronics Technicians (ETs) and Interior
Communications Electricians (ICs) operate and maintain LABOON's
electronic support systems.  Primary responsibilities include the
operational readiness, calibration and casualty control of the Exterior
Communications System (EXCOM), Interior Communication System (ICOM),
Navigation System (NAV), Surface Search Radar System (SSRS), and
electronic equipment not specifically assigned to another division.
The ETs ensure all radiating sensors and communication equipment are
operational for safe navigation, and communication with other units.
The ICs are responsible for the Interior Voice Communication System
(IVCS), which is a complex system of telephone lines and multi-user
nets used for internal communications, and shipboard command and
control.

<P>    CF DIVISION.  The Fire Control Technicians (FCs) are responsible
for the AEGIS Weapon System, which is the most sophisticated and
complex weapon system in the world.  At the heart of the AEGIS System
is LABOON's primary air and surface sensor, the AN/SPY-1D Phased Array
Radar.  This radar incorporates significant advances in the detection
capabilities of the AEGIS Weapon System, particularly in its resistance
to the enemy Electronic Countermeasures (ECM).  Using the AN/SPY-1D,
and the ship's MK 99 Fire Control System, LABOON can guide its
vertically-launched surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles
(SM-2) to intercept hostile aircraft and surface combatants at extended
ranges.  Additionally, FCs are responsible for LABOON's Harpoon and
Tomahawk surface-to-surface cruise missile weapons systems to support
ASUW and STW missions.

<P>    CO DIVISION.  The Gunners Mates (GMGs and GMMs) and FCs in Ordnance
Division are responsible for all the safekeeping and transportation of
almost all ammunition on board LABOON, and most of the weaponry used
to fire the ammunition.  The MK 41 Vertical Launching System is an
integrated magazine and launcher which can stow and launch up to 90
SM-2, VLA and Tomahawk missiles.  The MK 45 5"/54 Caliber Gun Mount,
in conjunction with the MK 34 Gun Weapon System (GWS), is used against
surface ship and close hostile aircraft, and support forces ashore with
Naval Gunfire Support (NGFS).  Finally, LABOON's two Phalanx Close-In
Weapons Systems (CIWS) provide point defense against hostile air
targets.

<P>    CS DIVISION.  The System Test Officer and Combat System Maintenance
Manager coordinate the testing, maintenance and operational
demonstration of the entire combat system.  This coordination often
involves personnel from all departments, to ensure that LABOON can meet
any challenge she is presented.

<P><center> ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT </center>

<P>    LABOON's Engineering Department consists of seventy-five
technicians distributed throughout four divisions.  The primary
responsibilities of Engineering Department are to safely and

and Gas Turbine Systems Electrical Technicians (GSEs) are primarily
responsible for main propulsion and electrical power generation.  The
GSMs maintain four LM-2500 Gas Turbine Engines, and all associated
equipment, in two Main Engine Rooms, necessary to provide and control
propulsion.  The GSEs are tasked with the upkeep of three Allison
501-K34 Gas Turbine Generators, capable of providing 2,500 Kilowatts
each.  Additionally, Main Propulsion Division is accountable for the
storage and quality of the lubricating oil used throughout the
engineering plant, and the fuel oil burned by the engines and
helicopters.

<P>    R DIVISION.  Repair Division is primarily responsible for training
the ship's crew in proper fire-fighting, flooding, and other casualty
response techniques.  Every person in LABOON must first be a fire-
fighter.  The eighteen-person team, led by the Damage Control
Assistant, provides general and specific training to everyone in the
ship, so that all 325 crew members know their responsibilities during
a casualty.  Additionally, Damage Controlmen (DCs) are responsible for
the upkeep of LABOON's sophisticated repair equipment.  Finally, the
Damage Controlmen lead the way by serving as the team leaders for all
shipboard emergency response teams.

<P><center> OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT </center>

<P>    Operations Department is comprised of four divisions, and is the
largest department in LABOON, with 6 officers and over 100 enlisted
personnel.  The department's principle role is to support LABOON in
sustained operations at sea as a part of a Joint Task Group or as an
independent unit in Anti-Air, Anti-Surface, Anti-Submarine and Strike
Warfare operations against the enemy.  Secondary roles include fixed
and rotary-wing aircraft control, electronic and celestial navigation,
electronic and visual communication, refueling and replenishment at
sea, Naval Gunfire Support, Electronic Warfare, Search and Rescue and
small boat operations.

<P>    Operations Department is led by the Operations Officer (OPS), who
oversees all Division Officers and their respective divisions in the
performance of their duties.  OPS is also responsible for the
evaluation and dissemination of combat and operational information
required for LABOON to fulfill its assigned mission.  Other duties
include serving as Command Training Officer, Command Safety Officer,
and Primary Security Assistant.

<P>    OC DIVISION.  OC Division consists of Radiomen (RMs), and is
responsible for all electronic communication in LABOON, including the
receipt, transmission, and internal distribution of all electronic
messages.  The duties of OC Division include managing and handling
sensitive material, which allows LABOON to use secure ship-to-ship and
ship-to-shore transmissions, and the operation of all radio equipment.
The Communications Officer leads OC Division in the performance of its
duties.

<P>    OD DIVISION.  OD Division is comprised of Boatswain's Mates (BMs)
and non-designated seamen.  They are responsible for the safe execution
of all deck evolutions, which include anchoring, mooring, underway
replenishment, and small boat operations.  OD Division also is
responsible for the preservation and painting of LABOON, and flight
deck operations.  The First Lieutenant leads OD Division in the
performance of their duties.

<P>    OI DIVISION.  OI Division consists of Operations Specialists (OSs),
Electronic Warfare Technicians (EWs), and Intelligence Specialists
(ISs).  This division is responsible for the collection and
dissemination of all combat information required for LABOON to assess
the tactical situation, and successfully employ the unique combat
capabilities of the complex warship.  Other duties include the
operation of the AEGIS Combat System.  EWs manage the electronic
spectrum so LABOON can achieve the tactical advantage.  The Combat
Information Center Officer leads OI Division in the performance of its
duties.

<P>    ON DIVISION.  ON Division consists of Quartermasters (QMs) and
Signalmen (SMs), and is responsible for the safe navigation in LABOON,
and visual communications.  QMs use all visual, celestial, and
electronic means to determine or "fix" LABOON's position in the world.
SMs are experts in visual communications, allowing LABOON to
communicate with other ships in sight, without using electronic means,
which can be detected by the enemy.  The Navigator leads ON Division
in the performance of its duties.

<P><center> SUPPLY DEPARTMENT </center>

<P>    Supply Department is split into five divisions, which work together
to provide the crew of LABOON with everything from repair parts to
meals.  Supply Department is led by the Supply Officer, who ensures
parts, consumable items and "hotel" services are provided to the crew.

<P>    S-1 DIVISION.  Stores Division could best be described as the local
version of a hardware store, repair parts warehouse, and convenience
store, all rolled into one.  The Storekeepers assigned to S-1, are
responsible for providing material support to the entire ship.  Their
scope of responsibilities range from clerical support, to ensure the
"Administrative Machine" runs smoothly, to procuring and stocking
repair parts in order to maintain LABOON's hull, mechanical and
electrical mission readiness.  Supply Support Center is located two
decks below the Crew's Mess, amidships.

<P>    S-2 DIVISION.  The Food Service Division in LABOON is staffed by
15 Mess Management Specialists of various rank and time in service.
The purpose of the General Mess is to provide U.S. Navy enlisted
personnel with wholesome, nutritional meals.  This is achieved through
proper food preparation and service based on the Basic Daily Food
Allowance (BDFA), which is promulgated by the Navy Ration Law.  The
General Mess is located on the main deck, amidships.  They serve
approximately 325 personnel three meals a day.  The galley is manned
24 hours a day, seven days a week, to ensure that quality meals are
produced piping hot, fresh, and on time for each crew meal.  This in
turn greatly enhances the moral of the crew.

<P>    S-3 DIVISION.  Sales and Services Division in LABOON is staffed by
a team of Ship's Servicemen (SHs) dedicated to customer service.  This
division includes the Barber Shop, Laundry, Ship's Store and Vending
Machines, and, therefore, is inextricably linked to the moral of the
ship.  If it needs to be bought, cut, or washed, the SHs are the
professionals that get the job done.

<P>    S-4 DIVISION.  LABOON's version of your local bank is the
Disbursing Office, staffed by Disbursing Clerks (DKs).  Any issue
dealing with money is handled by these very capable professionals.  Pay
issues, travel and per diem payments, advance pay - the list of tasks
performed by Disbursing goes on and on.  Safekeeping of items of
significant intrinsic value is provided on a strictly space-available
basis.  LABOON even has an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) for Sailor's
convenience.

<P>    S-5 DIVISION.  The Wardroom Mess is another area for LABOON's
hospitality experts.  The Mess Management Specialists (MSs) assigned
to work in the Wardroom, are responsible for feeding LABOON's 25
officers.  These hearty meals are served by the Food Service Attendants
in a fine dining atmosphere.  They are also responsible for the
maintenance and upkeep of the staterooms on the ship.  MSs on board
LABOON take great pride in their work, and strive for excellence as
they provide fine gourmet cuisine to LABOON's officers and crew.

<P><center> LABOON WORKS FOR A CLEANER ENVIRONMENT </center>

<P>    Although our county is not without environmental problems, we
Americans reap substantial benefits from our system of environmental
protection.  The Navy is a major player in this system.  Working
cooperatively with environmental authorities and interest groups at the
national, regional and local levels, we are making significant
contributions in environmental technology development, oil spill
preparedness, natural resource conservation, and many other areas.

<P>    To improve the upkeep of our environment, the Navy is primarily
concerned with two environmental problems.  The first of these issues
deals with ozone depletion substance elimination.  Halon,
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and other ozone-depleting substances are
extensively used throughout the Navy and the nation for fire-fighting,
refrigeration and other applications.  Under international law, the
production of Halon has already been terminated, and other ozone-
depleting substances are being phased-out worldwide.  The Navy is
actively working to develop substitutes, but we do not have all of the
answers yet.  The Defense Logistics Agency has a plan in place to
stockpile ozone-depleting substances for mission-critical requirements
unless current usage rates are substantially reduced.  To avoid a
mission-threatening crisis down the road, we are working to reduce or
eliminate leakage from air conditioning and refrigeration equipment
throughout the Navy.

<P>    The second issue which concerns LABOON and the Navy is general
shipboard environmental protection.  Congress has already established
deadlines outlining the prohibition of plastic discharges by Navy ships
at sea.  This plastic problem will be resolved with the installation
of plastic processors on every ship by 1998.  Congress has also set
guidelines for the discharge of food waste into designated areas.  Over
the next several years, we will be working hard to find a long-term
solution to the designated area problem.  In the meantime, many Navy
ships, including LABOON, have already substantially reduced garbage
discharges at sea through ambitious retention programs that go beyond
legal requirements.  Additionally, the Navy is currently working with
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Coast Guard on a
legislative proposal to establish uniform national discharge standards
for liquid discharges from Navy ships.  If this initiative is
successful, these standards will ultimately replace varying state
standards.  We would then be able to design, train and operate
according to a single environmental nationwide standard.

<P>    LABOON's goal is to keep America clean, and we are striving to do
that through the strict enforcement of these new standards, while
continuously pursuing a better way to handle all environmental
concerns.  We expect environmental protection programs to become
increasingly important in the future.  LABOON and the Navy are moving,
and will continue to move, in the right direction to keep the
environment clean.
