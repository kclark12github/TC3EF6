<P>    The mission of <A HREF="DDG58P.GIF">LABOON</A> is to be prepared to conduct prompt,
sustained combat operations at sea, in support of national policy.  She
is equipped to operate in a high-density, multi-threat environment as
an integral member of a carrier battle group or Surface Action Group
(SAG).  In addition to her own self-defense capabilities in Anti-Air
Warfare (AAW), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), and Anti-Surface Warfare
(ASUW), LABOON can effectively provide local area protection to the
battle group, SAG, and other ships.

<P>    LABOON is equipped with the world's most sophisticated weapon
system.  She has an AN/SPY-1D Phased Array Radar, which incorporates
significant advances in the detection capabilities of the AEGIS Weapon
System, particularly in its resistance to enemy Electronic Counter-
measures (ECM).  Using the SPY-1D and her Mark 99 Fire Control System,
LABOON can guide her vertically-launched Standard Missiles to intercept
hostile aircraft and missiles at extended ranges.  To provide point
defense against hostile air targets, LABOON is equipped with the Block
1 upgrade to the Phalanx Close-In Weapons System (CIWS).

<P>    LABOON is also equipped with the Navy's latest ASUW Combat Systems.
Long-range, anti-ship and land attack cruise missile capability is
provided by Tomahawk Missiles, which are launched from her Mark 41
Vertical Launching System (VLS).  Her shorter range Harpoon Anti-Ship
Cruise Missiles have a range in excess of 65 nautical miles.  The 5"/54
Caliber Gun, in conjunction with the Mark 34 Gun Weapon System, is an
anti-ship weapon which can also be used for close air contacts, or to
support forces ashore with Naval Gunfire Support (NGFS).

<P>    Finally, LABOON's AN/SQQ-89 integrated ASW Suite is the most
advanced anti-submarine warfare system in the world today.  The
AN/SQR-19 Tactical Towed Array SONAR (TACTAS) provides extremely long-
range passive detection of enemy submarines, and the AN/SQS-53C Hull-
Mounted SONAR is used to actively and passively detect and localize
submarine contacts.  LABOON also has the capability to land a SH-60B
LAMPS Mark III helicopter, which can link to the ship for support in
anti-submarine operations, as well as conduct over-the-horizon
targeting missions.

<P>    These systems are supplemented by the AN/SLQ-32V(2) Electronic
Warfare Suite, which includes passive detection systems and decoy
countermeasures.

<P>    Powered by four quick-response General Electric LM-2500 Gas Turbine
Engines coupled to two Controllable, Reversible Pitch (CRP) Propellers,
LABOON has tremendous maneuverability, and a top speed in excess of 30
knots.  Her expert engineers also provide the ship with fresh water,
and heating and air conditioning facilities.

<P>    Home to a crew of over 330 men and women, LABOON has most services
associated with a small town at sea, including dining, banking, ATM,
laundry and shopping facilities, over 10,000 line items of spare parts,
and a barber shop.  A marvel of modern technology and engineering,
LABOON is a powerful instrument of peace in the service of her nation,
capable of sustaining herself at sea for months at a time.
