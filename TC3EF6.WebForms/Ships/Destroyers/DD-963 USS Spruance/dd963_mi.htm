<P><CENTER> SPRUANCE CLASS DESTROYERS </CENTER>

<P><A HREF="DD963P.GIF">SPRUANCE</A> is the first of a class of 31 destroyers developed for the
primary mission of anti-submarine warfare, including operations as an
integral part of attack carrier forces.  These multi-purpose combatants
are also capable of providing naval gunfire support in conjunction with
Marine amphibious operations worldwide.  Utilizing highly developed
weapons systems, SPRUANCE is designed to hunt down and destroy high
speed submarines in all weather, but can also engage ships, aircraft,
and shore targets.

<P>With her two five-inch/54-caliber MK 45 gun mounts, MK 41 Vertical
Launch System (VLS) (Tomahawk/ASROC), Harpoon Missile System, MK 32
Torpedo Launchers, NATO Sea Sparrow Missile System, and an embarked
LAMPS MK III Helicopter Detachment, SPRUANCE is capable of maintaining
American's strength on the oceans of the world.  SPRUANCE IS 563 feet,
4 inches long, with a beam of 55 feet, and displaces 9,000 tons.  Her
crew consists of 21 officers and 308 enlisted.  An embarked Helicopter
Detachment adds an additional 5 officers and 15 enlisted.  The keel was
laid 27 November 1972.  SPRUANCE was launched 10 November 1973 and was
commissioned 20 September 1975.

<P><CENTER> CHARACTERISTICS </CENTER>

<P>ANTI-SUBMARINE.  The equipment on board SPRUANCE enables detection of
submarines at considerable ranges.  The Sound Navigation and Ranging
(SONAR) transmits a sound wave, which is reflected by the submarine to
allow range and bearing assessment.

<P>When the position of the submarine has been determined, either by the
ship or the ship's SH-60B Helicopter, computers will pass the necessary
information to Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC) Missile System and the
helicopter.  An attack can be conducted with the ASROC (rocket-thrown
torpedo).  Once the ASROC is fired, at a predetermined time, the
missile releases a homing torpedo which hunts down the submarine until
it is destroyed.  An attack can be conducted using the ASROC or a
torpedo launched from the ship's torpedo launchers.

<P>SPRUANCE can stream a decoy from the stern to divert torpedoes fired
at the ship.  Another device, an expendable bathythermograph (XBT)
measures the sea's temperature at varying depths and indicates how
SONAR waves are bent by layers of warmer and colder water.

<P>ANTI-SURFACE.  SPRUANCE is the first destroyer to be back-fitted with
MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) which is capable of firing the
Tomahawk Cruise Missile.  This system enables SPRUANCE to engage shore-
based, and naval surface targets at long range.  The Harpoon Missile
System is proven effective in engaging shipping at intermediate ranges. 
The five-inch/54-caliber gun represents a major step forward in medium-
caliber ordnance for the U.S. Navy.  The result is a weapon which
allows a single man in a control center to fire a load of 20 shells
without help.  SPRUANCE is fitted with two such guns that can fire over
15 rounds/minute at ranges exceeding 10 miles, with devastating
accuracy.

<P>ANTI-AIR.  NATO Sea Sparrow Point Defense Missile System, also know as
Sea Sparrow, is a close-in air defense system employing the RIM-7M
Sparrow Missile.  The system is designed to counter the threat of enemy
aircraft and anti-ship cruise missiles.  The system is produced as a
cooperative effort by the U.S. and other NATO countries - Norway,
Belgium, Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands.

<P>COMMUNICATIONS AND TACTICAL INFORMATION.  The radio equipment aboard
the ship enables SPRUANCE to send and receive messages from any part
of the world.  Operating 24 hours a day, speed and accuracy have been
refined to an art by SPRUANCE radiomen.  Communicating within a battle
group for tactical purposes is accomplished through the Naval Tactical
Data Systems (NTDS).  Using high speed computer-to-computer data links,
NTDS welds together the processing capabilities and sensors (radars,
SONAR, etc.) of each of the individual units in company, presenting a
complete tactical picture.

<P>SH-60B HELICOPTER.  The Light Airborne Multi-Purpose Systems, or LAMPS
MK III, is a twin-engine helicopter that carries a crew of two pilots
and a sensor operator/crewman.  The primary mission of LAMPS MK III is
Anti-Submarine Warfare.  The SH-60B Seahawk is equipped with a sonobuoy
deployment and interpretation system, Magnetic Anomaly Detection (MAD)
gear, and threat detection/display equipment.  Additionally, the
aircraft is capable of carrying ASW torpedoes.  LAMPS MK III secondary
missions include gunfire spotting, over-the-horizon targeting, MEDEVAC,
and search and rescue operations.

<P>SPRUANCES's flight deck has been modified to accommodate the Recovery
Assist Securing and Transversing (RAST) System.  This system allows
helicopter flight operations in heavy weather.

<P>PROPULSION.  SPRUANCE employs gas turbine propulsion, and was the first
large U.S. warship to use four General Electric LM-2500 marine gas
turbine engines, a shaft power version of the TF39 turbofan aircraft
engine, producing a total of 80,000 shaft horsepower, and controllable
pitch propellers.  Each of the three gas turbine generators produces
2,000 kilowatts of power.

<P>AN/SQR-19.  The AN/SQR-19 Tactical Towed Array SONAR (TACTAS) is a
series of acoustic modules designed to be towed at the end of a long
cable out of the stern of the ship.  This allows for the reduction of
the noise emanating from the SPRUANCE and increasing the ship's passive
capability.  The Hoist Room, located under the fantail, contains the
cable and the array.  The display consoles are located in SONAR
Control.

<P>AN/SQQ-89 SONAR SYSTEM.  The AN/SQQ-89 SONAR System is designed to
incorporate several subsystems, including the AN/SQS-53B Hull-Mounted
SONAR, AN/SQS-19 Towed Array, LAMPS MK III Sonobuoys, and MK 116 MOD
6 Underwater Fire Control System (UFCS).  It is the most advanced SONAR
system in today's Fleet.  Combining three SONAR systems and a fire
control system into one suite, it gives SPRUANCE the ability to use the
best of all systems, while overcoming the disadvantages of any one
system.
