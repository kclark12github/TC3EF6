<P>The official crest of <A HREF="DD963P.GIF">SPRUANCE</A> is highly symbolic of the ship it so
strikingly represents.  The trident is a naval symbol of authority,
power, and maritime dominion.  The "double trident" device indicates
that SPRUANCE is an entirely new class of Navy destroyer, that is more
than twice (or double) the size of the destroyer of World War II.  The
six points of the trident refer to the ship's versatility and multi-
mission:  (1) Anti-Submarine Warfare operations in protection of
carrier strike forces and amphibious forces, (2) strike operations
against shore targets, (3) Anti-Surface Warfare against hostile
shipping, (4) Anti-Air Warfare for self-protection, (5) command,
control and communications, and (6) humanitarian missions, such as
rescue and evacuation operations.

<P>The crest symbolizes the Battle of Midway in 1942, in which Admiral
Spruance, for whom the ship is named, administered a decisive defeat
to a large Japanese Naval Force.  The cherry blossom, similar in design
to that worn by the personnel of the Japanese Navy, symbolizes, in
itself, a number of associations with the decisive battle.

<P>The end of the petals simulate the letter "M" for Midway, the letter
"V" for victory, and the Creek letter "SIGMA" for SPRUANCE.  The five
petals allude to the five Japanese ships (four aircraft carriers and
one cruiser) sunk in battle.  The 15 small dots and larger center dot
add up to 16, thus referring to "Task Force 16," the numerical
designation of the task force under Admiral Spruance's command.  The
15 small dots also allude to the six cruisers and nine destroyers, and
the larger center dot refers to the two aircraft carriers which made
Task Force 16.

<P>The red disc, cut off at "Midway," refers to the Japanese defeat, which
was the decisive naval action in the Pacific, and halted any further
Japanese advance.  The crossed staffs signify the canceling out of
Japanese Naval air power and naval ambition.  The four white five-
pointed stars on the banner of blue indicate the ultimate rank by
Admiral Spruance during the Second World War in the Pacific.
