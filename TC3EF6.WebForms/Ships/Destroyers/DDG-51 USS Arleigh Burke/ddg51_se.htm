                    <center> THE CREST </center>

<p>    A ship's crest is an insignia designed specifically for a particular
vessel.  During World War II, crests decorated the bridges and
smokestacks of hundreds of American naval vessels.  Strictly speaking,
none of this art work was legal - at least according to wartime military
regulations - but that didn't bother the men of the U.S. Navy.  Most
insignias were designed by and for crew members.  Insignias have also
been used to represent a group of ships.  During the 1940s, some vessels
carried squadron insignias.  For the Sailors of Arleigh Burke's Destroyer
Squadron 23, it all started when one crew member scribbled a drawing of
the comic strip character &quot;Little Beaver&quot; on a torpedo tube.  Later, when
the Little Beaver was adopted as the &quot;official&quot; squadron insignia, all
squadron members became known as Little Beavers.

<p>    In the mid-1950s, the U.S. Navy bowed to the inevitable and
recognized crests and insignias, but only for unofficial use.  Today, the
designing of crests has become a formalized art, with each element of the
crest having a specific symbolic meaning.  Now, most new ship crests are
drawn up by the Institute of Heraldry.

SHIELD:  <dd>Dark blue and gold are the colors traditionally associated with
         the U.S. Navy.  Blue represents the sea, and Gold is for
         excellence.  The ribbon which bears the words, &quot;FAST AND
         FEARED,&quot; signifies Admiral Burke's outstanding achievements and
         battle honors during WW II.  The 23 gold disks symbolize Admiral
         Burke's Destroyer Squadron 23, the only U.S. Destroyer Squadron
         to win the Presidential Unit Citation.  This award is also
         represented by the small ship's flag in the left corner of the
         shield.  The gauntlet grasping the mace represents the offensive
         and defensive capabilities of ARLEIGH BURKE.  The mace, which
         stands for authority, symbolizes Admiral Burke's leadership as
         Chief of Naval Operations.

CREST:   <dd>Saint George depicts Admiral Burke's World War II victory over
         the Japanese at the Battle of St. George.  Saint George, in full
         battle dress, implies the might and preparedness of the new
         destroyer.  His cape, which bears the cross of Saint George,
         incorporates a thin gold cross in its design.  This signifies
         the Navy Cross awarded to Admiral Burke.  The red sea dragon
         stands for the formidable Japanese naval power Admiral Burke
         confronted in the Pacific.  The two gold stars on the dragon's
         collar represent Admiral Burke's awards.  The birch branch on
         the helmet refers to the family name of Admiral Burke's
         Scandinavian ancestors - Bjorkegren.  It symbolizes the power of
         the continuing heritage of the ARLEIGH BURKE.
