<P>    Arleigh A. Burke, whose courage and speedy sailing made him one of
the Navy's biggest heroes during World War II, and who later sped past
more senior admirals to take charge of the service during a critical
peacetime transition, died Monday, 1 January 1996.  He was 94.

<P>    His current successor as Chief of Naval Operations, ADM Mike
Boorda, hailed Burke as "the Sailor's Sailor," and said he "defined
what it means to be a naval officer:  Relentless in combat, resourceful
in command, and revered by his crews."

<P>    His wife, the former Bobbie Gorsuch of Fairfax, survives.  The
couple had no children.  They had just passed their 72nd wedding
anniversary in June 1995, having wed in June 1923 on the day he
graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and was commissioned an ensign.

<P>    The Navy's most famous destroyer man was born in Boulder, Colorado
on 19 October 1901.  Graduating from the Naval Academy in 1923, he served
on the USS ARIZONA (BB 39) and the USS PROCYN (AG 11) before returning
to the Academy for post-graduate education, and then the University of
Michigan, where he received his master's degree in engineering in 1931.

<P>    Specializing in ordnance, he was assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance
between tours on the heavy cruiser USS CHESTER (CA 27) and the destroyer
USS MUGFORD (DD 389).  Promoted to Lieutenant Commander in 1939, he
commanded the MUGFORD before being assigned Ordnance Inspector at the
Washington Navy Yard.

<P>    In January 1943, he was awarded command of Destroyer Division 43 and
hoisted his flag on the USS WALLER (DD 466), which, in March of 1943,
blew up a Japanese destroyer in the Central Solomons.  In May he shifted
to command of Destroyer Division 44, escorting convoys in the Solomons.
Captain Burke took over Destroyer Squadron 12 in August 1943, and then
Destroyer Squadron 23 two months later.  The latter came to be know as
the "Little Beavers" after their insignia based on the character from the
popular Red Ryder comic strip.  Captain Burke also commanded one of the
Squadrons' two divisions, No. 45, his flag on the USS CHARLES AUBURNE (DD
570).  In the van at the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, Bougainville, in
November 1943, he distinguished himself in leading several torpedo
attacks, which sank a number of Japanese warships.  At the end of the
month he surpassed this performance at the Battle of Cape St. George, New
Ireland.  In what has been termed a "near perfect tactical action" by
military, Little Beavers destroyed three ships of larger Japanese force
without sustaining the slightest damage.

<P>    It was at this time that Captain Burke's ability to lead his squadron
in spectacular dashes at high speed caught the public's attention and
earned him the nickname "Thirty-One Knot Burke."

<P>    In March 1944, Destroyer Squadron 23 joined Task Force 58.  Burke,
in the rank of Commodore, became Chief of Staff to the Force Commander,
Admiral Marc A. Mitscher.  As such, he participated in the landings at
Hollandia and Saipan, and in the battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte
Gulf.  His role of assisting the now commander, First Fast Carrier Force
Pacific Fleet increased during the Force's participation in the Iwo Jima
Islands.  After a Kamikaze strike during the Okinawa Campaign, Commodore
Burke personally rescued several Sailors from a burning compartment on
the USS BUNKER HILL.  He was rewarded with a Silver Star for his heroism.

<P>    Following World War II, Burke was Chief of Staff of the 8th Fleet,
the Atlantic Fleet, and then served in the Office of the Chief of Naval
Operations.

<P>    Promoted to Rear Admiral in 1950, he served in Korea as Commander
Cruiser Division Five, and in 1951 as United Nations delegate to the
truce talks with North Korea.

<P>    In May 1955, President Eisenhower nominated the 53-year old Burke to
the post of Chief of Naval Operations, bypassing 87 active duty officers
senior to him.  Confirmed in August, he took over later that month and
held the office for an unprecedented six years (1955-1961).  Admiral
Burke acted as a major force on the Joint Chief of Staff in developing
the Navy's Polaris submarine missile program and in keeping it under Navy
control; he also utilized the new FORRESTAL Class carriers in a nuclear
deterrent role.  During his tenure, the Navy also made the shift to
guided missiles for anti-aircraft defense, jet-powered carrier aircraft,
and developed the first nuclear-powered surface ships.  He retired in
August 1961.

<P> <CENTER> MRS. ARLEIGH BURKE, SPONSOR </CENTER>

<P>    Mrs. Arleigh Burke has been known for years as the "First Lady of the
Navy."

<P>    Born Roberta Gorsuch in Lawrence, Kansas on 3 January 1899, Mrs.
Burke was raised in the Mid-West and in Washington, D.C.  She met Admiral
Burke on a blind date during his plebe year at the Naval Academy.  Four
years later on 7 June 1923 - the day Arleigh Burke became Ensign Arleigh
Burke - Miss Roberta Gorsuch became Mrs. Arleigh Burke.  The newlyweds
managed a one-night honeymoon in Baltimore before heading west to
Bremerton, Washington and Ensign Burkes' first duty aboard the battleship
ARIZONA.  It was the joyous start of a marriage that has endured nearly
seven decades.

<P>    It was also the beginning of a military life of frequent separations
and uprootings.  But Mrs. Burke - who possesses the rare ability to turn
chaos into order - quickly developed a foolproof system of house hunting
to satisfy a husband who wanted to spend his shore leave with her, while
still not losing sight of his beloved ship.  Mrs. Burke says "I'd get the
word when ARIZONA was returning from sea, and find out where she was
going to dock.  Then I'd start walking...  Usually I found something.
Although now and again Arleigh just had to put up with being out of sight
of his big canoe."

<P>    She has always been a Navy wife - first and foremost.  When her
husband limited her baggage to one household box and a wardrobe trunk,
she managed.  When her husband was sent to gunnery school in New York
City and she was given a household budget of $120 to stretch out for six
weeks, she prevailed.

<P>    During the war years, she lived on a sun porch in Washington, D.C. -
once again in sight of the water.  She devoted herself to Red Cross work
and to helping other Navy wives learn to cope with their husband's long
wartime absences.  For the U.S. Navy, as well as for Admiral Arleigh
Burke, Roberta Burke went about her job with an inner strength that never
seemed to falter.

<P>    Asked once about her secret for a long and happy marriage, Mrs. Burke
said:

<P>    "It's like moving from a house to an apartment.  You bring all your
favorite properties and you enjoy the things you like best.  It's that
way with another person.  You appreciate the best things about them more
as the years go by."

<P>    During the years Admiral Burke spent as Chief of Naval Operations,
Mrs. Burke was one of Washington's warmest and most elegant hostesses.
She is also an accomplished musician.  Yet, in spite of all this, she
remains a modest woman.  When asked what her biography should say, she
answered:

<P>    "Just tell them I am the wife of Arleigh Burke."
