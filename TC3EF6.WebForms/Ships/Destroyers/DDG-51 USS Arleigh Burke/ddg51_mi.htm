<CENTER> ARLEIGH BURKE CLASS DESTROYERS </CENTER>

<P>    Destroyers have traditionally been the workhorse of the Navy.  Their
multi-mission capabilities give them the versatility to carry out a wide
range of missions.  These include operating in high threat environments
with carrier battle groups, escorting amphibious and logistics ships, or
operating independently.

<P>    ARLEIGH BURKE is the first of the most powerful and survivable class
of destroyers ever put to sea.  She possesses the AEGIS Weapons System
with the AN/SPY-1D multi-function radar, capable of detecting and
tracking over one hundred targets simultaneously, while conducting
multiple engagements; the Vertical Launching System, capable of storing
and rapidly firing 90 missiles; the SQQ-89 Anti-Submarine Warfare System
with its SQR-19 Towed Array SONAR and the new SQS-53C Digital Hull-
Mounted SONAR; the Harpoon Anti-Ship Cruise Missile System; and the
Tomahawk Anti-Ship and Land Attack Cruise Missile System, capable of
hitting targets hundreds of miles away.  She also carries improved
versions of the 5-inch gun and the Phalanx Close-In Weapons System.

<P>    ARLEIGH BURKE represents a return to all-steel construction, and
incorporates electromagnetic pulse hardening, enhanced fire fighting
features, and a Collective Protection System to provide protection
against nuclear, chemical or biological contamination.  Her vital
equipment is distributed through the ship, and she has improved blast and
fragmentation protection to enable her to survive a hit and continue to
fight.

<P>                   <CENTER> THE SHIP </CENTER>

<P>    The AEGIS Weapon System, which distinguishes the U.S. Navy's most
capable battle group surface combatants, is the heart of the ship's war-
fighting capability.  The AEGIS system is an extensive integration of
electronic detection, engagement and control equipment, and provides
ARLEIGH BURKE with a truly multi-mission capability - fully equipping her
to meet the demands of the missile era.

<P>    ARLEIGH BURKE's AEGIS Weapon System, combined with her Vertical
Launching System (VLS), can rapidly fire more missiles, and guide them
in flight, with greater accuracy than any existing system.  The AEGIS
system, produced by General Electric, is designed to counter all current
and projected missile threats to the Navy's battle forces.

<P>    A conventional, mechanically rotating radar "sees" a target when the
radar beam strikes that target once during each 360 degree rotation of
the antenna.  A separate tracking radar is then required to engage each
target.  In contrast, the computer-controlled AN/SPY-1D phased array
radar of the AEGIS system brings these functions together within one
system.  The four fixed arrays of "SPY" send out beams of electromagnetic
energy in all directions simultaneously, continuously providing a search
and tracking capability for hundreds of targets at the same time.

<P>    ARLEIGH BURKE is equipped with the MK 41 VLS, a multi-warfare missile
launching system capable of firing a mix of missiles against airborne and
surface threats.  It is modular in design, with eight modules
symmetrically grouped to form a launcher magazine.  The modules contain
all the necessary components for launching functions when interfaced with
the ship's AEGIS Weapon System.  VLS is a product of Martin-Marietta.

<P>    The ship's weapons include Standard surface-to-air missiles, Tomahawk
and Harpoon surface-to-surface cruise missiles, Phalanx rapid-fire guns,
5" rapid-fire gun and torpedoes.

<P>    The ship's weapon systems are supplemented by electronic warfare
countermeasures, decoys, and passive detection systems.  The AEGIS system
can also direct the operations of fighter aircraft and helicopters in
protection of the battle group.  The AEGIS display system, a series of
two large-screen displays, enables the Commanding Officer and Tactical
Action Officer to remain constantly abreast of the battle situation.
