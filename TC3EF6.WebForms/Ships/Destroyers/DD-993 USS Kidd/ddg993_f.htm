<center>USS KIDD (DD 661)</center>

<P>DDG 993 is the second ship to bear the name of <A href="DDG993NS.GIF"> Rear Admiral Isaac
C. Kidd, Sr.</A>  The first was a destroyer, which saw considerable action,
and earned numerous battle stars.

<P>    DD 661 was commissioned at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 23 April 1943.
Destroyers are traditionally named for heroes of the naval service, and
DD 661 was named for one of the first heroes of the war she was about
to enter, RADM Isaac C. Kidd.  The name KIDD seems particularly
appropriate for a fighting ship.  It stirs images not only of RADM
Kidd's heroism, but also of Captain Kidd, the pirate, and colorful
fighting tales of the sea.  DD 661's crew had a picture of Captain Kidd
painted on the after stack, and eventually came to call themselves "The
Pirates of the Pacific."

<P>    KIDD's early months of service were uneventful.  She operated in
the North Atlantic as a member of various task forces, but saw little
action.  In August 1943, KIDD accompanied a group of battleships
through the Panama Canal to her eventual destination in the Pacific
Theater.  Her primary duty was screening battleships and other high
value units against air and submarine attack.  In October, KIDD rescued
several downed aviators following an air raid on Wake Island.

<P>    Later that month, KIDD received her baptism by fire.  KIDD was
screening a large task force of battleships and carriers that were to
strike at Rabaul and provide support for the Bougainville landing.  On
the morning of 11 November 1943, the Force was bombarding Rabaul when
the Japanese launched an air strike.  As KIDD was attempting to rescue
the crew of a plane that had crashed on takeoff from the carrier USS
ESSEX, several enemy planes attacked, including torpedo bombers.  For
fifty minutes KIDD maneuvered to dodge torpedoes, engaged eight
aircraft, and successfully recovered the plane crew.  KIDD shot down
three of the enemy planes and scored hits on several others.  The ship
had proved herself in the severest of tests.

<P>    For the next year, KIDD screened several carrier task forces and
posted an impressive tally of enemy planes downed.  During this time,
she participated in the invasions of the Gilbert and Marshall Islands.
In the Marshall Invasion, she was the first ship to follow the
minesweepers into the Lagoon at Majuro and from there bombarded enemy
positions in preparation for the landing.  KIDD was similarly involved
in the landings on Aitape, Hollandia and Guam, providing gunfire
support.  In one landing, she dared to go within 2,000 yards of the
enemy coast to rescue a downed pilot.  In October 1944, KIDD
participated in the invasion of the Philippines, providing screening
and gunfire support, before departing for Mare Island Naval Shipyard
for a much-needed overhaul.

<P>    Leaving Mare Island in February 1945, KIDD joined Task Force 58,
which was to invade Okinawa.  During the campaign, KIDD screened
battleships, rescued pilots, and did some mine-sweeping.  She also
faced her most exacting ordeal of the war.

<P>    On 11 April 1945, KIDD was part of the air defense screen
attempting to cope with the furious Kamikaze attacks.  A lone enemy
plane penetrated the outer air defenses, and despite being hit,
continued to fly straight toward KIDD.  It was a Kamikaze, with 500
pounds of high explosives aboard.  The plane hit the side of the ship
above the water line, blasting a hugh hole, killing 38 men and wounding
55.  The damage control organization worked; the surviving crew members
kept the ship afloat.  They buried their dead at sea, and the ship
limped back to California for extensive repairs.

<P>    For KIDD, the war was over.  She had earned six battle stars across
the Pacific, and had served with distinction.  She had proved her
mettle at Okinawa in the most intense anti-air warfare environment ever
encountered, one in which numerous other ships were sunk and some 5,000
sailors perished.

<P>    KIDD continued to serve for almost twenty more years.  She earned
four more battle stars in the Korean conflict, and joined task forces
dispatched to respond to a variety of crises.  On 19 June 1964, KIDD
was decommissioned and sent to the mothball fleet in Philadelphia.

<P>    Soon after her decommissioning, a group of former KIDD shipmates
formed the USS KIDD Association.  Besides preserving KIDD's history and
collecting mementos, the Association sought to have the ship preserved
as a war memorial.  The Association was successful, and received
financial assistance from the Louisiana Naval War Memorials Commission
to have the ship made into a memorial at Baton Rouge.  DD 661 was
moored at temporary berth, awaiting completion of a permanent berth in
1981.  Once the ship was installed in her place of honor, she was ready
to receive the visitors who, by their donations, will keep DD 661 a
lasting memorial to a heroic admiral and to the proud men who served
this proud ship.
