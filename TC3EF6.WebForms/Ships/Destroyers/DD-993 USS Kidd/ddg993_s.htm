<p>THE SHIP'S CREST</center>

<p>    KIDD's crest summarizes, in graphic form, the history and tradition
described in this chapter.  The Coat of Arms' dark blue shield alludes
to the sea, and the naval officer's dress sword, with point up, reflects
Rear Admiral Kidd's distinguished career.  The sword also represents
the fighting record of the previous USS KIDD (DD 661), which recorded
eight battle honors for her participation in the Pacific Theater of
World War II and in the Korean War.  The two stars signify these two
wars, and represent the Admiral's rank at the time of his death.

<p>    The roaring lion, symbolic of strength, courage, and leadership,
alludes to the fighting spirit of the ship and her crew.  The lion is
wearing a light blue ribbon, bearing an inverted gold silhouette of a
star.  The ribbon and star represent the Medal of Honor posthumously
awarded the Admiral.  Rear Admiral Kidd was killed on the bridge of his
flagship, USS ARIZONA (BB 39), during the Pearl Harbor attack.

<p>    The blue scroll beneath the shield bears the Kidd family motto,
&quot;NIL SINE MAGNO LABORE&quot; (Nothing without Great Labor), to serve as a
reminder that success requires the highest standards and greatest
effort.  The seal is surrounded by a continuous gold anchor chain.

<p>    The Coat of Arms of USS KIDD (DDG 993) is filled with the rich
United States Navy tradition of honorable service to country, and is
dedicated to the fighting spirit of Rear Admiral Kidd.

<p>    &quot;We were honored to have served.  Honored to have served a nation
    that could give the world Freedom...&quot;  - Admiral Isaac C. Kidd,
    USN (Ret.) for his father, Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, USN
                          - 13 October 1979 -
