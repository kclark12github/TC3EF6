 <center>USS KIDD (DDG 993)</center>

<P>    "I am tired of talking about what the threat is.  Let us be the
    threat.  I want to read about how Admiral Gorshkov stays awake
    nights worrying about our threat to his Navy."
         - Admiral Thomas Hayward, Chief of Naval Operations -

<P><A href="DDG993P.GIF">KIDD</A> is the first of a new class of guided missile destroyers.  The
most formidable warship of her size ever to patrol the world's oceans,
KIDD is a thoroughbred, blending the best features of the SPRUANCE
Class destroyers with the combat system of the VIRGINIA Class nuclear
cruisers.

<P>    The product is a ship with unique characteristics:
<PRE>
         a.  A ship so quiet, and an ASW system so capable, that she
operates offensively against submarines.

         b.  The most sophisticated medium-range AAW systems in the
Fleet, quick-reacting and highly accurate, with the capability for
today's air defense environment and the growth potential for
tomorrow's.

         c.  An exceptionally reliable and responsive engineering
plant.

         d.  A deadly surface-to-surface weapons capability.</PRE>

<P>    These characteristics make KIDD a triple-threat, one of the few
truly multi-mission ships.  Some of KIDD's capabilities are apparent
in the statistics and descriptions which follow.  However, KIDD is much
more than the sum of component systems.  Able to operate offensively,
to deal with simultaneous air, surface, and sub-surface attacks, this
is a ship designed to go in harm's way - and win.

<P>    Propulsion System.  KIDd's propulsion system is an automated, gas
turbine installation, which can be controlled from either the Pilot
House or the Central Control Station.  The system is located in two
main engine rooms, each containing two LM-2500 marine gas turbines.
The two LM-2500s are coupled through clutches and locked train, double
helical, double reduction gears to drive a controllable, reversible
pitch propeller.  With all four turbines on line and both shafts
driving, the plant can deliver 80,000 shaft horsepower, for a top speed
in excess of 30 knots.

<P>    Combat System.  KIDD's combat system is her complement of weapons
and electronics subsystems and equipment, which collectively enables her
to carry out combat missions.  These missions include:
<PRE>
         a.  AAW:  Anti-Air Warfare

         b.  ASW:  Anti-Submarine Warfare

         c.  ASU:  Anti-Surface Warfare

         d.  AMW:  Amphibious Warfare - Naval Gunfire Support

         e.  ELW:  Electronic Warfare

         f.  CCC:  Command, Control, and Communications</PRE>

<P> <center>AAW</center>
<P>  In air engagements, initial target detection is usually
provided by the long-range air search radar.  This is a three-
dimensional, electronically-stabilized, computer-controlled radar,
which includes an Automatic Detection and Tracking (ADT) capability.

<P>    Target data is transferred, automatically or manually, to the
computer of the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS).  NTDS is the heart
of the combat system, tying together the various subsystems, collecting
and processing information from ship sensors, and from off-ship sensors,
via radio digital data links.

<P>    From NTDS, air targets are sent to one of the following weapons for
engagement:
<PRE>
         a.  For long-range engagements, to Combat Air Patrol (CAP)
aircraft.

         b.  For medium-range engagements, to either of the TARTAR D
Missile Systems.

         c.  For short-range engagements, to either of the Gun Weapon
Systems.

         d.  For very close-in engagements, to the Vulcan-Phalanx
Close-In Weapons System (CIWS).  The CIWS consists of two mounts (port
and starboard), each consisting of a fire control system and a Gatling-
type machine gun.  The CIWS automatically searches for, acquires, and
destroys air targets at close range.</PRE>

<P> <center>ASW</center>
<P> The primary ASW sensors are the ship-mounted SONAR and a
variety of sensors carried by ASW aircraft.  The KIDD's long-range
SONAR is capable of detecting, classifying and tracking underwater
targets.  Data from the SONAR is provided to the Underwater Fire
Control System (UFCS) and to NTDS for display and decision.  The UFCS
computes orders for launching torpedoes from the torpedo tubes, for
firing Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC) torpedoes from the missiles
launcher, and for weapon release points for ASW aircraft.

<P>    The ship can carry two Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS)
Helicopters.  These provide an extended localization and weapon
delivery capability in ASW, and expanded surveillance against anti-ship
missile threats.

<P> <center>ASU</center>
<P> The surface search radar, and the radar of the Gun Fire
Control System, are the primary active sensors for surface surveillance
and detection.  Surface targets can be engaged by one of the following
subsystems:
<PRE>
         a.  Harpoon Surface-to-Surface Missiles are capable of over-
the-horizon attacks on surface targets.  The Harpoon Weapon System
consists of two sets of four-canister launchers, and a fire control
system for designating targets to the missiles.

         b.  The TARTAR D System, used in the surface mode, is capable
of medium-range attacks on surface targets.

         c.  The Gun Weapon System can engage targets at shorter range.
Controlled by the Gun Fire Control System (GFCS), the 5" guns can
engage one or two targets out to the ballistic limits of 5" ammunition.

         d.  Against very close-in surface targets, the CIWS can be
fired in surface mode.</PRE>

<P> <center>ELW</center>
<P> The ship's Electronic Warfare Sensor is designated as an
anti-ship missile defense sensor.  It provides rapid and automatic
detection, processing, and analysis of enemy electronic emissions.  It
is used with four deck-mounted Super Rapid-Blooming Off-board Chaff
(SRBOC) mortar-type launchers, which provide defense against homing
missiles by creating deceptive chaff targets.

<P>    Communication.  KIDD has a modern, automated communications system.
For Fleet Broadcast Traffic, the Naval Modular Automated Communication
System (NAVMACS) A-Plus uses a computer for automated message
processing.  NAVMACS is joined with a satellite communications
transceiver and a satellite receiver to provide high-speed, low-
interference information transfer via satellite links.  For two-way
tactical communications, KIDD carries a full range of modern UHF, VHF,
and HF radio equipment.
