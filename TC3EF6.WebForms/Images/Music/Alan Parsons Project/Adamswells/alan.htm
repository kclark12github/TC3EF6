<p><font face="Arial">Alan Parsons first know work was with the
Beatles on their &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album. Shortly
thereafter, he began creating his own platinum selling albums
with his group, &quot;The Alan Parsons Project&quot;. Ever since
I heard the Alan Parsons Project sing the song <em><strong>&quot;Time&quot;</strong></em>
from their <em><strong>&quot;Turn of a Friendly Card&quot;</strong></em>
album in 1980, I was hooked. After producing and engineering many
CD's, each one is unique, and most have a theme to them. Alan has
always given the customer a great album cover, so I decided to
include a picture of the album cover, a short description of the
theme of the album, along with my favorite (and SuperFave) songs
from the album. <strong>Note:</strong> All opinions on themes are
my own, except for <em><strong>Pyramid</strong></em>, which was
taken from the inside tray card.</font></p>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td><font color="#000000" face="Arial"><img src="images/Mystery.jpg" alt="Tales of Mystery" align="left" border="10" hspace="0" width="142" height="139"></font></td>
        <td><font face="Arial"><em><strong>&quot;Tales of Mystery
        and Imagination&quot;</strong></em>. Released in 1976,
        this was the first Alan Parsons Project album. It is
        fitting that my most favorite Alan Parsons song, <em>&quot;</em><em><strong>To
        One In Paradise&quot;</strong></em>, is on this album.
        Another favorite song on this album is <em>&quot;</em><em><strong>Doctor
        Tarr And Professor Fether&quot;</strong></em><strong>.</strong>
        The theme for this album was dedicated to the works of
        Edgar Allan Poe. Alan decided to use the &quot;concept
        album&quot; approach after working with Pink Floyd on
        &quot;The Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;.</font></td>

        <td><font face="Arial"><em><strong>&quot;I Robot&quot;</strong></em>.
        1977. The theme for this album is the rise of the machine
        and the decline of man. When man tried to create robot in
        his own image, he was imitating what God did many years
        before. This imitation theme is evident with the song
        entitled <em><strong>&quot;Genesis Chapter 1 Verse
        32&quot;</strong></em>. Genesis chapter one (also known
        to me as the &quot;creation&quot; chapter in the Holy
        Bible) only has 31 verses. Man tried to imitate Gods'
        creation with something artificial (a verse 32) and
        failed. <em><strong>&quot;Some Other Time&quot;</strong></em>
        is a favorite from this album.</font></td>

        <td><font face="Arial"><em><strong>&quot;Pyramid&quot;</strong></em>,
        1978. This album seeks to amplify the echoes of the past
        and explore the unsolved mysteries of the present.
        Pyramid...the last remaining wonder of the ancient world.
        Favorite songs include <em><strong>&quot;What Goes
        Up&quot;</strong></em>, <em><strong>&quot;The Eagle will
        Rise Again&quot;</strong></em>, <em><strong>&quot;Can't
        Take It With You&quot;</strong></em>, and <em><strong>&quot;Pyromania&quot;</strong></em>.</font></td>

        <td><font face="Arial"><em><strong>&quot;Eve&quot;</strong></em>,
        1979. You can guess the theme for this album (Hint:
        Women). Can't live with them, can't live without them.
        This album, <em><strong>&quot;Try Anything Once&quot;,</strong></em>
        and <em><strong>&quot;Freudiana&quot; </strong></em>were
        the only albums which include songs where a woman sings
        the lead vocals. SuperFave song <em><strong>&quot;Winding
        Me Up&quot;</strong></em> and favorite song <em><strong>&quot;If
        I Could Change Your Mind&quot;</strong></em> are included
        on this album.</font></td>

        <td><font face="Arial"><em><strong>&quot;Turn Of A
        Friendly Card&quot;</strong></em>, 1980. Life can
        sometimes be related to a game...a game where time and
        chance are as important as luck and skill. Favorites
        include <em><strong>&quot;Time&quot;</strong></em>, the
        instrumental work <em><strong>&quot;The Gold Bug&quot;</strong></em>,
        and the <em><strong>&quot;Turn Of A Friendly Card&quot;</strong></em>

        Sky&quot;</strong></em>, 1982. Think Big Brother is
        watching over you? Wondering what people are saying about
        you in other circles? Paranoia setting in from hearing
        whispers in the night? According to the general public,
        this was the best selling Alan Parsons Project album
        made. <em><strong>&quot;Eye In The Sky&quot;</strong></em>,
        <em><strong>&quot;Silence And I&quot;</strong></em> and <em><strong>&quot;Psychobabble&quot;</strong></em>
        are my favorites on this album.</font></td>

        Avenue&quot;</strong></em>, 1983. Global warming,
        careless pollution, and lack of concern for one another
        must have prompted this album. This is <em>my</em>
        favorite Alan Parsons album. Favorite songs include <em><strong>&quot;Prime
        Time&quot;</strong></em>, <em><strong>&quot;Let Me Go
        Home&quot;</strong></em>, <em><strong>&quot;One Good
        Reason&quot;</strong></em>, <em><strong>&quot;Since The

        <td><font face="Arial"><em><strong>&quot;Vulture
        Culture&quot;</strong></em>, 1984. In this dog-eat-dog
        world, it's every man for himself! Selfish song titles
        like <em><strong>&quot;Separate Lives&quot;</strong></em>,
        <em><strong>&quot;Vulture Culture&quot;</strong></em> and
        <em><strong>&quot;Let's Talk About Me&quot;</strong></em>
        personify the greed and self-centered nature of mankind.
        Favorites include <em><strong>&quot;Sooner or Later&quot;</strong></em>
        and the instrumental work <em><strong>&quot;Hawkeye&quot;</strong></em>
        (especially that saxophone!)</font></td>

        <td><font face="Arial"><em><strong>&quot;Keats&quot;</strong></em>,
        1984. Alan Parsons only produced this album. I thought I
        would mention it here because Keats (the name of the
        group -and- the album) was mostly made up of musicians
        that had been in the Alan Parsons Project at one time or
        another. Keats took it's name from a West London
        restaurant that Alan frequented after recording sessions
        in the studio. Smooth sounding <em><strong>&quot;Walking
        On Ice&quot;</strong></em> is a favorite from this album.</font></td>

        <td><font face="Arial"><em><strong>&quot;Stereotomy&quot;</strong></em>,
        1985. In my understanding, this album could relate to
        someone with a dual personality, sometimes light,
        sometimes dark. Exploring the how and why of the swings
        between the two personalities are what this album expands
        on. Favorites include <em><strong>&quot;Beaujolais&quot;</strong></em>,
        <em><strong>&quot;Limelight&quot;</strong></em>, and <em><strong>&quot;Light
        Of The World&quot;</strong></em>.</font></td>

        <td><font face="Arial"><em><strong>&quot;Gaudi&quot;</strong></em>,
        1987. This album was inspired by the life and works of
        Antonio Gaudi (1852-1926), whose Sagrada Familia
        Cathedral in Barcelona, Spain, involves a construction
        timetable which will run for hundreds of years. <em><strong>&quot;La
        Sagrada Familia&quot;</strong></em>, <em><strong>&quot;Standing
        On Higher Ground&quot;</strong></em>, and <em><strong>&quot;Money
        Talks&quot;</strong></em> (how true) are favorites from

        1990. Songwriter Eric Woolfson and Alan collaborated on a
        musical about the life of Sigmund Freud. The music
        inspired a musical/stage production that opened in Vienna
        in December, 1990. After this album, Eric left the
        Project to concentrate on musicals (Gaudi was made into
        one). Favorite songs include <em><strong>&quot;Freudiana&quot;,
        &quot;Little Hans&quot;, &quot;Destiny&quot;</strong></em>,
        and Superfave <em><strong>&quot;Funny You Should Say

        Long time executive producer and songwriter Eric Woolfson
        has departed, prompting Alan to change the name of the
        group to simply &quot;Alan Parsons&quot;. This doesn't
        mean the quality of music has diminished. After a few
        years off, a different style emerges in favorites <em><strong>&quot;Breakaway&quot;</strong></em>,
        <em><strong>&quot;Mr. Time&quot;</strong></em>, <em><strong>&quot;Jigue&quot;</strong></em>,
        <em><strong>&quot;Siren Song&quot;</strong></em>, <em><strong>&quot;Back

        songs are live versions of studio hits, but as a bonus,
        three new studio tracks are included. The live songs are
        worthy counterparts to their respective studio tracks,
        but I enjoy the three new tracks at the end the most. <em><strong>&quot;When&quot;</strong></em>,
        <em><strong>&quot;Take The Money And Run&quot;</strong></em>
        (not the Steve Miller Band song), and <em><strong>&quot;You're

        1996. The theme for this album was actually born out of
        an accident. Guitar player Ian Bairnson's cousin was
        flying his helicopter on a peace mission in Iraq and was
        shot down by friendly fire. Ian wrote the song <em><strong>&quot;Brother
        Up In Heaven&quot;</strong></em>, and Alan decided the
        album theme would be about flight. Included in the United
        States version of the album was a multimedia CD-ROM that
        included video snippets with background music from the
        songs from the album. Favorites include <em><strong>&quot;Can't
