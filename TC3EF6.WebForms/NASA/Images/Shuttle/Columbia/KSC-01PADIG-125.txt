KSC-01PADIG-125 (03/05/2001) --- KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FLA. -- The orbiter Columbia, atop a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, taxis on the runway at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Skid Strip. The ferry flight began in California March 1. Unfavorable weather conditions kept it on the ground at Dyess AFB, Texas, until it could return to Florida. Columbia is returning from a 17-month-long modification and refurbishment process as part of a routine maintenance plan. The orbiter will next fly on mission STS-107, scheduled Oct. 25
