KSC-03PD-0127 (01/16/2003) --- KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FLA. -- After a perfect launch, spectators try to catch a last glimpse of Space Shuttle Columbia, barely visible at the top end of the twisted column of smoke. Following a flawless and uneventful countdown, liftoff occurred on-time at 10:39 a.m. EST. Headed for a 16-day research mission, Columbia's crew will be taking part in more than 80 experiment, including FREESTAR (Fast Reaction Experiments Enabling Science, Technology, Applications and Research) and the SHI Research Double Module (SHI/RDM), known as SPACEHAB. Experiments on the module range from material sciences to life sciences. This mission is the first Shuttle mission of 2003. Mission STS-107 is the 28th flight of the orbiter Columbia and the 113th flight overall in NASA's Space Shuttle program.
