KSC-02PD-1882 (12/09/2002) --- KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FLA. -- Space Shuttle Columbia rolls out from the Vehicle Assembly Building on its way to Launch Pad 39A. Columbia sits atop the Mobile Launcher Platform, which in turn is carried by the crawler-transporter underneath for the long, slow journey to the pad. The STS-107 research mission comprises experiments ranging from material sciences to life sciences (many rats), plus the Fast Reaction Experiments Enabling Science, Technology, Applications and Research (FREESTAR) that incorporates eight high priority secondary attached shuttle experiments. Mission STS-107 is scheduled to launch Jan. 16, 2003.
