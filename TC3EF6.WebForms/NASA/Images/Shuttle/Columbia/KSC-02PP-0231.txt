KSC-02PP-0231 (03/01/2002) --- KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. - A fish-eye lens gives a different perspective to the launch of Space Shuttle Columbia on mission STS-109. Torrents of water spread over the Mobile Launcher Platform from 12-foot rainbirds and into the flame trench as part of the sound suppression system. Acoustical levels reach their peak when the Space Shuttle is about 300 feet above the MLP. At left of the Shuttle is the Fixed Service Structure with the Orbiter Access Arm and White Room, seen in the foreground. Liftoff of Columbia occurred at 6:22:02:08 a.m. EST (11:22:02:08 GMT). This was the 27th flight of the vehicle and 108th in the history of the Shuttle program. The goal of the mission is the maintenance and upgrade of the Hubble Space Telescope, to be carried out in five spacewalks. The crew comprises Commander Scott D. Altman, Pilot Duane G. Carey, Payload Commander John M. Grunsfeld, and Mission Specialists Nancy Jane Currie, Richard M. Linnehan, James H. Newman and Michael J. Massimino. After the 11-day mission, Columbia is expected to return to KSC March 12 about 4:35 a.m. EST (09:35 GMT)
