KSC-02PD-0045 (01/28/2002) --- KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FLA. -- A grey sky begins silhouettes Space Shuttle Columbia, atop its Mobile Launcher Platform, as it rolls out to Launch Pad 39A. Underneath is the crawler-transporter, which carries the multi-ton vehicles to the pad. In the grass behind the towering structures are two white herons. Columbia is scheduled to be launched Feb. 28 on mission STS-109, a Hubble Servicing Mission. The goal of the mission is to replace Solar Array 2 with Solar Array 3, replace the Power Control Unit, remove the Faint Object Camera and install the ACS, install the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) Cooling System, and install New Outer Blanket Layer insulation
