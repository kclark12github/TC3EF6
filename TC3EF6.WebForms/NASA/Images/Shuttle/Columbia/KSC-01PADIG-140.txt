KSC-01PADIG-140 (03/06/2001) --- KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FLA. -- Orbiter Columbia arrives at KSC’s Shuttle Landing Facility atop a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft after a protracted trip from California that began March 1. Unfavorable weather conditions kept it on the ground at Dyess AFB, Texas, until it could return to Florida on March 5 when it landed at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Skid Strip. Columbia had to wait for the orbiter Atlantis which had completed a ferry flight to KSC on March 5 to be towed from the SLF before making the final hop to KSC. Columbia is returning from a 17-month-long modification and refurbishment process as part of a routine maintenance plan. The orbiter will next fly on mission STS-107, scheduled Oct. 25
