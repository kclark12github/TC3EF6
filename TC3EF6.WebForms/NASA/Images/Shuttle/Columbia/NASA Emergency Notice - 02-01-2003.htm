            <P><FONT size=4>LATEST INFORMATION ON SPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA 
            <P>A Space Shuttle contingency was declared on Saturday in Mission 
            Control when communication was lost with the Space Shuttle Columbia 
            during its return to Earth following a 16-day mission. 
            <P>Communication and tracking of the shuttle was lost at 9 a.m. EST 
            at an altitude of about 203,000 feet above north central Texas while 
            traveling approximately 12,500 miles per hour (Mach 18). No 
            communication and tracking information was received in Mission 
            Control after that time. 
            <P>Flight controllers in Mission Control immediately began the 
            process of securing all information, notes and data pertinent to 
            today's reentry and landing. 
            <P>News media wishing to cover the investigation should go to a NASA 
            Center newsroom or watch NASA Television for the latest 
            developments. NASA TV is on AMC-2, Transponder 9C, vertical 
            polarization at 85 degrees West longitude, 3880 MHz, with audio at 
            6.8 MHz. 
            <P><U>NOTE TO PERSONS IN THE AREA:</U><BR>Anyone who believes they 
            have found debris related to Columbia should call the Johnson Space 
            Center Emergency Operations Center, <FONT
