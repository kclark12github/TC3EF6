KSC-03PD-0075 (01/15/2003) --- KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FLA. -- After rollback of the Rotating Service Structure on Launch Pad 39A, the top of Space Shuttle Columbia's external tank and solid rocket booster are bathed in sunlight. Shadows from the Fixed Service Structure stretch across the Shuttle and landscape. Visible are the orbiter access arm with the White Room extended to Columbia's cockpit, and at the top, the gaseous oxygen vent arm and cap, called the "beanie cap." Columbia is scheduled for launch Jan. 16 at 10:39 a.m. EST on mission STS-107, a research mission.
