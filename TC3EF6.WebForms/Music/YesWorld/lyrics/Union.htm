<font size=-1 ><b>Anderson/Howe/Elias</b></font>

<p>I would have waited forever - For you to return into my life<br>

I would have waited forever - I would have given you everything I had<br>

I would have waited forever - There's no question, no question at all<br>

<p>So true in the prize, would you wait for me?<br>

All because you got burned, so you took what you needed.<br>

Some will always turn away, say it's reason enough;<br>

It's another game of exploration.<br>

Something calls at reverse and it comes to you;<br>

Experience everything as it comes true.<br>

<p>So - It will be then<br>

Change - It will happen<br>

See - That we feel it<br>

All - Is completed.<br>

<p>Don't you want the world to stop short of giving?<br>

Anytime of night or day, the magic things you love.<br>

Everybody hurts when you shout, when you walk away;<br>

Talk about it according to you.<br>

<p>I would have waited forever - For you to return into my life<br>

I would have waited forever - To give you everything I had<br>

I would have waited forever - There's no question about it at all<br>

<p>So inbetween the perfect flame of you, this love will never let you down.<br>

Just take it as it comes, for everything will come around.<br>

<p>You put your hand up: stop the flow of where you're going to;<br>

It's another game called exploration.<br>

How we imagine everything that we think we're going through;<br>

It's another reason to make the break.<br>

Everyone will move with you now to the riverside;<br>

Experience everything, but go with the landslide.<br>

<p>I would have waited forever - For you to return into my life<br>

I would have waited forever - To give you everything I had<br>

I would have waited forever - No question in my body and soul<br>

Forever...<br>

<font size=-1 ><b>Anderson/Howe/Elias</b></font><br>

<p>Shock to the system,<br>

But you're going back inside of the light.<br>

Shock to the freedom,<br>

Only one more body of love in the rolling - They're rolling back to you!<br>

Dreaming all the time; they be dreaming all the time.<br>

<p>Shock to the politicians;<br>

You know they just got burned by the fire.<br>

Shock to the freedom whispers;<br>

They're only coming after the rolling - They're rolling, coming over!<br>

Dreaming all the time; they be dreaming all the time.<br>

<p>So, in answer to the prayer,<br>

The one you want is there,<br>

The one you feel inside of you.<br>

So, in answer to the dream,<br>

This time you are so clear;<br>

It's always got to be this way!<br>

Forever...<br>

<p>Shock to the future;<br>

Shock to the rights of Mankind.<br>

And they won't even go blind,<br>

When they see what's going on.<br>

<p>So, in answer to the prayer,<br>

The one you feel is there,<br>

The one you feel so close to (The order of the Sun).<br>

And everyone is one,<br>

And all the pieces fit together.<br>

Did it all begin with Someone?<br>

Did it all begin with Someone?<br>

I could not admit to being alive!<br>

<p>Shock to the system...<br>

<font size=-1 ><b>Rabin/Squire</b></font><br>

<p>Look around - Got no place to stay.<br>

God I hate this town, depending on the day.<br>

You lift me up, you lift me down - Alright, OK.<br>

<p>While I got no life, I got no hope;<br>

I'm falling in love.<br>

Help me through the fight;<br>

Help me with tonight - I'm calling.<br>

<p>What to do I find it hard to know;<br>

Lord, the walk is not the one I chose...<br>

<p>Lift me up and turn me over;<br>

Lead me on into the dawn.<br>

Take me to the highest mountain;<br>

Tie me up, love in a storm.<br>

Have you decided on my fortune?<br>

Facing the future in your eyes,<br>

With your imperial behaviour<br>

We fight amidst the battle cries.<br>

<p>Open doors - They may be closed to me;<br>

The fire's still burning in my heart...<br>

<p>What to do I find it hard to know;<br>

I want to turn my life around...<br>

<p><br>

<br>

<p><font size="+2"><a name="5"></a>Without Hope, You Cannot Start the Day</font><sup>(4)</sup><br>

<font size=-1 ><b>Anderson/Elias</b></font>

<p>Hold still now for the moving information close to you.<br>

You could never force it in your life: this decision to break it.<br>

Without hope, you cannot start the day.<br>

<p>It's coming clear I've noticed;<br>

It's a different face you're showing.<br>

It's another "Welcome Back".<br>

I don't imagine it could be this way (So jealous).<br>

Only you can tell it; tell me why.<br>

Only you call tell it.<br>

Only you can say.<br>

Inbetween this moving out to save your soul it came away,<br>

And took it out;<br>

Oh why?<br>

<p>Fire burning wild, burning in the night, chasing in the wind;<br>

Shadows always dance in the rain, ringing into the fire.<br>

Doesn't matter who, who can see in the smile.<br>

Hope in the rain, open the flame, coming back in the night.<br>

I can see the rhythm of the rain; I can see it shout back under:<br>

<p>I can see what you're thinking of<br>

I can see what you think you need<br>

I can see what you're thinking of<br>

I can see that it must be love<br>

<p>Shadows come alight from the vision that flowed;<br>

Shake it off - Passion is the flame that fired.<br>

Does it matter? Can you give? Can you hear it come?<br>

Can you see you're like? <br>

What's the matter? Don't you want to risk? Don't you want to hold me?<br>

Hold me, dance in the rain.<br>

I can see the love in your eyes; I can see you coming.<br>

<p>I can see what you're thinking of<br>

I can see what you think you want<br>

I can see what you're thinking of<br>

I can see that it must be love<br>

<p>Sweet suffering, love protection: Need it, You need; Come to me.<br>

Believe it, better by far, your heart it there;<br>

Most of all: Believe it.<br>

Perfection Reaction...<br>

<p><font size="+2"><a name="6"></a>Saving My Heart</font><sup>(3)</sup><br>

<font size=-1 ><b>Rabin</b></font><br>

<p>In the street where we live there's a place called desire.<br>

There's a stone-cold intrusion of mad man's fire,<br>

But he leaves when the lust and desire released,<br>

And you're left with an empty room in peace.<br>

<p>Saving my heart for you - You do what you want to do<br>

There's a place in my heart for you - This time I'm watching you<br>

Till the blood in my veins run dry - I'll be there to testify<br>

There's a place in my heart for you...<br>

<p>I've been lost in the maze of emotional confound.<br>

I believe that you knew our faith was secure;<br>

How you kept-up your smile with a cool disposition,<br>

How you stuck in the fire with a new sense of reason.<br>

<p>You tell me to take it easy, but it's not my style.<br>

You saw me around the corner; it'll pass you by.<br>

I wanna hold you closer to connect my fortunes.<br>

I wannt take you higher, take it out like we did before.<br>

<p><font size="+2"><a name="7"></a>Miracle of Life</font><sup>(5)</sup><br>

<font size=-1 ><b>Rabin/Mancina</b></font><br>

<p>Hold on to the miracle of life...

<p>Secret lives of oceans been washed away like mud.<br>

You don't want my devotion;<br>

You'd rather be washed in blood.<br>

Can we turn away from this open anger?<br>

Counting all the prey<br>

Don't you feel the danger to the miracle of life.<br>

<p>Sing when open hearts are calling,<br>

Shout with open eyes (To the miracle of life)<br>

Far below the deepest treasure<br>

To the miracle of life<br>

<p>Living in times of luster, waiting for the flood.<br>

We don't agree with your concepts;<br>

You'd rather be washed in blood.<br>

Is it any wonder? (In my lifetime)<br>

Cold depth of blue water...<br>

Is it any wonder? (In my lifetime)<br>

Rising tides of slaughter - shoulda been washed in blood<br>

<p>Sing when open hearts are calling,<br>

Shout with open eyes (To the miracle of life)<br>

Far beyond your deepest pleasure<br>

To the miracle of life<br>

<p>Pacifica...Indian...Atlantica...<br>

<p>Does it matter if He broke His spell?<br>

So unreal is the future life along the way (day to day)<br>

To turn around, it all comes through this feel.<br>

It doesn't ring true.<br>

<p>Silent talking in the system, ringing to this beautiful world.<br>

Silent talking, always dreaming, ringing to this beautiful world.<br>

Silent talking in the system, ringing to this beautiful world.<br>

Silent talking, always dreaming, ringing to this beautiful world.<br>

<font size=-1 ><b>Squire/Sherwood</b></font>

<p>You and I can change the world;<br>

The more we live, the more we learn, the more we know.<br>

From this moment on we share the world;<br>

The more we give, the more we love, the more we grow.<br>

The spirit of imagination can lead us through the dark;<br>

The more we see, the more we try, the more we show.<br>

The evidence of our confusion, life has left its mark;<br>

The more we fear, the more we lie, the more we hide.<br>

<p>As we walk into tomorrow (Turning away from the path we know)<br>

Holding the future with our hands (We carry the weight of the world we go)<br>

It's up to you and I (We hold the key; we hold the answer)<br>

<p>All our thoughts of doubt and fear (We leave it all by one)<br>

The more we live, the more we learn, the more we know.<br>

For each of us the road is clear and life has just begun;<br>

The more we give, the more we love, the more we grow.<br>

It's time to ease the thoughts we set for ourselves;<br>

The more we fear, the more we lie, the more we hide.<br>

All we need is just to believe in ourselves;<br>

We face the truth, we see it clear, with no disguise.<br>

<p>Cast away our doubt and sorrow (Turning away from the past we know)<br>

The Universe and all can be (Showing the fate of the world we know)<br>

Together you and I, we hold the key to all the answers (Let go)<br>

<font size=-1 ><b>Anderson/Wakeman/Elias</b></font><br>

<p>Out of the brightest tree the moon became the morning sun,<br>

And there again reflected on the dreams of everyone.<br>

Out of the starlight night the telling of all our lives,<br>

And racing faster than the Northwestern World.<br>

<p>Starpoint to signal our endlessness<br>

Starpoint to signal this evermore<br>

Starpoint to compass: We look to the North<br>

To return to the centre: Angkor Wat.<br>

<p>(Cambodian poetry; translation follows)<br>

<p>I am a child of the universe.<br>

I deserve total recognition of this in the light of God.<br>

Being a child of the universe,<br>

I want to live in a world without war<br>

I want to live in a world without starvation<br>

I want to live in a world without pestilence<br>

I want to live in a world of love, peace and harmony<br>

Because I am a child of the universe.<br>

<font size=-1 ><b>Anderson/Elias</b></font>

<p>Come into the light, passing through wisdom.<br>

Hoping for love, all at the knees.<br>

You come across; you get too much.<br>

Everybody needs it; don't show your body.<br>

<p>So dangerous - This fear of love<br>

So dangerous - Can you handle it?<br>

So dangerous - To love<br>

So dangerous - Everyone else can do it<br>

<p>Walking the street, you're breaking your love.<br>

Lose your heart, all in a mess.<br>

In the middle of the night, looking for a little<br>

And to the some; don't show your body.<br>

<p>Death defying - Hurt by love<br>

Passing through shadows - Don't lose your body<br>

<p>So dangerous - This fear of love<br>

So dangerous - Can you handle it?<br>

So dangerous - To keep this fear of love<br>

So dangerous - To let it go<br>

<p>I don't imagine I see it; don't get confused.<br>

In the light, through the night...<br>

Look in the light, through the night<br>

Of what you're searching for.<br>

<p>Hide from your heart here in the arms of wanting.<br>

Hide from the dark here in the arms of love.<br>

Run from the fear inside the darkest reaches.<br>

Look to yourself; you'll see the light of fear.<br>

<p>So dangerous - This fear of love<br>

So dangerous - Can you handle it?<br>

So dangerous - To love<br>

So dangerous - Everyone else can do it<br>

So dangerous - Give to the hear of love.<br>

<font size=-1 ><b>Anderson/Elias/Howe</b></font>

<p>/See the searching...<br>

See the people...<br>

<p>Out in the darkness I'm soul searching;<br>

Did you find what we had lost?<br>

All this time I've got to thinking about the promises;<br>

How long this energy of Winter?<br>

How many times could we never love?<br>

How many times is time enough?<br>

<p>All the foolish notions: When we'll die that's all that is.<br>

We can never really understand the broken promises.<br>

All along we run together (Remember?)<br>

All along we run as one (Remember?)<br>

When you find a perfect union, you've got to follow it.<br>

<p>Stop that reason! Get the answer!<br>

You've got to stop that thinking out loud! (Get the answer!)<br>

Go where your heart tells you to (Get the answer!)<br>

You're not that innocent! You've been around!<br>

<p>Got to be right; got it coming to you.<br>

How many times is time enough? (Who we love?)<br>

Your time is just beginning out of all where we came from.<br>

<p>Holding on: This point receiving; there it is!<br>

Holding on: Can you remember?<br>

Holding on: Was it ever like this?<br>

Holding on: It's the most important thing.<br>

<p>It was the first time that I saw you<br>

It was the first time that I knew<br>

Out of all my disbelieving,<br>

Holding on, I was holding you.<br>

Long before it needs to be.<br>

<p>Take the water to the mountain;<br>

Let your body flow upstream.<br>

Let it cascade off your shoulders;<br>

Be the body of your dreams.<br>

<p>Take the water to the mountain;<br>

Let the sun shine on your ground.<br>

You decide your every movement;<br>

Let the water to the land.<br>

Put to Nature all you can give;<br>
