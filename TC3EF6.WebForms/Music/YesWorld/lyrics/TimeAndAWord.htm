<font size="+1"><b>Yes</b></font>

<p>&nbsp;

<p><font size="+2" ><a name="1"></a>No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed*</font><br>

<font size="-1" ><b>Havens</b></font>

<p>Step out in the night<br>

When you're lonely<br>

Listening for the sounds<br>

That your ears don't hear.<br>

I know your cross is heavier<br>

With every step, every step<br>

But I know a man<br>

Who'd walk miles for you.<br>

<br>

Stop! You stay where you are.<br>

Take a look at yourself.<br>

Take a good look at yourself.<br>

Can't tell your mama,<br>

She'd only tell you<br>

That she told you so,<br>

The life you are leading<br>

She won't believe<br>

The real trick of life we all know.<br>

<br>

Dawn turns to day<br>

And the dawning<br>

Daytime Nighttime<br>

And we still can't see<br>

Why must we wait<br>

until the morning light<br>

To wake up and be<br>

To wake up and be<br>

To wake up and be<br>

To wake up and be.<br>

<font size="-1" ><b>Anderson</b></font>

<p>And in a time that's closer, life will be even older then.<br>

Souls will be complicated, life will be consummated then.<br>

Hearts will be brought together soon in our minds forever then.<br>

As long as we see there's only us, who can change it;<br>

Only us to rearrange it at the start of a new kind of day.<br>

And in a time that's closer, life will be even bolder then.<br>

<p>Love is the only answer, hate is the root of cancer then.<br>

Truth is just for the being and is the sight for seeing then.<br>

Thoughts will be thought together soon in our minds forever then.<br>

As long as we see there's only us, who can change it;<br>

Only us to rearrange it at the start of a new kind of day.<br>

And in a time that's closer, life will be even bolder then.<br>

Love is the only answer, hate is the root of cancer then.<br>

Truth is just for the being and is the sight for seeing then.<br>

<p><font size="+2"><a name="3"></a>Everydays**</font><br>

<font size="-1" ><b>Stills</b></font>

<p>Look at the sad goodbyes<br>

Every day's a killing time<br>

Sun coming up outside<br>

No men are born this time<br>

Saturday's child stays home<br>

Nothing to say so long<br>

Well Well Well another day<br>

Well Well well another day.<br>

<br>

Grocery store ten bucks<br>

Just making change for plastic cherries<br>

Up in a tree a Jay Bird looking at me<br>

No word<br>

Everyone looks but can't see.<br>

We can't be ignored so easily<br>

Well Well Well another day<br>

Well Well Well another day.<br>

<br>

Soft within the wayward things<br>

Like ecstasy, the sound of trees,<br>

Most anything, what a baby sees<br>

<br>

Beautiful face all right<br>

Many a place out of sight<br>

Old woman there with red shoes<br>

Four million balloons all used<br>

Drive over hills forget your fear<br>

Getting it out of second gear<br>

Well Well Well another day<br>

Well Well Well another day.<br>

<p>&nbsp;

<p><font size="+2"><a name="4"></a>Sweet Dreams</font><br>

<p>Sweet dreams console the future,<br>

Sweet dreams provide the past.<br>

Sweet things within your make up;<br>

These things will always last,<br>

These things will make<br>

<p>Sweet dreams of conversation,<br>

Sweet dreams of love relation.<br>

Sweet words within your make up;<br>

Sweet words of things to come<br>

Sweet words of things to come<br>

<p>Come on better write your letters,<br>

You know it will be better anyhow.<br>

You're gonna laugh again,<br>

You're gonna smile again,<br>

You're gonna love again.<br>

<p>Sweet dreams are born inside you,<br>

Sweet dreams are born to last.<br>

Sweet thoughts within your make up;<br>

These thoughts will always last,<br>

<p><font size="+2"><a name="5"></a>The Prophet</font><br>

<font size="-1" ><b>Anderson/Squire</b></font>

<p>Long ago a tall man told a tale of yesterday,<br>

Searching for the truth to life and not for just the way.<br>

Finding pleasure from the sounds his ears, they did obey;<br>

In his life a moment's pleasure, never to delay.<br>

<p>He was lost and in his trust he found a new meaning;<br>

Seeing things in diff'rent lights his life was redeeming.<br>

<p>Words of peace would fill his mind and change his way of life;<br>

Peaceful meetings with his heart have made him more alive.<br>

Meeting wise old women on the cliffs of life itself;<br>

Asking more for first meaning, more for just himself.<br>

<br>

Soon we'll be as he proclaimed in a new way of living;<br>

Take the things you need in life but remember the giving.<br>

<p>Prophesy within your mind and you will work it out;<br>

Prophesy that some will die but only those who doubt.<br>

Then you'll never worry as somtimes you used to do;<br>

Just remember when you're gone there's someone after you, you.<br>

<p>&nbsp;

<p><font size="+2"><a name="6"></a>Clear Days</font><br>

<font size="-1" ><b>Anderson</b></font>

<p>I once knew a sweet young girl;<br>

Her body was her world and love,<br>

Her laughter was as happiness is.<br>

Of all the times I treasure this.<br>

And on a day we will remember,<br>

On a clear day we will love forever.<br>

<p>I once knew a sweet young dream,<br>

That if life itself were all we had<br>

Then who are we to ask for more;<br>

Let's not be sad, let's all be sure.<br>

And on a day we will remember,<br>

On a clear day we'll all be together,<br>

Together.<br>

<p>&nbsp;

<p><font size="+2"><a name="7"></a>Astral Traveller</font><br>

<font size="-1" ><b>Anderson</b></font><br>

<p>And in the ruins of the balloon<br>

Stood a man with glasses held high,<br>

Wandering when to do it again <br>

Have another fly into the sky,<br>

Somewhere flying high.<br>

<p>Astral traveller,<br>

Leaving without her,<br>

Wondering where lights go;<br>

Leave out the body load.<br>

<p>Once in the air, people who dare<br>

Get great respect in being.<br>

(Astral traveller.)<br>

Heavenly flight wondrous night<br>

And all the sights worth seeing,<br>

Just believe in.<br>

<p>Astral traveller,<br>

Leaving without her,<br>

Wondering where lights go;<br>

Leave out the body load.<br>

<p>&nbsp;

<p><font size="+2"><a name="8"></a>Time And A Word</font><br>

<font size="-1" >Anderson/Foster</font><br>

<p>In the morning when you rise,<br>

Do you open up your eyes, see what I see?<br>

Do you see the same things ev'ry day?<br>

<br>

Do you think of a way to start the day<br>

Getting things in proportion?<br>

Spread the news and help the world go 'round.<br>

<br>

Have you heard of a time that will help us get it together again?<br>

Have you heard of the word that will stop us going wrong?<br>

Well, the time is near the word you'll hear<br>

When you get things in perspective.<br>

Spread the news and help the word go round.<br>

<p>There's a time and the time is now and it's right for me,<br>

It's right for me, and the time is now.<br>

There's a word and the word is love and it's right for me,<br>

It's right for me, and the word is love.<br>

<p>Have you heard of a time that will help get it together again?<br>

Have you heard of the word that will stop us going wrong?<br>

Well, the time is near and the word you'll hear<br>

When you get things in perspective.<br>

Spread the news and help the word go round.<br>

<p>There's a time and the time is now and it's right for me,<br>

It's right for me, and the time is now.<br>

There's a word and the word is love and it's right for me,<br>

It's right for me, and the word is love.<br>

There's a time and the time is now and it's right for me,<br>

It's right for me, and the time is now.<br>

There's a word and the word is love and it's right for me,<br>

It's right for me, and the word is love.
