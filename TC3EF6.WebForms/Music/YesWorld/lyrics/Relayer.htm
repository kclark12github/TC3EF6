  <p><font size="+2" face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial" ><a name="1"></a>The Gates 
    of Delirium</font><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial"><br>
    <font size=-1 arial><b>Anderson/Howe/Moraz/Squire/White</b></font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Stand and fight we do consider<br>
    Reminded of an inner pact between us<br>
    That's seen as we go<br>
    And ride there<br>
    In motion<br>
    To fields in debts of honor<br>
    Defending</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Stand the marchers soaring talons,<br>
    Peaceful lives will not deliver freedom,<br>
    Fighting we know,<br>
    Destroy oppression<br>
    The point to reaction<br>
    As leaders look to you<br>
    Attacking</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Choose and renounce throwing chains to 
    the floor.<br>
    Kill or be killing faster sins correct the flow.<br>
    Casting giant shadows off vast penetrating force<br>
    To alter via the war that seen<br>
    As friction spans the spirits wrath ascending (slowly) to redeem.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Wars that shout in screams of anguish,<br>
    Power spent passion bespoils our soul receiver,<br>
    Surely we know.<br>
    In glory<br>
    We rise to offer,<br>
    Create our freedom,<br>
    A word we utter,<br>
    A word.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Words cause our banner, victorious our 
    day.<br>
    Will silence be promised as violence display?<br>
    The curse increased we fight the power<br>
    And live by it by day.<br>
    Our gods awake in thunderous roars,<br>
    And guide the leaders' hand in paths of glory to the cause.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Listen, should we fight forever<br>
    Knowing as we do know fear destroys?<br>
    Listen, should we leave our children?<br>
    Listen, our lives stare in silence;<br>
    Help us now.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Listen, your friends have been broken,<br>
    They tell us of your poison; now we know.<br>
    Kill them, give them as they give us.<br>
    Slay them, burn their childrens' laughter<br>
    On to hell.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">The fist will run, grasp metal to gun.<br>
    The spirit sings in crashing tones,<br>
    We gain the battle drum.<br>
    Our cries will shrill, the air will moan and crash into the dawn.<br>
    The pen won't stay the demon's wings,<br>
    The hour approaches pounding out the Devil's sermon.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Soon, oh soon the light,<br>
    Pass within and soothe this endless night<br>
    And wait here for you,<br>
    Our reason to be here.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Soon, oh soon the time,<br>
    All we move to gain will reach and calm;<br>
    Our heart is open,<br>
    Our reason to be here.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Long ago, set into rhyme.<br>
    Soon, oh soon the light,<br>
    Ours to shape for all time,<br>
    Ours the right;<br>
    The sun will lead us,<br>
    Our reason to be here.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Faster moment spent spread tales of change 
    within the sound,<br>
    Counting form through rhythm electric freedom<br>
    Moves to counter-balance stars expound our conscience<br>
    All to know and see the look in your eyes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Passing time will reach as nature relays 
    to set the scene,<br>
    New encounters spark a true fruition,<br>
    Guiding lines we touch them, our bodies balance out the waves<br>
    As we accelerate our days to the look in your eyes.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">From the moment I reached out to hold, 
    I felt a sound,<br>
    And what touches our soul slowly moves as touch rebounds.<br>
    And to know that tempo will continue<br>
    Lost in trance of dances as rhythm takes another turn,<br>
    As is my want, I only reach to look in your eyes.</font></p>

    <font size=-1 arial><b>Anderson/Howe/Squire/Moraz/White</b></font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">We go sailing down the calming streams,<br>
    Drifting endlessly by the bridge.<br>
    To be over, we will see, to be over.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Do not suffer through the game of chance 
    that plays;<br>
    Always doors to lock away your dreams.<br>
    Think it over, time will heal your fear, think it over.<br>
    Balance the thoughts that release within you.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Childlike soul dreamer.<br>
    One journey, one to seek and see in every light<br>
    Do open true pathways away.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Carrying closer,<br>
    Go gently, holding doors will open every way<br>
    You wander true pathways away.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">After all your soul will still surrender.<br>
    After all don't doubt your part,<br>
    Be ready to be loved. </font></p>
