  We'll marry our fortunes together<br>
  I've got some real estate here in my bag<br>
  So we bought a pack of cigarettes<br>
  And Mrs. Wagner's pies<br>
  And walked off to look for America</font></p>

Playing games with the faces<br>
She said the man in the Gabardine suit<br>
Was a spy<br>
I said &quot;Be careful, his bow tie is really a camera&quot;</font></p>

<font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Here are the books of look;<br>
You need them to open the seed<br>
To see what goes on in the world<br>
Here in my mind<br>
Catch the wind and hold on tight<br>
To what we'll find<br>
And hear what goes on in the world<br>
Here is all you see<br>
Everything is made for you from me</font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">If there's anything you'd like to say
that could help me in any way<br>
Cause I've been waiting for so long for you to come along<br>
Help me on that day<br>
When you take over all the things heaven has made for you<br>
Is there anything you think you should know<br>
Is there anything before I go?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Dear Father (repeat)<br>
I'm hungry, I'm cold<br>
Feeling terribly old<br>
I don't think I can see<br>
I'm not feeling good like I think I should</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">They're on their own, needing a face, a
place,<br>
Hope and mind, a home<br>
To see what goes on in the world<br>
They're who you need<br>
To show them why they're wrong, oh why indeed<br>
We need to go on in the world<br>
Here is all you see<br>
Everything is made for you from me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">If there's any complication that you'd
like to talk over with me about<br>
'Cause I've been waiting for so long for you to come along<br>
We can work it all out<br>
When you take over all the things heaven has made for you<br>
Is there anything you think you should know<br>
Is there anything before I go?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Dear Father (repeat)<br>
You must be putting me on<br>
'Cause most of their minds are gone<br>
They run on T'understand me<br>
I'm not feeling good like I think I should</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Dear Father (repeat)<br>
Can I give it a miss<br>
'Cause I'm not ready for this<br>
I don't think I can see<br>
I'm not feeling good like I think I should</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Dear Father (repeat)<br>
Won't you leave me alone<br>
Won't you let me go home<br>
I don't think I could see<br>
Lord, they'd crucify me<br>
I just couldn't do that<br>
'Cause that's not where it's at now.</font></p>
