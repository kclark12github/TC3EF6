In the fountains of the Universe		:	Set time in accord
Sits the boychild Solomon			:	Ever turning round and round
In the cities of the Southern Sky		:	Set points Universe
Dreams he of glory				:	Pulsating round and round
Future times will stand and clearly see	:	Highest dancing
Of the course of innocence			:	Drifting drifting

		See it all
		See it all
		Till tomorrow
		See it all
		See it all
		Till tomorrow

Future times will stand and clearly smile
Of the course of innocence

Dantalion will ride again			:	Raging forth underland
The course of evils standing straight		:	Grind to grind
Hot metal will abound the land		:	Churning out shout
As the form regards our blazing hand
Future times will stand and clearly see
Of the course of innocence 
One the word will enter all our hearts
Two the duel will alter them

Three jewels countenance divine away delight away
Four the fight to free the land
Five the islands of Arabia
Six the tears that separate
Six the tears that separate

Rejoice forward out this feeling 
Ten true summers long
We go round and round and round and round
Until we pick it up again
Time flies, on and on it goes
Thru the setting sun
Carry round and round and round and round
Until it comes to carry you home

Rejoice forward out this feeling
The white eagle soars
He goes round and round and round
Until the early winds of change
Dawns new light conquering timeless ease

Spread the harvest breeze
Let our hour of passion
Gently hold our heads on high with you
Gently hold our heads on high

You're first        I'm last
You're thirst       I'm asked to justify
Killing our last heaven beast
Don't hunt the whale

In beauty           Vision
Do we               Offer much
If we reason with destiny, gonna lose our touch
Don't kill the whale

Rejoice             They sing
They worship their own space
In a moment of love, they will die for their grace
Don't kill the whale

If time will allow
We will judge all who came
In the wake of our new age to stand for the frail
Don't kill the whale

I will be there said my friend of a distant life
Covered in greens of a golden age, set in stone
Follow me "he sounded of dreams supreme" follow me
Drifting within the glow and the after-glow of the eve
And if that firelight, I could match the inner flame
Sacred ships do sail the seventh age

Cast off your garments of fear, replace them with love
Most of all play with the game of the age
Highest of places remain all as one with you
Giving us light and the freedom of the day

And if that firelight, I could match the inner flame
Sacred ships do sail the seventh age
And have always been here

Celestial travelers have always been here with us
Set in the homes of the Universe we have yet to go
Countless expansions will arrive and flow inside of us
My friend, he of fantasy, dancing with the spirit of the age

Have you heard before, hit it out, don't look back
Rock is the medium of our generation
Stand for every right, kick it out, hear you shout
For the right of all of creation

We've heard before, but we just don't seem to move
The pressure's on is there lack of concentration

Power defy our needs, lift us up, show us now
Show us how amid the rack of confusion
Drive in thoughts of high, satisfy, in a plan
Set it out for all to understand it

We've heard before, but we just don't seem to move
The pressure's on is there lack of concentration

Lost and wondering, maybe, how it is
Seems to me, it's as simple as this
No matter, where you go, you're going to find
You won't see me in front, but you can't leave me behind

Power at first to the needs of each others days
Simple to lose in the void sounds of anarchy's calling ways
All unaccounted for in the craziness of power
In the craziness
Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your brother
Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your sister
Release, release, enough controllers
Show some signs of appreciated loyalties
Release, release, enough controllers
Show some signs of appreciated loyalties

Straight jacket, freedom's march, is it all, far beyond
Our reason of understanding
Campaign everything, anti-right, anti-left
Anticipate the love of creation
Stand for every right
Kick it out, hear you shout
Further the right
Further the right
Further the light
Of all of creation

Power at first to the needs of each other's days
Simple to lose in the void of anarchy's calling ways
All unaccounted for in the craziness of power
In the craziness
Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your brother
Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your sister
Release, release
Release, release
Release, release
Release, release

I could not take it oh so seriously really
When you called and said you'd seen a UFO
But then it dawned on me the message in writing
Spelt out a meeting never dreamed of before

I looked out, in the night
Strange and startling
Was the voice of time just saying
There's got to be a linking of everyone
Got to be a centre
It all comes flooding back

Arriving thru the eons of times immortal power of the future to behold
Vessels of a different impression, none that we could ever hope to have known

So look out, in the night
Once they arrive
Oh that perennial light
Impress a bolder Empire of Energy
In the ships we see
The coming of outer space

You say there's no reason to conjure
With the force as it has been known to be seen
You say I'm a fool a believer
Put your feet on the earth it is green

But look out, in the night
Wait for they arrive
To start such sciences anew
Here it is the coming of outer space
Such a pure delight
The coming of outer space

<font size=-1 ><b>Anderson</b></font>

<pre><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial" size=3>
The day the Circus of Heaven came to town
Local folks lined the streets in a Midwestern town
Waiting anxiously for the parade to begin all round
On the very last day

A Unicorn headed the Mystical way

Surrounded by what seemed a thousand golden angels at play
Behind were Centaurs, elves, bright fairies all in colours of Jade
On the very final day

For what seemed only just a moment in time
Seven solemn flying silvered regal horses rode by
Seven golden chariots in tow, a wonder to behold
The Seven Lords of the Mountains of time

There then arose where nothing really stood there before
A giant tent rising one thousand feet high from the floor
Towns people flocked inside with their eyes all amazed
To greet the Seventh Lord of the Seventh age

A fanfare rang out in an incredible sound
Bringing out the strangest visions perfect harmony round
Any dreams he asked would they like to have seen
From historical or mythical scenes

Then there above their heads just as vivid as life
Each vision transported in multitudes inventing light
Grecian galleons, The Sack of Troy, to the Gardens of Babylon
A play of millions roared along

The gigantic dreams of Alexander the Great
Civil wars where brothers fought and killed their friendship in hate
All seen by Zeus performing scenes of the magical way
The day the circus came to town

Outside great animals as tame as the trees
Angels high in starlight dancing streets
Tuning their colours with indigo and gold
Dropping violet, red and emerald snow
As the circus finally changed its invisible course
A new world to be found

On the dreamy ground we walked upon
I turned to my son and said
"Was that something beautiful, amazing, wonderful, extraordinary beautiful?"
"Oh! it was OK!! But there were no clowns, no tigers, lions or bears,
candy-floss, toffee apples, no clowns."

Contained in everything I do
There's a love, I feel for you
Proclaimed in everything I write
You're the light
Burning, brightly

Onward through the night
Onward through the night
Onward through the night of my life

Displayed in all the things I see
There's a love you show to me
Portrayed in all the things you say
You're the day
Leading the way

Onward through the night
Onward through the night
Onward through the night of my life

Onward through the night
Onward through the night
Onward through the night of my life

On the silent wings of Freedom
Where I offer myself midst the balancing of the Sun
On the winds of Celestial Seasons
That would carry me on, midst the balance of being one
On the dream of our love Eternal
That will eventually bring our living once more with you

                        Where we are coming from
                        Or where we go
                        We only know we come with sound
     
                        Where we are coming from
                        Or where we go
                        We only know we go around and round
               
On the back of your forty-second screamdown
Do you choose to be lost midst the challenge of being one
On the flight of regardless feelings
As you hurtle to fear midst the challenge of everyone

On the darkest night so painful
Do you hunger for love midst the torture of being one
On the passing light of Easing
Have you seen you inside midst the being of Everyone
To the common goal of Freedom
Where we offer ourselves midst the balancing of the Sun

                        Where we are coming from
                        Or where we go
                        We only know we come with sound
                
                        Where we are coming from
                        Or where we go
                        We only know we go around and round
