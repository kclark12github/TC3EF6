<p>Move yourself<br>

You always live your life<br>

Never thinking of the future<br>

Prove yourself<br>

You are the move you make<br>

Take your chances win or loser<br>

<p>See yourself<br>

You are the steps you take<br>

You and you - and that's the only way<br>

<br>

Shake - shake yourself<br>

You're every move you make<br>

So the story goes<br>

<p>Owner of a lonely heart<br>

Owner of a lonely heart<br>

Much better than - a<br>

Owner of a broken heart<br>

Owner of a lonely heart<br>

<p>Say - you don't want to chance it<br>

You've been hurt so before<br>

<p>Watch it now<br>

The eagle in the sky<br>

How he dancin' one and only<br>

You - lose yourself<br>

No not for pity's sake<br>

There's no real reason to be lonely<br>

Be yourself<br>

Give your free will a chance<br>

You've got to want to succeed<br>

<p>Owner of a lonely heart<br>

Owner of a lonely heart<br>

Much better than - a<br>

Speak when you are spoken to<br>

Don't pretend you're right<br>

This life's not for living<br>

It's for fighting and for war<br>

No matter what the truth is<br>

Hold on to what is yours<br>

<p>Jigsaw puzzle traitors<br>

Set to spill the beans<br>

Shattering the dreams<br>

Blood flows in the desert<br>

This one is strictly for you<br>

Such platonic eye<br>

How they drown in incomplete capacity<br>

Strangest of them all<br>

When the feeling calls<br>

How we drown in stylistic audacity<br>

Charge the common ground<br>

Round and round and round<br>

We living in gravity<br>

<p>Shake - We shake so hard<br>

How we laugh so loud<br>

When we reach<br>

We believe in eternity<br>

<p>I'm moving through some changes<br>

I'll never be the same<br>

Something you did touched me<br>

There's no one else to blame<br>

<p>The love we had has fallen<br>

The love we used to share<br>

We've given up pretending<br>

As if you didn't care<br>

<p>Change changing places<br>

Root yourself to the ground<br>

Capitalize on this good fortune<br>

One word can bring you round<br>

Changes<br>

<p>I look into the mirror<br>

I see no happiness<br>

All the warmth I gave you<br>

Has turned to emptiness<br>

The love we had has fallen<br>

The love we used to share<br>

You've left me here believing<br>

In love that wasn't there<br>

<p>Change changing places<br>

Root yourself to the ground<br>

Word to the wise - Well you get what's coming<br>

One word can bring you round<br>

Changes<br>

<p>When I look into your eyes and try to 

find out how<br>

There's no way to save it now<br>

And everything I feel<br>

Changes<br>

Keep looking for<br>

Changes<br>

Changes<br>

<p>For some reason you're questioning why<br>

I always believe it gets better<br>

One difference between you and I<br>

Your heart is inside your head<br>

<p>One word from you<br>

One word from me<br>

A clear design on your liberty<br>

Who could believe when love has gone<br>

How we move on like everyone<br>

<p>Only such fools<br>

Only such jealous hearts<br>

<p>Only through love changes come<br>

<p>Change changing places<br>

Root yourself to the ground<br>

Capitalize on this good fortune<br>

One word can bring you round<br>

Changes<br>

<p>One road to loneliness<br>

It's always the same<br>

One road to happiness<br>

It's calling your name<br>

<p>Change changing places - Changes<br>

Root yourself to the ground<br>

Capitalize on this good fortune<br>

One word can bring you round<br>

Changes<br>

<p>Change changing places<br>

Changes<br>

Root yourself to the ground<br>

Word to the wise - Well you get what's coming<br>

One word - One word can bring you round<br>

<font size=-1><b>Anderson/Squire/Rabin/White</b></font><br>

<p>Toledo was just another good stop<br>

Along the good king's highway<br>

My fortification took me by surprise<br>

And hit me sending me sideways<br>

Spellbound - Roundly - Good for sunshine<br>

Can't help thinking<br>

<p>Singing Rule Britannia<br>

And this is where it grabs you<br>

There's method in the key of C<br>

Toledo's got to be the silver city<br>

In this good country<br>

<p>Our song<br>

It gives us a reason<br>

Our song<br>

That good remedy<br>

Music has magic<br>

That stuff of syncopation<br>

<p>Ever tried driving it to golden heights<br>

Just simply jiving it<br>

My mystification it got a<br>

Jewel skies crazy spacing it<br>

Hot sun - Crowded - Screams high voices<br>

Singing speechless<br>

<p>Touching of the healing heart<br>

So this is where we really start<br>

Music is a shout of foregone conclusions<br>

As long as music plays its part<br>

Good good part<br>

<p>Our song<br>

It gives us a reason<br>

Our song<br>

That good remedy<br>

Music has magic<br>

It's good clear syncopation<br>

<p>Treat it good<br>

Treat it rightly<br>

And if you get it flowing<br>

The harmony is glowing<br>

So get ready<br>

So get ready<br>

Don't go toledo toledo don't go<br>

Music - Good to you<br>

Music - Good to you<br>

No - No regrets at all<br>

Justice - Body smooth take over<br>

Good girls they work the city<br>

Good guys they spike you hard<br>

How they jive and jingle<br>

When you're in their backyard<br>

<p>Street corner wonder lust<br>

Beckoning the good guy<br>

Take this get that<br>

Have a good time<br>

<p>He young and tactile<br>

He ready for anything that is<br>

How they jive and jingle<br>

They've read the book that gives<br>

<p>We'll be waiting for the night<br>

We'll be waiting for the night to come<br>

<p>We'll be waiting for the night<br>

We'll be waiting for the night to come<br>

<p>Supervise this good treatment<br>

Alternative line by line<br>

So the street guys so observant<br>

Take him for a ride<br>

Have a good time<br>

Like a legend the man he sharp<br>

His women gladly watching<br>

As he strides out of the dark<br>

Better be quick get away<br>

<p>We'll be waiting for the night<br>

We'll be waiting for the night to come<br>

<p>We'll be waiting for the night<br>

We'll be waiting for the night to come<br>

<p>Good timing has its good price<br>

One trick and you're stuck with the dice<br>

How they jive and jingle<br>

When you're their sacrifice<br>

<p>Fast as lightning<br>

Go - Go get high - He's looking good<br>

Once bitten twice shy<br>

No woman no cry<br>

No woman don't cry<br>
