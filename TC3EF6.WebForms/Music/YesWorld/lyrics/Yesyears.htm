    narrated by Rick Wakeman:</i></font></p>
  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Good evening and 
    welcome to a party satirical broadcast <br>
    On behalf of the Labour Party, your Chancellor of the Exchecker, Dennis Healey<br>
    <br>
    Money comes and money goes'. <br>
    Taxes are high and incomes low, <br>
    But you see they don't worry me, <br>
    You see it doesn't worry me at all, <br>
    It doesn't worry anybody actually. </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example there's 
    an accountant called David Moss, <br>
    He's an absolute fucking disaster, <br>
    But he don't worry me. <br>
    In fact he worried some people in the Yes group. <br>
    And a few others.... not me, you see, <br>
    You've all been silly billies, <br>
    Complaining about high taxation, <br>
    But I can tell you quite categorically, <br>
    That taxation has never been a problem for me or<br>
    Michael Foot - please stop eating those baked beans! <br>
    Try and deal with this immigration problem. <br>
    Do please, I can't stand it, you see the nig nogs come and the rock stars 
    go, <br>
    Jobs get less and dole queues grow, <br>
    They don't worry me. </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But let's be fair, 
    you see I am alright, <br>
    You're all in really a very difficult situation, <br>
    But it don't seem to worry me at all. <br>
    Now let's have a close look at the financial situation in the country and 
    the home, <br>
    And let's face the facts, <br>
    I've been up to the North of England, <br>
    I hear all the trouble's meant to be, <br>
    And for those who are working, things are easy,<br>
    And I'm convinced I'm the man who put the second four letters in the word 
    Scunthorpe. <br>
    You see a very good friend of mine, <br>
    Who was once a PM - <br>
    Well, we'll call him the PM, <br>
    He's the Prime Minister, he said, <br>
    Screw anything you can, and I'm trying to do that now with the country. </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You see the Tories 
    said 'The housewife has never had it so good' <br>
    Well I can tell you quite categorically that my wife said she's never had 
    it!<br>
    Barbara Castle in fact has tried to look at all inflationary things on the 
    backbench <br>
    Well she looked at me, I know! <br>
    In fact next week she's going to Bangkok. <br>
    Do you feel inflation in your pocket? <br>
    I know I do and I'm convinced that Pan's People are at the root of my problem<br>
    My main problem these days is that I just can't get a root! <br>
    And so ends my party satirical broadcast on behalf of the Labour Party</font></i></p>
