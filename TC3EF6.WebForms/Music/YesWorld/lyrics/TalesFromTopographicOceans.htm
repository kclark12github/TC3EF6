    The Revealing Science of God can be seen as an ever-opening flower in which 
    simple truths emerge examining the complexities and magic of the past and 
    how we should not forget the song that has been left to us to hear. The knowledge 
    of God is a search, constant and clear.</i></font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dawn of light lying between 
    a silence and sold sources,<br>
    Chased amid fusions of wonder, in moments hardly seen forgotten,<br>
    Coloured in pastures of chance dancing leaves cast spells of challenge,<br>
    Amused but real in thought, we fled from the sea whole.<br>
    Dawn of thought transfered through moments of days undersearching earth<br>
    Revealing corridors of time provoking memories, disjointed but with purpose,<br>
    Craving penetrations offer links with the self instructors sharp<br>
    And tender love as we took to the air, a picture of distance.<br>
    Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused<br>
    Expression, as only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing<br>
    Late into corners, and we danced from the ocean.<br>
    Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many<br>
    Won't to follow, only tunes of a different age.<br>
    As the links span our endless caresses for the freedom of life everlasting.<br>
    </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Talk to the sunlight caller<br>
    Soft summer mover distance mine.<br>
    </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Called out a tune but 
    I never saw the face<br>
    Heard but not replaced<br>
    I ventured to talk, but I never lost my place<br>
    Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day<br>
    Lost in lights array<br>
    I ventured to see, as the sound began to play<br>
    </font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What happened to this 
    song we once knew so well<br>

    The light we were as one<br>
    And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun</font> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And for a moment when 
    our world had filled the skies<br>
    Magic turned our eyes<br>
    To feast on the treasure set for our strange device</font>

    not mean<br>
    Or so it seems so clearly<br>
    Sheltered with our passion<br>
    Clearly to be home<br>
    They move fast, they tell me,<br>
    But I just can't believe they really mean to<br>
    There's someone, to tell you,<br>
    And I just can't believe our song will leave you<br>

    Send out poison<br>
    Cast iron leader<br>

    of moving slowly<br>
    Sent through the rhythm work out the story<br>

    Old people feel it, that's what they're saying.<br>

    Getting over wars we do not mean<br>
    We charm the movement suffers<br>
    Call out all our memories<br>
    Clearly to be home<br>

    we'll process the future, but only through him we know, send flowered rainbows<br>
    Apiece apart chased flowers of the dark and lights of songs to follow and 
    show all we feel for and know of<br>
    Cast round<br>
    You seekers of the truth accepting that reason will relive and breath and

    The Remembering. All our thoughts, impressions, knowledge, fears, have been 
    developing for millions of years. What we can relate to is our own past, our 
    own life, our own history. Here, it is especially Rick's keyboards which bring 
    alive the ebb and flow and depth of our mind's eye; the topographic ocean. 
    Hopefully we should appreciate that given points in time are not so significant 
    as the nature of what is impressed on the mind, and how it is retained and 
    used.</i></font>
