<p>



Don't forget to seek out the world that you want to stake out<br>



Actions speak much louder than words<br>



And you get to realize <br>



Just as long as you have control, holding the fire<br>



Just as long as you keep control, this point of your desire<br>



Wait as it will all come to you<br>



Feel it as a mutual response<br>



You get the heaven you like<br>



You get the heaven<br>



You get the heaven you need<br>



You get to heaven now<br>



Just as long as you bring the power from the inside<br>



Just as long as you hold the key from the inside<br>



Ascend and create<br>



Ascend and create<br>



Ascension<br>



<br>



They will bring you rain<br>



They will move the sky<br>



They will give you light<br>



It will live you long<br>



Thru' the eyes of child<br>



Through the song of songs<br>



It will bring the moon <br>



It will transfer you<br>



Whole, pushing for the time to call<br>



Dancing on the moon, giving it out<br>



<br>



In the night of nights<br>



It will shine for you<br>



With the wings of flight<br>



They will make it thru'<br>



Through the eyes of child and the test of song<br>



It will comfort you <br>



It will make you feel<br>



Whole, looking for the chance to call<br>



Making your world, independently<br>



Whole, watching for the place to run<br>



Dancing, dancing, move<br>



<br>



We will make it right <br>



We will dance for you<br>



On this night of nights<br>



They will make it thru'<br>



Through the eyes of child and the wish you are<br>



As the thought that comes from a distant star<br>



Whatever thought you have<br>



Can become a new dream<br>



For the perfect stance<br>



Take you there and back again<br>



And you believe you are<br>



Independently, Whole<br>



Waiting for the signs, Whole<br>



Reaching for the foresight shown <br>



Whole, dancing for the moon, dancing for the light<br>



Whole, pushing for the mind drive, drive<br>



Dancing for the Earth, dancing for the light<br>



Whole<br>



Dancing for the light<br>



<br>



They will bring the rain<br>



They will make it right<br>



It will transfer you, each and every night<br>



With their wings of hope, they will cover you<br>



They will make it right, they will shine for you<br>



With their golden wings, close around your soul<br>



It will count for you, it will make you whole<br>



Thru' the eyes of child, and the song of songs<br>



It will make you move, it will transfer you<br>



<br>



And so it comes to this now<br>



When you walk into the bliss that<br>



Holds down the fire <br>



As pleasure will devine<br>



So close so let your heart enter<br>



So come and let your heart enter this<br>



So close and let yourself lose control<br>



Heaven help the love that you send<br>



Heaven has the love you send, free<br>



<br>



Whole, watching for the time to call<br>



Dancing in the light, making it right<br>



Dancing, dancing, whole<br>



Waiting for the signs, whole<br>



Reaching for the sight to show<br>



Whole, independently, whole<br>



Pushing for the mind drive, drive<br>



Dancing on the Earth, dancing in the light<br>



<br>



They will bring the rain, they will shine the light<br>



Understanding this, it can come tonight<br>



For the love of love and the answers to<br>



It begins with me, it begins with you<br>



Whole, pushing for the time to call<br>



Looking for the sign, making it right<br>



Dancing, dancing, whole<br>



Waiting for the time to call<br>



Dancing in the harmless sun<br>



Entering the mind drive<br>



<br>



Don't forget to seek out the world that you want to stake out<br>



Actions speak much louder than words<br>



And you get to realise <br>



Just as long as you have control, holding the fire<br>



Just as long as you get to keep, this point of your desire<br>



Wait as it will come to you<br>



Feel it as a mutual response<br>



You get the heaven you like<br>



You get to heaven<br>



You get the heaven you need<br>



You get to heaven now</font><br>

<br>



Looking for the mystery in the woman<br>



Dancing with the teacher in the circle<br>



Watching for the reasons we are going<br>



Getting ready for the big bang<br>



Everybody looking for that great connection<br>



Somebody help me find that universal dream<br>



Everybody watching, is something happening<br>



See what I mean<br>



<br>



Looking for the real man<br>



Looking for the teacher<br>



Dancing with the circle<br>



Looking for the real world<br>



Everybody knows where we're going to<br>



Don't forget to leave good footprints behind<br>



Never let the grass grow over your soul<br>



Only time will tell, leave good footprints behind<br>



<br>



I have seen the way <br>



The way is clear to save your love<br>



High upon the sky<br>



The forces come to break you free<br>

Forgiving is what you have<br>

<p>This state in the matrix of the real world thinking<br>



This way is meant to surface through the 'net<br>



This train is set to mystify<br>



This day in the history of the future<br>



This train is set to justify<br>



Whether you're ready or not<br>



This day is of the meeting now<br>



<br>



If they don't give us the keys how are we supposed to get ready?<br>



If they don't give us the keys how are we to survive?<br>



Cover me up and bring me to the power<br>



Cover me up and bring me to the power<br>



Cover me up and bring me to the power<br>



<br>



All I know is all I want to give you<br>



<br>



Cover me up get closer to the fire<br>



Cover me up get closer to the power<br>



Cover me up get closer to the power<br>



Cover me up get closer now<br>



Cover me up get closer to the power<br>



<br>



God talk<br>



God talk, now, talk<br>



God talk<br>



Give a little-ation<br>



God talk, revelation<br>



God talk, revelation<br>



<br>



If they don't give 'em the keys<br>



If we don't give 'em the keys<br>



How are they supposed to be ready<br>



If we don't give 'em the keys<br>



How are they to divine<br>



If we don't give 'em the keys<br>



How are they supposed to be ready<br>



If we don't give 'em the keys<br>



How are they to survive<br>



Cover me up and bring me to the power<br>



Cover me up and bring me revelation<br>



<br>



If we don't give 'em the keys<br>



How are they supposed to be ready<br>



If you don't give 'em the keys<br>



How are they to survive<br>



The power of love can open every heart in everyone<br>



Minute by minute...........<br>

<p><b>Children of Light******</b></font><br>



<font size="-1"><b>Anderson/Vangelis/Squire</b></font><br>



<p>Distant as the distant thunder<br>



Where equal rights will rent asunder<br>



Equal rights for equal people<br>



A disregard for loves equality<br>



Bringing back the signs to no mans land <br>



Where diamonds and gold in hand <br>



Will barter as the homeless burn<br>



Someday will it be our turn<br>



<br>



Why this consciousness, this desire, to expand the flame of revolution<br>



With your public hand of fire, persecution, blood letting and spinning pain<br>



<br>



Why this hungry media delivery<br>



Questions answers plus forgivers<br>



Billions of racial inequalities<br>



We all are one, all are sacred<br>



Be the birth of a nation<br>



Stop this aggrevation<br>



So uninspired as to question imagine humanity<br>



And lack of love for his cosmic guard<br>



<br>



Children of light don't be afraid<br>



Children of light haven't you heard<br>



Gone are the days in black and white<br>



Children of light don't be afraid<br>



<br>



Distant as the distant thunder<br>



Where equal rights will rent asunder<br>



Equal rights for equal people<br>



A disregard for loves equality<br>



Bringing back the signs to no mans land <br>



Where diamonds and gold in hand <br>



Will barter as the homeless burn<br>



Someday will it be our turn<br>



Someday will it be our turn<br>



Someday will it be our turn<br>



<br>



Children of light don't be afraid<br>



Children of light haven't you heard<br>



Gone are the days in black and white<br>



Children of light don't be afraid</font><br>
