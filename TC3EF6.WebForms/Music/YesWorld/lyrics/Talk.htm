<p>Note: The following poem, written by Jon, appeared in the Japanese issue of Talk:

<blockquote><p><font size=2><i>I AM WAITING for the first time, to hear THE CALLING and renew this STATE OF PLAY within; at last to begin so 

that the REAL LOVE behind the WALLS do shine again: and WHERE WILL YOU BE 

out stretched in wonder full BLUEPRINT of your heart seeing me again in this 

SILENT SPRING-Ready and willing yourself at last to TALK to the light within 

your heart and open the magic inside this ENDLESS DREAM. Take your time for 

you are light. Love and peace, Yes. </i></font></blockquote>

<p><font size="+2"><a name="1"></a>The Calling**</font><br>

<font size=-1 arial><b>Rabin/Anderson/Squire</b></font>

<p>Feel the calling of a miracle<br>

In the presence of the word.<br>

Now we hold the right to rearrange<br>

How the stories can be heard.<br>

<p>In the beginning is the future,<br>

And the future is at hand;<br>

I'll be calling voices of Africa<br>

Be the rhythm to the plan.<br>

<p>From the Congo to Lenasia<br>

Be the writing on the wall.<br>

I'll be calling the colors of India<br>

See the Asian life explode.<br>

<p>Head in to the headlight.<br>

Don't turn from the rain.<br>

There's a fire raging somewhere near,<br>

Like a longtime friend who's<br>

Seen it darker than ebony.<br>

Take off on the turnpike<br>

(Asking for the first call)<br>

Give me more of the same<br>

(Asking for a song)<br>

There's a fire burning in my heart again.<br>

<p>I'll be calling the dragons of China;<br>

See the dancers of the Nile.<br>

See the wings of change are on display<br>

This revelation mine.<br>

<p>Feel the calling of a miracle<br>

In the presence of the word.<br>

Head in to the headlight.<br>

Don't turn from the rain.<br>

There's a fire raging somewhere near,<br>

Like a longtime friend who's<br>

Seen it darker than ebony.<br>

Take off on the turnpike<br>

(Asking for the first call)<br>

Give me more of the same<br>

(Asking for a song)<br>

There's a fire burning in my heart again.<br>

<p>Feel the calling of a miracle,<br>

The revelation mine.<br>

<font size=-1 arial><b>Rabin/Anderson</b></font><br>

<p>Am I waking to this magic<br>

Am I seeing, all is human,<br>

Human after all...<br>

<p>I wanna be inside your heart<br>

Are you ready<br>

I wanna love forever<br>

Are you thinking<br>

I wanna be inside your heart<br>

What I'm thinking<br>

I wanna know you're with me.<br>

<p>Highways, starways, many ways<br>

To be open tonight.<br>

High time, look inside your life.<br>

I am waiting.<br>

<p>I am waiting; are you ready?<br>

I am waiting; can you hear me?<br>

Can you hear me?<br>

<p>I happened in the water.<br>

The heaven will fall.<br>

The break in the water.<br>

The secret birth.<br>

<p>Said she loves me; I believe her.<br>

Waited lifetimes, say this to you.<br>

<p>I wanna be inside your heart<br>

Are you ready<br>

I wanna love forever<br>

Are you thinking<br>

I wanna be inside your heart<br>

What I'm thinking<br>

I wanna know you're with me.<br>

<p>Highways, starways, many ways<br>

To be open tonight.<br>

High time, look inside your life.<br>

I am waiting.<br>

Say you need me, I'm yours.<br>

Say you need me, just because.<br>

<p>(It's our freedom...)<br>

It's our freedom, hear me now.<br>

We are made to be here now.<br>

We'll be waiting for the word<br>

As the healing of the world.<br>

Make me promises, to be true,<br>

All my life my world is you.<br>

<p>I am waiting; are you ready?<br>

Are you ready?<br>

I am waiting; can you hear me?<br>

Can you hear me?<br>

<p>You can hear the siren screaming,<br>

Take me to the promised land;<br>

See the intervention<br>

Take you higher and higher.<br>

See we are the giving world,<br>

We are responsible,<br>

We're not about to break-<br>

<p>It's just a state of play<br>

It's just a state of play<br>

<p>This is the revolution,<br>

Coming with the giving world<br>

No need to wait for your<br>

Appointment is made.<br>

No need to ask for help,<br>

It's in the love we breathe<br>

Dancing in the new design<br>

<p>It's just a state of play<br>

It's just a state of play<br>

<p>Secret needing,<br>

From this love I'm feeding<br>

High time flying,<br>

From your love I'm feeding<br>

High time flying,<br>

Monumental reaching to god love<br>

Secret needing,<br>

All I really want to know right now...<br>

The state of play<br>

Are you looking at it<br>

Is it looking at you.<br>

<p>It's just a state of play<br>

It's just a state of play<br>

<p>No point in kidding,<br>

Let the children split the atom-<br>

A firm believer this<br>

Appointment with love.<br>

All those who look for glory,<br>

They see the flags are flying,<br>

They hear the siren screaming-<br>

<font size=-1 arial><b>Rabin/Hodgson/Anderson</b></font><br>

<p>Don't you know it's my way out<br>

To be on my own.<br>

When I feel like crying out<br>

I do it best alone.<br>

Can you give me love and<br>

Protection to shield my heart.<br>

All the fear I feel from doubt<br>

Is tearing me apart.<br>

<p>I wanna love, I wanna give,<br>

I want to find another way to live.<br>

Another shout, another cry,<br>

And the walls come tumbling down.<br>

<p>Don't you know there's no way out;<br>

Your pain's your own,<br>

And the more we scream and shout<br>

The more we feel alone.<br>

I can feel my anger rising-<br>

Am I to blame?<br>

And I'm not gonna keep it inside me.<br>

Do you feel the same?<br>

<p>I wanna love, I wanna give,<br>

I want to find another way to live.<br>

Another shout, another cry,<br>

And the walls come tumbling down.<br>

And I'm calling you.<br>

<p>Where will you be when you're not here.<br>

How many lives in this earth time.<br>

You are my soul and this you are.<br>

Two souls intertwined,<br>

That's what we are.<br>

<p>We can, we walk, hand in hand,<br>

All the life,<br>

Be the one, everything to me;<br>

You, I am dreaming.<br>

We have lived and known before,<br>

I feel it.<br>

<p>Where will you lie.<br>

<p>When will I know when you are gone.<br>

Where I be, and I will miss you.<br>

We are this love in this life,<br>

Two sould intertwined like once before.<br>

See this meeting, hand in hand,<br>

Every life,<br>

Be the one, everything to me;<br>

You are my feeling.<br>

<p>No need to fear this love of life,<br>

We are the truth of every earth life.<br>

No need to fear this life at all,<br>

We are the sun and everlasting life.<br>

Where will you be hearing this song.<br>

How many lives in this earth time.<br>

You are my soul and this you are.<br>

You are my soul and this you are.<br>

<p>Where will you lie<br>

<p>(Instrumental)

<p><font size="-1"><b>b. Talk</b>* <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabin/Anderson</font><br>

<p>Hold your head up high you know<br>

You've come a long way, a long way<br>

Tainted as a fugitive with nothing left to say<br>

Temptation may come, hope your vision doesn't stray<br>

In the name of god you may be forced away<br>

<p>Moving forward to the only place you 

know<br>

Side tracked by some indiscretion,<br>

Changing as you go<br>

Temptation may come, hope your<br>

Conscience doesn't hide<br>

The longest trip you'll take is inside<br>

<p>It's the last time,<br>

Telling myself everything<br>

Call me over, than bring me back again<br>

It's the last chance,<br>

Telling myself, that I believe<br>

Your forever, is mine, and all I need<br>

<p>Now! Life! Tell me now, in your arms<br>

All I really need, is you by my side<br>

I sing this to you, all the world and all it is<br>

I bring this to you, this gift of love<br>

<p>And the world turns...<br>

And the world turns...<br>

Time tells all we know...<br>

We look to tin jesus on the radio<br>

Pledge me what you got...<br>

I'll give you eternal resting spot<br>

How intense I pray depends on how much you pay.<br>

<p>It's the last time, getting it, this 

life<br>

First calling, in a silent spring<br>

It's the first time, getting it, this life<br>

First calling, in a silent spring<br>

Fear! Strikes!-Deeper than-visionary<br>

Screams and tears, never justify this love<br>

<p>Talk! Talk! listening<br>

Like the first words ever to reach out<br>

Talk! Talk!<br>

Like the first sounds, in a silent spring<br>

Talk! Talk! listening<br>

Like the first words ever to reach out to you<br>

Talk! Talk!<br>

Like the first sound, you start to sing<br>

<p>So take your time<br>

Look round and see<br>

The most in time,<br>

Is where you're meant to be<br>

For they talk too loud,<br>

And take the hope and peace<br>

From your heart<br>

We call this surrender<br>

Slowly towards the north,<br>

And this endless dream,<br>

Giving ourselves everything<br>

We're deserving,<br>

We're gonna bring it back again<br>

It's the last time,<br>

Telling myself everything<br>

It's the last time,<br>

Bring me back, bring me back again<br>

When the world brings you down<br>

You can search you inside<br>

For the love you will find<br>

(Bring me back home)<br>

When the world brings you down<br>

You can search you inside<br>

When the world brings you down<br>

I've waited so long<br>

When the world brings you down<br>

You gotta play this living game<br>

When the world brings you down

<p><font size="-1"><b>c. Endless Dream*</b><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabin/Anderson</font><br>

<p>So take your time<br>

Look round and see<br>

The most in time,<br>

Is where you're meant to be<br>

For you are light<br>

Inside your dreams<br>

For you will find,<br>

That it's something<br>

That touches me.</font>
