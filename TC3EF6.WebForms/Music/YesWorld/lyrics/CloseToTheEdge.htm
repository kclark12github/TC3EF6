Of Change</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

<font size=-1 arial><b>Anderson/Howe</b></font></font> 

<p> 

<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A seasoned witch could call 

you from the depths of your disgrace,<br>

And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace,<br>

And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar,<br>

Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour.<br>

And assessing points to nowhere, leading ev'ry single one.<br>

A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun,<br>

And take away the plain in which we move,<br>

And choose the course you're running. 

<p>Down at the edge, round by the corner,<br>

Not right away, not right away.<br>

Close to the edge, down by a river,<br>

Not right away, not right away. 

<p>Crossed the line around the changes of the summer,<br>

Reaching to call the color of the sky.<br>

Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see.<br>

Getting over all the time I had to worry,<br>

Leaving all the changes far from far behind.<br>

We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name. 

<p>Down at the end, round by the corner.<br>

Close to the edge, just by a river.<br>

Seasons will pass you by.<br>

I get up, I get down.<br>

Now that it's all over and done,<br>

Now that you find, now that you're whole. 

<p><b>II. Total Mass Retain</b><br>

<font size=-1 arial><b>Anderson/Squire</b></font> 

<p>My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love.<br>

It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above.<br>

I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand.<br>

There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand. 

<p>Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see,<br>

As armoured movers took approach to overlook the sea.<br>

There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be. 

<p>Down at the edge, close by a river.<br>

Close to the edge, round by the corner.<br>

Close to the end, down by the corner.<br>

Down at the edge, round by the river. 

<p>Sudden call shouldn't take away the startled memory.<br>

All in all, the journey takes you all the way.<br>

As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known.<br>

Guessing problems only to deceive the mention,<br>

Passing paths that climb halfway into the void.<br>

As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain. 

<p>Down at the edge, round by the corner.<br>

Close to the end, down by a river.<br>

Seasons will pass you by.<br>

I get up, I get down. 

<p><b>III. I Get Up, I Get Down</b><br>

<font size=-1 arial><b>Anderson/Howe</b></font> 

<p>In her white lace<br>

You can clearly see the lady sadly looking.<br>

Saying that she'd take the blame<br>

For the crucifixion of her own domain. 

<p>I get up, I get down,<br>

I get up, I get down.<br>

Two million people barely satisfy.<br>

Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late.<br>

The eyes of honesty can achieve.<br>

How many millions do we deceive each day? 

<p>[Thru the duty she would coil their said<br>

amusement of her story asking only interest<br>

could be laid upon the children of her domain]<br>

<br>

I get up, I get down.<br>

I get up, I get down. 

<p>In charge of who is there in charge of me.<br>

Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?<br>

The truth is written all along the page.<br>

How old will I be before I come of age for you?<br>

I get up, I get down.<br>

I get up, I get down.<br>

I get up, I get down. 

<p><b>IV. Seasons Of Man</b><br>

<font size=-1 arial><b>Anderson/Howe</b></font> 

<p>The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes.<br>

A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, so it seems.<br>

And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love.<br>

As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above.<br>

Ah, ah. 

<p>Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space,<br>

He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race.<br>

I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place.<br>

On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley,<br>

Called to witness cycles only of the past.<br>

And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark. 

<p>Close to the edge, down by the river.<br>

Down at the end, round by the corner.<br>

Seasons will pass you by,<br>

Now that it's all over and done,<br>

Called to the seed, right to the sun.<br>

Now that you find, now that you're whole.<br>

Seasons will pass you by,<br>

I get up, I get down.<br>

I get up, I get down.<br>

I get up, I get down.

You And I</font> 

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" ><b>I. Cord Of Life</b></font><br>

<font size=-1 arial><b>Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire</b></font> 

<p> A man conceived a moment's answers to the dream.<br>

Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes.<br>

As a foundation left to create the spiral aim,<br>

A movement regained and regarded both the same,<br>

All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.<br>

Changed only for a sight of sound, the space agreed.<br>

Between the picture of time behind the face of need,<br>

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,<br>

Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,<br>

All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you.<br>

Oh.<br>

<p>Coins and crosses<br>

<pre><i>   Turn round tailor, assaulting</i></pre>

<p>Never know their fruitless worth;<br>

<pre>

<i>all the mornings of the interest shown,



presenting one another to the cord,</i></pre>

Cords are broken,<br>

<i> 

<pre>   All left dying, rediscovered



Of the door that turned round,</pre>

</i>Locked inside the mother earth.<br>

<i> 

<pre>   To close the cover, all the



interest shown,</pre>

</i> They won't hide, hold, they won't tell you,<br>

<i> 

<pre>   To turn one another, to the



sign at the time float your climb.</pre>

</i> Watching the world, watching all of the world,<br>

Watching us go by. 

<p> 

<p>And you and I climb over the sea to the valley,<br>

And you and I reached out for reasons to call. 

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" ><b>II. Eclipse</b></font><br>

<font size=-1 arial><b>Anderson/Bruford/Squire</b></font> 

<p>Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,<br>

Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,<br>

As a movement regained and regarded both the same,<br>

All complete in the side of seeds of life with you. 

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" ><b>III. The Preacher 

the Teacher</b></font><br>

<font size=-1 arial><b>Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire</b></font> 

<p>Sad preacher nailed upon the coloured door of time;<br>

Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme.<br>

There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify;<br>

Political ends, as sad remains, will die.<br>

Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you.<br>

Ooh, ooh. 

<p>I listened hard but could not see<br>

Life tempo change out and inside me.<br>

The preacher trained in all to lose his name;<br>

The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same.<br>

In the end, we'll agree, we'll accept, we'll immortalize<br>

That the truth of the man maturing in his eyes,<br>

All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you. 

<p>Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid,<br>

As a moment regained and regarded both the same,<br>

Emotion revealed as the ocean maid,<br>

A clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you. 

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" ><b>IV. Apocalypse</b></font><br>

<font size=-1 arial><b>Anderson/Bruford/Howe/Squire</b></font> 

<p>And you and I climb, crossing the shapes of the morning.<br>

And you and I reach over the sun for the river.<br>

And you and I climb, clearer, towards the movement.<br>

And you and I called over valleys of endless seas.

Khatru</font><br>

<font size=-1 arial><b>Anderson/Howe/Wakeman</b></font> 

<p>Sing, bird of prey;<br>

Beauty begins at the foot of you. Do you believe the manner?<br>

Gold stainless nail,<br>

Torn through the distance of man<br>

As they regard the summit. 

<p>Even Siberia goes through the motions.<br>

Hold out and hold up;<br>

Hold down the window.

<pre>   Outbound, river,</pre>

</i> Hold out the morning that comes into view. <i> 

<pre>   Bluetail, tailfly.</pre>

</i> River running right on over my head. 

<p> 

<p>How does she sing?<br>

Who holds the ring? And ring and you will find me coming.<br>

Cold reigning king,<br>

Hold all the secrets from you<br>

As they produce the movement. 

<p>Even Siberia goes through the motions.<br>

Hold out and hold up;<br>

Hold down the window. 

<i> 

<pre>   Outbound, river,</pre>

</i> Hold out the morning that comes into view. <i>

Dood'ndoodit, dah, d't-d't-dah.

<p>Hold down the window;<br>

Hold out the morning that comes into view.<br>

Warm side, the tower;<br>

Green leaves reveal the heart spoken Khatru. 

<p>Gold stainless nail,<br>

Cold reigning king,<br>

Shelter the women that sing<br>

As they produce the movement.<br>

Soul mark, mover,<br>

Called out, saviour,<br>

Moon gate, climber,<br>

Turn round, glider.
