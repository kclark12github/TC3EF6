<p><b>The One</b>

<br><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial" size=-1 ><b>Anderson/Squire</b></font>

<p>Never underestimate the loving<br>

How we intertwine our very soul<br>

How we fill each other's spaces to lose control<br>

When you're talking, be the children<br>

Who stand on solid ground<br>

Never underestimate the giving that will bring you around

<p>I'll be there, to bring you this love 

in the morning<br>

I'll be there, to bring you the stars at night<br>

I'll be there, just waiting to hear you singing

<p>Never underestimate a giver<br>

The gift of love will surely be<br>

When you're asking for the secrets to set you free<br>

When you're talking to the friendship<br>

That love of higher self<br>

This gift of love is the answer to all your doubts

<p>Be the one, giving in to love<br>

Never let the good in life desert you<br>

Be the one, giving in to love<br>

Never let the fools destroy your dreams<br>

Be the one, giving in to love<br>

I can dream myself every minute<br>

So how did we become, masters of limitation?

<p>I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there<br>

To make it right for you

<p>Giving in, giving in to love<br>

It's the balance of this everyday feeling<br>

Giving in, giving in to love<br>

Without love our dreams become illusion<br>

Giving in, giving in to love<br>

I can hear you singing every minute<br>

So you can sing the song, and see the truth

<p><b>Humankind</b><br>

<font size=-1 arial><b>Anderson/Squire</b></font>

<p>So we worked all around amidst the glory of life<br>

Any fire of the flame would be made<br>

Should the famine of change to diguise everyone<br>

Who cannot see the soul of truth ready made

<p>But all because we're changing now<br>

As the prophets of doom speak their mind<br>

It's a long, long way from where the system began<br>

It's a long, long way humankind

<p>So we dance down on nature as we try to repeat<br>

All our efforts as one sent today<br>

Taking back instead of giving, taking back more or less<br>

Taking back a sense of being afraid<br>

So all this necessary changes now, as the will to help all man<br>

And the children of the crucified will better off, better dead

<p>But all this senseless killing, and all 

these chains and lies<br>

I want to know right now, I want to know right now<br>

I want to know where we come from<br>

For it's a long, long way from where the system began<br>

It's a long, long way humankind<br>

it's a long, long way from where the system began<br>

it's a long, long way humankind, yeah<br>

<p>

Giving in, giving in to love<br>

I can see and feel the truth every minute<br>

Giving in, giving in to love<br>

Be the one to rescue you, rescue you<br>

Giving in, giving in to the right love<br>

There's no way that you can live without it<br>

So we can become masters of our invention<br>

<p>Don't stand still

<p>Never underestimate the power<br>

Never underestimate the power

<p>(Instrumental)

<p><b>Crossfire</b><br>

<font size=-1><b>Anderson/Squire</b></font>

<p>Julie's sick and tired of her job n' all the reasons lately<br>

She took it out on God and laid her soul to hell and let the baby die<br>

Julie's child was born without a need or a reason for being<br>

She took it as a message from a real and a distant life<br>

<p>Shirley gets to help her with the child 

though she's strung out on crack time<br>

Shirley never knew what it was to be held in real love<br>

Together getting high to get to mess up their night<br>

Anything to get up so they're losing their mind<br>

Just to get high, breaking out from this life, gotta get them a drug to get higher<br>

<p>Julie gets to walking out and drags the child, says "come on"<br>

How we'll walk in the dark of the morning<br>

Cars screaming round the corner, drugged to heaven, guns are loaded, locked in vengeance<br>

<p>Who shoots the child?

<p>Watching in the ghetto is the spine and the cruel of the gang life<br>

Sign language of the get go you get in the gang life<br>

Fear the only law, fear is all we hear about,<br>

Feed us in the raw, fear is all we fear about<br>

Listen, get up, quickly get up, get up<br>

It's the answer to punishment given you<br>

<p>Don't give us reasons,<br>

Caught in the crossfire dying<br>

God give us reasons,<br>

Don't give a reason, God give a reason<br>

Why lay dead a child's life?<br>

<p><b>The Giving Things</b><br>

<font size=-1><b>Anderson/Howe</b></font>

<p>That talk is just a worry and a worry in a man<br>

That life is just a worrying and getting in a mess<br>

That deal is just awakening his spirit to be giving him<br>

The pleasure of the giving things within<br>

This day is of a meeting of the manner to be borne<br>

And like a ship you come safely to the shore of love eternal<br>

<p><b>That Is</b><br>

<font size=-1><b>Anderson</b></font><br>

<p>That talk is just a worry and a worry in a man<br>

That life is just a worrying and getting in a mess<br>

That deal is just awakening his spirit to be giving him<br>

The pleasure of the giving things within<br>

<p>That word is in it, that talk is in it<br>

This day is of a meeting of the manner to be borne<br>

And like a ship you come safely to the shore of love eternal<br>

<p>That beat is of the wanting of the where you're going<br>

That street talk is the basis of the push and shove<br>

They never told you that you have the right<br>

The spirit of the angel, angels sing "Shaava, shava shava-Shaava"<br>

<p>They be waiting for you, they be asking for you<br>

We depending on you, we depending on your healing of the structure centre<br>

Until you reach and touch your own redemption<br>

<p>They never give you a reason, they never give you a reason<br>

They never give you a, give you a, give you a, give you a reason<br>

<p><b>All In All</b><br>

<font size=-1><b>Anderson/White</b></font>

<p>All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free<br>

Watching for the signals that some easily<br>

Take it as a point of love, a reference place to where you are<br>

Every step a step to set you free<br>

<p>All for the sake and the calling of light<br>

Ask as you give, as you measure in time<br>

<p>All in all this will to give, this sacrament, this need to live<br>

Take it a step to bring love easily<br>

All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free<br>

Waiting for the waiting to be free<br>

<p>Talk is the easy send, everyone heard<br>

Ask as you seek the clear, ask and you can<br>

<p>This play is of a myriad of conscience sitting<br>

This day is of a special way of love relating<br>

This sight is in it, this way is in it, the dream is of the positive to make you<br>

Wonder<br>

How did heaven begin?<br>

This time is in it, this thought is in it, this light is in it,<br>

When you see, you get it<br>

<p>All in all the wisdom call, you shall  be young, you shall be free<br>

Take it as it comes so easily<br>

<p>We'll be there beside the sign, this wherewithal, this will to be,<br>

Bringing all the love that's meant to be<br>

All in all we shall be young, we shall be free, we shall be there<br>

All in all this time is meant to be<br>

<p><b>How Did Heaven Begin</b><br>

<font size=-1><b>Anderson/Howe/White</b></font><br>

<p>These days are just a worry to the children of the world<br>

These days are just a worry to the children of the world<br>

How did heaven begin?<br>

How did heaven begin?<br>

<p><b>Agree To Agree</b><br>

<font size=-1 arial><b>Anderson/Squire</b></font>

<p>Don't imagine any way, so any fool can take away the drugs and the pressure<br>

Asking for the level where a world divides its answers<br>

To the gang lords of evil life, (they) can't show you how<br>

Look upon this life as just a picture you are painting<br>

There is a reason for this being<br>

Look upon this place as just a part of all that is<br>

It is a spiritual part of being<br>

<p>Live within the power, you can be the strength it is<br>

Walk among the living, you can be the strength it is<br>

To give, to live, this hope, comes through,<br>

It takes the trust to agree this agreement<br>

Live for the breaking free<br>

Live for the breaking freedom<br>

Just let it come through come through</font>
