    When there are few,<br>
    People making me feel good.<br>
    Why is there me,<br>
    When air is free,<br>
    Some I can see better than I should,<br>
    There's only us,<br>
    Simply because,<br>
    Thinking of us makes us both happy<br>
    I think of you everyway, yesterday and today,<br>
    I think of things we do all the way everyday<br>
    Stand in the sea<br>
    Sing songs for me,<br>
    Sing happily making me feel good,<br>
    Watching your eyes,<br>
    Feeling your sighs,<br>
    Saying goodbyes better than I could,<br>
    There's only us,<br>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Looking around me<br>
    There's not too much in life I miss<br>
    Things that I can't see<br>
    I'll touch and I'll feel then I'll kiss<br>
    Then I saw you standing there<br>
    With a smile I couldn't share<br>
    Just looking around, everywhere.<br>
    Tunes that I can't hear,<br>
    Would take me for a while my smile<br>
    Fares that are too dear<br>
    I'd rather walk out another smile<br>
    Then I heard a tune so right<br>
    It was in the light of night<br>
    Just listening around everywhere<br>
    All the things I've wanted to do<br>
    Take so much time to get around to you<br>
    Just reach out and catch and hold on<br>
    Leaving trails of dust and lust never even lying or trying<br>
    Keep on moving and never dying.<br>
    Smiles that I don't see<br>
    I'll make them up as I go on<br>
    Laughs that just can't be<br>
    I'll make and laugh at everyone<br>
    Then I saw you in your place<br>
    With a laugh upon your face<br>
    Just looking around everywhere<br>
    Looking around with my feet on the ground full of words and<br>
    Of sound bringing smiles all around<br>
    Satisfy me with your words that can be full of sound and I'll<br>
    See I'm just looking around.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aaaaahhh</font><br>
    <font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Harold Land with a wave of his hand,<br>
    Said goodbye to all that,<br>
    He paid his bills, stopped the Milk, then put on his hat,<br>
    He tried to say his last farewells as quickly as he could,<br>
    Promising that he would return, but doubted that he would,<br>
    Doubted that he would.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Now he's marching soldiers in the rain<br>
    As on to war they rode.<br>
    A long thin line of human mind,<br>
    Damnation as their load!<br>
    In the mud in coldness dark he'd shiver out his fear,<br>
    What disappointing sights he'd seen instead of one's so dear<br>
    instead of one's so dear</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Going home, He's going home to the land 
    he loved so well,<br>
    Going home, he fought for two whole years he never fell,<br>
    He's going home, He's going home.<br>
    Harold Land with a wave of his hand stood sadly on the stage,<br>
    Clutching red ribbons from a badge but he didn't look his age,<br>
    Only two years had passed between his leaving home and back,<br>
    He had lost his love and youth while leading the attack<br>
    Leading the attack</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">In conversation it could be said,<br>
    Well after war your heart is dead,<br>
    Well it's not hard to understand,<br>
    There is no heart in Harold Land.</font></p>

    I was lonely without her<br>
    Can't stop thinking about her now<br>
    Every little thing she does<br>
    She does for me yeah<br>
    And you know the things she does<br>
    She does for me<br>
    When I'm with her I'm happy<br>
    Just to know that she loves me<br>

  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">She brings the sunshine to a rainy afternoon<br>
    She puts the sweetness in and stirs it with a spoon,<br>
    She watches for my moods and never brings me down<br>
    She puts the sweetness in all around<br>
    She knows just what to say to make me feel so good inside<br>
    And when I'm all alone I feel I don't want to hide<br>
    Today she bought me in and told me where she'd been<br>
    She put my mind at rest and put the sweetness in<br>
    I'll ask her for some time to go and look around<br>
    She puts the sweetness in all around<br>
    She knows just what to say to make a sunny day<br>
    And when I'm all alone I really don't feel that way.<br>
    Tell me how would you feel with no world of your own<br>
    And nobody to hold, I just can't see the way<br>
    I'm so glad it's today and you're here, you're here.<br>

  <font size=-1 arial><b>Anderson</b></font></font> 
  <p></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Sunshine is creeping in and somewhere 
    in a field a life begins,<br>
    An egg too proud to rape the beginning of the shape of things to come,<br>
    That start the run, life has begun, fly fast the gun.<br>
    The Mother flew too late and life within the egg was left to fate,<br>
    Not really knowing how the world outside would take it when it came,<br>
    And life's the same for things we aim, are we to blame?<br>
    Don't doubt the fact there's life within you,<br>
    Yesterday's endings will tomorrow life give you,<br>
    All that dies, dies for a reason,<br>
    To put its strength into the Season,<br>
    Survival, Survival,<br>
    They take away and they give their life as they live,<br>
    The living right to live, it's all that we need to show<br>
    The livings right to know.<br>
    The egg breaks all is out, the crawling bird begins to scream and shout,<br>
    Where is the parent bird, a loneliness arose and heard its name-<br>
    Ring in for live's begin, survival win, survival's sin.<br>
    So soon the evening comes with it runs the aching<br>
    Fear of hate could Someone still remain who thinks he<br>
    Still could gain by escaping fate? it's much too late,<br>
    Don't underrate, appreciate.<br>
    And we're all going<br>
    And we're all going<br>
    And we're all going somewhere!</font></p>
