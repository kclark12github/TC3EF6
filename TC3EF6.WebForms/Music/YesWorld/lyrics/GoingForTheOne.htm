<font size=-1 arial><b>Anderson</b></font></font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Get the idea cross around the track<br>

Underneath the flank of a thoroughbred racing chaser<br>

Getting the feel as a river flows<br>

Would you like to go n' shoot the mountain masses<br>

And here you stand no taller than the grass sees<br>

And should you really chase so hard<br>

The truth of sport plays rings around you</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Going for the one<br>

Going for the one</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Get in the way as the tons of water<br>

Racing with you crashing thru the rudder<br>

Once at the start can you gamble<br>

That you really surely really mean to finish<br>

After seeing all your sense of fear diminish<br>

As you treat danger a pure collection<br>

As you throw away misconceptions<br>

Going for the one<br>

Going for the one<br>

Going for a listen in time<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken so high<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to touch to move<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;listen to life<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;touching touch time<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;travel twilight<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken so high<br>

Roundabout, sounding out, love you so<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love you so<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love you so</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Now the verses I've sang<br>

Don't add much weight to the story in my head<br>

So I'm thinking I should go and write a punch line<br>

But they're so hard to find<br>

In my cosmic mind<br>

So I think I'll take a look out of the window<br>

When I think about you<br>

I don't feel low<br>

N'should I really chase so hard<br>

The truth of sport plays rings around you<br>

Going for the one<br>

Going for the one<br>

Going for to listen in time<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken so high<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to touch to move<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;listen to life<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching touch time<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;travel twilight<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken so high<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taking your time<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turn on to love<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turnstile to one<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tender timing<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rocking rolling<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;listen in time<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken so high<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to touch to move<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;listen to life<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;touching touchtime<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;travel twilight<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken so high<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taking your time<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turn on to love<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turnstile to one<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tender timing<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rocking rolling<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turn on to love<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turnstile to one<br>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Realising a form out of stone<br>

Set hands moving<br>

Roan shaped his heart<br>

Thru his working hands<br>

Work to mould his passion into clay<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the sun</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">In his room, his lady<br>

She would dance and sing so completely<br>

So be still, he now cries<br>

I have time, oh let clay transform thee so</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">In the deep cold of night<br>

Winter calls, he cries, don't deny me<br>

For his lady, deep her illness<br>

Time has caught her<br>

And will for all reasons take her</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">In the still light of dawn, she dies<br>

Helpless hands soul revealing</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Like leaves we touch, we learn<br>

We once knew the story<br>

As Winter calls he will starve<br>

All but to see the stone be life</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Now Roan no more tears<br>

Set to work his strength<br>

So transformed him<br>

Realising a form out of stone, his work<br>

So absorbed him<br>

Could she hear him<br>

Could she see him<br>

All aglow was his room dazed in this light<br>

He would touch her<br>

He would hold her<br>

Laughing as they danced<br>

Highest colours touching others</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Did her eyes at the turn of the century<br>

Tell me plainly<br>

When we meet, how we'll love, oh let life so transform me</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Like leaves we touched, we danced<br>

We once knew the story<br>

As autumn called and we both<br>

Remembered all those many years ago<br>

I'm sure we know</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Was the sign with a touch<br>

As I kiss your fingers<br>

We walk hands in the sun<br>

Memories when we're young<br>

Love lingers so.</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Was it sun thru the haze<br>

That made all your looks<br>

As warm as moonlight<br>

As a pearl deep your eyes<br>

Tears have flown away<br>

All the same light</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Did her eyes at the turn of the century<br>

Tell me plainly<br>

When we meet how we'll look<br>

As we smile time will leave me clearly</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Like leaves we touch, we see<br>

We will know the story<br>

As Autumn calls we'll both remember<br>

All those many years ago</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">When you've tried most everything and 

nothing's taking you higher<br>

When you've come to realise, you've been playing with fire<br>

Hear me when I say to you, it's really down to your heart</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">It's the beginning of a new love in sight<br>

You've got the way to make it all happen<br>

Set it spinning turning roundabout<br>

Create a new dimension<br>

When we are winning we can stop and shout<br>

Making love towards perfection</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">I've been all around the world and seen 

so many faces<br>

Young and old a story told, filling in my spaces<br>

Now without a trace of doubt, I feel it every hour</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">It's the beginning of a new love inside<br>

Could be an ever opening flower<br>

No hesitation when we're all about<br>

To build a shining tower<br>

No explanations, need to work it out<br>

You know we've got the power</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Parallel our sights<br>

And we will find, that we, we need, to be, where we, belong<br>

Parallel our heights<br>

Display our rights and wrongs, and always, keep it STRONG</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">I awoke this morning<br>

Love laid me down by the river<br>

Drifting I turned on up stream<br>

Bound for my forgiver<br>

In the giving of my eyes to see your face<br>

Sound did silence me<br>

Leaving no trace<br>

I beg to leave, to hear your wonderous stories<br>

Beg to hear your wonderous stories 'LA AHA'</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">He spoke of lands not far<br>

Nor lands they were in his mind<br>

Of fusion captured high<br>

Where reason captured his time<br>

In no time at all he took me to the gate<br>

In haste I quickly<br>

Checked the time<br>

If I was late<br>

I had to leave, to hear your wonderous stories<br>

Had to hear your wonderous stories 'LA AHA, LA AHA'</font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Geneva, Arial">Hearing<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing hearing your wonderous stories<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing your wonderous stories<br>

It is no lie I see deeply into the future<br>

Imagine everything<br>

You're close<br>

And were you there<br>

To stand so cautiously at first<br>

And then so high<br>

As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky<br>

I bid it to return<br>

To hear your wonderous stories<br>

Return to hear your wonderous stories<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to hear your wonderous stories<br>
