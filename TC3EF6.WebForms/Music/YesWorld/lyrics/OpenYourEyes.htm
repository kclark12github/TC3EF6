  <br>
  Deep inside....the solution, staring you down<br>
  Looking for ...the solution, bringing you round<br>
  Round and round we go, round and round we go<br>
  <br>
  The past can haunt your future so<br>
  Shadows are falling, look out below<br>
  Voices are calling echoes unknown<br>
  There must be more to this life than we all know.....<br>
  <br>
  Looking for....the solution,staring you down<br>
  Deep inside ...the solution, bringing you round<br>
  <br>
  Giving in, giving out, do the best you can do<br>
  Giving in, giving out, it's all up to you<br>
  Giving in, giving out, do the best you can do<br>
  Giving in, giving out, it's all up to you<br>
  <br>
  Over and under and down we go<br>
  Down we go<br>
  Caught at the crossroads, &quot;Which way to go?&quot;<br>
  Path unknown<br>
  Choosing the right path? Only you know......<br>
  <br>
  Looking for....The solution, you hold the key<br>
  Deep inside....The solution, set yourself free<br>
  Round and round we go, round and round we go<br>
  <br>
  Giving in, giving out, do the best you can do<br>
  Giving in, giving out, its all up to you<br>
  It's all up to you<br>
  <br>
  It's all up to you</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
