<p>Nothing can take us far enough<br>

Emotion... far enough together<br>

As the light shines so bright<br>

Bright enough to let us in<br>

<p>Nothing can bridge our souls'<br>

Devotion... fast enough together<br>

As the power proves you right<br>

Right enough to let you begin<br>

<p>So many displaced among the future dreamers <br>

Realised their doubles<br>

Took a new step<br>

A question of origin <br>

<p>Only in the recent past<br>

Seeking for to realise<br>

Skyward shone <br>

Like beacons <br>

A question of origin<br>

<p> Ten thousand millions free<br>

To the westward light<br>

The dreamers represent<br>

This arc of peace <br>

<p>As the poets entranced<br>

The anchor redeemed<br>

Secrets of science<br>

The history of the future<br>

Was surely made<br>

<p> Just what keeps us so alive<br>

Just what makes us realise<br>

Our home<br>

Is our world, our life<br>

Home is our world<br>

<p> Nothing can take us far enough<br>

Emotion... far enough together<br>

As the light shines so bright<br>

Bright enough to let us in<br>

<p>Nothing can bridge our souls<br>

Devotion... fast enough together<br>

As the power proves you right<br>

Right enough to let you begin<br>

<p>Speak so fast to the prophets<br>

Of the living<br>

Looking for the signs<br>

Spanning out the centuries<br>

Search for truth<br>

<p>Ancient ones... they watch<br>

And listen<br>

Carry our wishes...<br>

Took upon themselves to guide us<br>

Through the endless skies<br>

<p>Just what keeps us so alive<br>

Just what makes us realise<br>

Our home<br>

Is our world, our life<br>

Our hope is our world, our life<br>

<p>I have seen the passion<br>

That's in the hope that everyone<br>

Will find their way into<br>

The secret of<br>

The home of your heart<br>

<p>Living within the vision<br>

Within the power, beyond belief<br>

We see that hate destroys the soul<br>

Of anyone who tries to teach i<br>

<p>I have seen the dream<br>

That's in your heart<br>

That's in your eyes<br>

To bring you closer to the one <br>

<p>It's what keeps us so alive<br>

It's what makes us realise<br>

Our home is our world, our life<br>

Just what keeps us so alive<br>

Just what makes us realise<br>

Our home<br>

Is our world, our life<br>

Home is our world, our life<br>

<p>Send, ascending to the secrets<br>

All is pure and clear to resolve<br>

Nothing can change us now<br>

Send, ascending to the future<br>

Nothing can ever change us now <br>

We follow the sun <br>

We follow the sun<br>

We follow the sun<br>

<p>Truth is a simple place<br>

Here for us all to see<br>

Reach as it comes to you <br>

As it comes to me<br>

As I will always need you inside my heart<br>

<p>Peace is a word we teach<br>

A place for us all to reach<br>

Sing as it sings to you<br>

As it sings to me<br>

As I will always need you inside my heart<br>

<p>Golden forest golden lake<br>

Sanctuary, state of grace<br>

I will find reason a place to begin<br>

It will be a good day <br>

<p>Beginning is one place I've been before<br>

Watching the sunrise on the silver shores<br>

Setting me free again leading the way<br>

It will be a good day <br>

<p>Sometimes I forget<br>

How mighty this earth<br>

Astounding winter skies<br>

Truth is in birth<br>

Peace that it brings to me, my naked eyes<br>

Be a good day <br>

<p>Make me believe again<br>

Making me free again<br>

Making me see again <br>

<p>Golden mountains golden seas<br>

A thousand reasons singing to me <br>

Alive to this message <br>

Realising it all <br>

Be a good day <br>

<p>Learning to listen learning to see<br>

Learning is power making me free<br>

Free to believe again in my human side<br>

Giving me good reason <br>

Giving me good reason <br>

<p>(Come tomorrow)<br>

Make me believe again<br>

(Destiny)<br>

(Take the river)<br>

Making me free again <br>

(To the sea) <br>

<p>(Come tomorrow)<br>

Making me see again <br>

(Will be free) <br>

<p>Like a river <br>

<p>Time feels so much closer now<br>

You are with me, so real <br>

<p>We make our own heaven<br>

Clear through the sky<br>

The making of reason for you and I<br>

I sing of each season<br>

Making us feel<br>

This will be a good day<br>

This will be a good day <br>

<p>(Come tomorrow)<br>

Make me believe again<br>

(Destiny) <br>

<p>(Take the river)<br>

Making me free again<br>

(To the sea)<br>

(Come tomorrow)<br>

Making me see again <br>

Like a river to the sea <br>

<p>Make me believe again<br>

Making me free again<br>

(Come tomorrow)<br>

Making me see again <br>

(Destiny) <br>

<p>(Take the river)<br>

Making me free again <br>

(To the sea) <br>

<p>What you gonna do when the lightning strikes and hits you<br>

Who ya gonna call for the secret of stealing the world<br>

Swimming in this ocean of words on your new cellphone<br>

Diving for the wisdom of pearls in your eyes<br>

Come on <br>

<p>What ya gonna do when the lightning strikes and hits you<br>

How ya gonna laugh when the joker forgets his lines <br>

Stepping off a cloud into space whatever greets you<br>

Show me how you got this award for being alive <br>

<p>Waking up is waking to the power<br>

Dancing up is dancing till the dawn<br>

Talk talk talk will always get you someplace<br>

Shake it up 'n' shake me till I'm done<br>

Shake it up now! <br>

<p>She ay... Do wa bap<br>

She ay... Do wa bap<br>

She ay... Do wa bap<br>

<p>Who ya gonna call when the power<br>

Begins to chase you<br>

Spinning out of shape now you're learning to live again<br>

Fastening your seatbelt tonight it could get jumpy <br>

<p>Showing me the good 'n' that <br>

Life is not in vain<br>

&nbsp;<br>

Take take take 'n' take me thru the lightning<br>

Walk don't talk me always on the run <br>

Ride it out until you get the picture<br>

Shake it up and let me get me some<br>

Touching my spirit touching my feeling<br>

Moving till the moon is on the run<br>

<p>Here we are trying to mend all the broken hearts<br>

In a world where the pain is the fear<br>

Ain't no doubt there's a method to madness here<br>

Set your clock to the start of a brand new year <br>

<p>Shine your heart to the universe and get the news<br>

Not alone never have been, never will be<br>

See the truth, not to mention the promise made<br>

See them all, see them all high on judar rhythm <br>

<p>We began at the very first spring<br>

How the promise will come when the promise is made<br>

We will sing at the very first spring<br>

That the promise will come when the promise is made<br>

Promise is made, promise is made <br>

<p>Shake me up, take me up<br>

Face to face <br>

<p>Lift me up, shake me up<br>

Face to face <br>

<p>Make me real, make me longing to see you smile<br>

Shall we dancing, shall we be the dancing down under <br>

In this life of lives, are we ready to take the chance <br>

Moving to the rhythm, here at last to <br>

<p>Believe<br>

To believe <br>

<p>We began at the first real spring<br>

How the promise will come when the promise is made<br>

We will sing at the very first spring<br>

That the promise will come when the promise is made <br>

<p>We began at the first real spring - ya<br>

We will sing at the very first spring - ya <br>

<p>We began at the first real spring<br>

How the promise will come when the promise is made<br>

Cannot live without your truth <br>

<p>Not a lot is missing<br>

Every ounce of treasure found <br>

And I believe that everyone should get what<br>

They're allowed<br>

Suspected of belief that comes suspended<br>

In a sound <br>

And everybody wants some <br>

<p>It's the sound they make in heaven <br>

It's a sound for here on earth<br>

I've heard it in the whispering<br>

Of the wonders that we search<br>

We've waited far too long <br>

To hear the healing of the stars<br>

'N' everybody wants some <br>

<p>Everybody wants some<br>

Everybody wants some<br>

Everybody wants some<br>

Everybody wants some<br>

To feel alive <br>

Oh - does it get much better, much better<br>

Oh - does it get much better than this, than this <br>

<p>There's the sound that keeps you trying<br>

There's the sound that makes you smile<br>

There's a sound in every corner <br>

Of the world that we survive <br>

<p>Your temple is the harmony<br>

You feel the sacred ground <br>

Just wishing for the secret<br>

To appear within the sound<br>

Watching for the morning star <br>

The rhythm of the sun<br>

I hear it in my waking dreams<br>

The singing has begun <br>

<p>The passion that we walk upon<br>

The passion that we bring<br>

Is written for the mountains<br>

They love to hear us sing <br>

<p>Everybody wants some<br>

Everybody wants some <br>

Everybody wants some <br>

Everybody wants some <br>

To feel alive <br>

<p>Oh - doesn't get much better than this<br>

Oh - doesn't get much better than this, than this <br>

<p>Who made me make believe<br>

I'm alive I'm living<br>

Never underestimate<br>

The signals coming to you<br>

<p>Finally... We put it to the test<br>

Dedicate to the true believer in you <br>

Finally... Put it to the test<br>

Finally <br>

<p>Make no mistake to the mainstream<br>

Music be the master planner<br>

Just like the books you read<br>

You'll hear it on your radio scanner <br>

<p>It's not so much what you know <br>

Or who you know that's coming<br>

Its what you do regardless<br>

Its what you do... eventually <br>

<p>Finally... We put it to the test<br>

Dedicate to the true believer in you <br>

Finally... Put it to the test<br>

Finally <br>

<p>I've seen them running, down and out<br>

Never mind the good intentions <br>

A dreamer with a reason to live<br>

Is as clear as his next invention <br>

<p>You take a second look to find<br>

A second chance at giving<br>

The voices say do not despair<br>

There's a real good reason you're living <br>

<p>I could feel the earth moving<br>

I could see sky falling<br>

We can chase the storm<br>

We can sing the rain<br>

Walk the final distance<br>

Live this life again <br>

<p>Finally... We put it to the test<br>

Dedicate to the true believer in you<br>

Finally... Put it to the test telling me to let go <br>

<p>I can feel the earth moving (I can sing the rain)<br>

I can feel the rain coming (live this life again)<br>

I can feel the storm <br>

I can sing the rain<br>

I can free my heart<br>

Live this life again<br>

You can choose to stand<br>

You can choose to fall<br>

You can see the rain<br>

You can have it all <br>

<p>I can feel the rain coming<br>

I can feel the earth moving<br>

I can feel the love coming <br>

<p>Judging by the voice<br>

He was free to himself so real<br>

We slaved ourselves to sacrifice<br>

More than that we do not know<br>

Then you hear him on the radio<br>

He would play the sacred themes<br>

That my children sang to me <br>

<p>Amazing as it seems <br>

It was the answer to my dream<br>

His heart that touches me<br>

More than that I do not not know<br>

Then I hear him on the radio<br>

Remembering his every word <br>

<p>That my children sing to me<br>

We have seen the world, this ecstasy<br>

Now my children sing to me<br>

This loving place, beyond belief <br>

<p>You got to stand stand to to together<br>

Keep the message alive <br>

<p>You got to stand stand to to together<br>

To keep the message alive <br>

<p>Spirit up moving, spirit up<br>

Rhythm of sunfire <br>

<p>You got to stand stand to to together<br>

Keep the message alive <br>

<p>Listening for his words<br>

He would speak in ancient verse<br>

So we mesmerize a way to go<br>

Reaching out the universe<br>

Reaching out the universal<br>

Not afraid to learn new words <br>

<p>That our children sing to us<br>

We have seen the world, this ecstasy<br>

So his children bring to us<br>

<p>I speak from some sort of protection of learning<br>

Even though I make it up as I go on<br>

A special trait is that I've tried <br>

To reach all feelings <br>

So I speak a new language of love <br>

<p>Some say that it is written in the circle <br>

Others that it is written in the sun<br>

But I protect myself by seeing this experience<br>

As a metaphor for moving on <br>

<p>Sometimes I check myself<br>

To start to believe in <br>

The horoscopes you read everyday<br>

They're telling me somethings <br>

I really ought to know<br>

But then again I like to <br>

Then again I learn to<br>

Then again I'm running away <br>

<p>Vision is coming so fast I can't stop myself<br>

Vision forgets who is real<br>

On the city streets, people get lost<br>

Just waiting for history<br>

Pushing the real world away <br>

<p>Taking a chance only once in your life<br>

Only weakness can stop you from hearing <br>

New languages<br>

Translate each word<br>

As they bring you creation <br>

Your voice is the perfect key <br>

<p>Is there something that <br>

I'm supposed to see <br>

<p>Is there something that I'm <br>

Supposed to feel <br>

I'm with you<br>

And I can't help but want to know <br>

<p>(Talk to me) <br>

Is there something that I'm supposed to teach <br>

(Speak to me)<br>

Is there something that I'm supposed to find <br>

As I reach to the healing in each spoken word <br>

<p>For some strange reason time just cannot wait a minute <br>

I'm chasing every second before I let go<br>

Yesterday my history<br>

Dreams are still a mystery<br>

This living is a gift I should know <br>

<p>Lay it down and let me live the new language<br>

Let me learn at every twist every turn<br>

Lay it down and let me love the further future<br>

Let me know I'm running <br>

Let me know I'm learning<br>

Let me know I'm moving on <br>

<p>Vision is racing so fast I can't stop myself<br>

Chasing the reason <br>

For all kinds of wondering<br>

People embracing these feelings of limbo<br>

Just waiting for some kind of truth <br>

<p>Taking a chance as it comes only once<br>

Only strength can do justice<br>

With words of new languages <br>

Translate creation<br>

To bring you salvation<br>

Your voice is the perfect key <br>
