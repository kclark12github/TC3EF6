Welcome to the New Republic Pilot Trainning Center At Obroa-Skai.  If you 
want to skip registration and try a few missions, click <a 
href="missions.htm">here</a>.  Otherwise, please continue.<P>

Here, we will test your skills as a pilot and match you with the 
Republic fighter which is best suited to your skills.  If enough pilots 
join, we could begin to form squadrons.<P>

	 
To enter the Academy, <a href=mailto:dchen@binx.mbhs.edu>send</a>
your best pilot (plt) file or use your own e-mail capabilities and send it to 
dchen@binx.mbhs.edu/, OR, use the attachment function under Netscape.  
Include 
your name and e-mail address, so that we can mail back.  Also, please
change the subject to Pilot File for easier sorting.  Good luck, and 
may the Force(TM) be with you.
