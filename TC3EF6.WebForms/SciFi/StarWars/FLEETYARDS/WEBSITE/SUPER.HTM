<p>Solid black and 8 kilometers long, the Super-class of star destroyers
were the largest, most powerful ships that were ever completed and used in
the Galactic Civil War. Even to this day, it cannot be matched by any New
Republic ship.  Being more than five times the power of a Imperial Star
Destroyer, these ships lay waste to entire task forces at a time.  Their
only weakness are its relatively exposed shield towers, like like on the
Imperial I class star destroyers. Darth Vader's personal flagship, the
Executor, was the first Super star destroyer to be built.  It is estimated
that 11 of the beheamoths were built in the course of the empire, but by
five years after the Battle of Endor, none were left.

<p>  Unknown to most, a new class of Super star destroyers, the Eclipse,
was being constructed at around the time the reborn Emperor took control.
A fully 16 kilometers long, this vessel sported a co-axial superlaser
(yes, think Death Star here) and could fit a Victory Star Destroyer in its
fighter bay.  It also had 10 gravity well projectors, acting as a massive
gravitational object to any ship in hyperspace (sort of like a super-
Interdictor. Fortunately, this ship was never completed.
