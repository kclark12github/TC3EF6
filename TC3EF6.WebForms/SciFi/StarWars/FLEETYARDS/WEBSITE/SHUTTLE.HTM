<P>
The Lamada Class Shuttle is widely used by both the Empire and the
Republic.  Used primarily for medium range ship-to-ship or ship-to-surface
transportation, the Lamada shuttle is very well armed and shielded for
this task.  With shields on par with the <a href=xwing.htm>X-Wing</a>,
and firepower to match, only the shuttles speed and maneuverability keep
it from being used in battle.  However, these ships do fight if necessary,
and in large groups, can quickly cut through entire wings of starfighters.
