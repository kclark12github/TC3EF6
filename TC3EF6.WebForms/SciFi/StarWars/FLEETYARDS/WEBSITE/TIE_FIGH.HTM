Perhaps the most plentiful craft in the Galaxy, the TIE fighter remains
the mainstay of Imperial Naval Aviation.  Designed for short-range
missions, its primary role is to engage enemy starfighters.  Used for
everything from harassment to raiding to escorts, the TIE fighter is only
effective in large numbers, due to its lack of shields.
