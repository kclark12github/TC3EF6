<hr><h1>Y-Wing Training Mission - Easy</h1><hr></center></body> <BR><BR>


<P>
This mission will effectively use the powerful weapons mounted on the 
Y-Wing.  The Y-Wings lack of speed will be neutralized with equally slow 
opponents.<P>

On it's way to the Outer Rim, the Freedom has encountered an Imperial 
convoy.  Four Corellian Corvettes are escorting a flotila of twelve bulk 
freighters.  Intelligence reports that the freighters may be carrying 
supplies of war.  The capture of these supplies would not only hurt the 
Empire, but would also aid in the Freedom's mission.<P>

The convoy is making a short stop at a nearby outpost to refuel.  You, 
Gold Leader, have been ordered to jump in ten minutes ahead of the 
Freedom.  Destroy any war ships in the area.  Identify all freighters and 
containers, then disable them for pickup by the Freedom.  Once the area 
has been secured, fall into a holding pattern and await the Freedom.  
There should be no snags in this mission, but good luck anyways, and may 
the Force(TM) be with you.<P>
