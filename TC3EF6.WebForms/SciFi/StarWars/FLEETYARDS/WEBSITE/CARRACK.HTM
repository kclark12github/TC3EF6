<p>  The smallest ships that can be called curisers today are the old,
obsolescent Carrack Cruisers. They looke sort of like wide versions of the
Strike Criuser, but are much slower and weaker. Still, it does make do,
and it is very well shielded and armored for its class. This ship is found
in escort roles, border patrols, and by insystem police. Some are also
found in the hands of merchants and pirates (not surprising, is it?)
