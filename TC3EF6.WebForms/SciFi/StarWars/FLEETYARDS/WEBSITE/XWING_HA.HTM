<hr><h1>X-Wing Training Mission - Hard</h1><hr></center></body> <BR><BR>


<P>
This mission is hell.  Since the <a 
href="xwing.htm">X-Wing</a> has no major weaknesses, unlike 
other Republic fighters, this mission will simply bury you with enemy 
ships...<P>

Following the destruction of the local Imperial base, a large Imperial 
fleet dropped out of hyperspace directly behind the Freedom.  A flight of 
<a href="tie_bomb.htm">TIE 
Bombers</a> were able to damage the launch bay(s) on the Freedom, 
rendering it helpless.  Twelve X-Wings from Red Squadron, with you in the 
lead, are all the fighter cover that the Freedom has now.  Since the 
route back to Republic space has been closed off, the captain has decided 
to continue with the Freedom's mission to the Outer Rim.  You are to hold 
off all enemy ships long enough for the Freedom to escape, then jump to 
safety to be picked up.  Good luck, and may the Force(TM) be with you.<P>
