The Defiance was the first Mon Calamari Star Cruiser specifically build 
for war.  All of the Star Cruisers before it were luxury liners 
retro-fitted with weapons.  Although this fact is never stated, it seems 
to make sense, since the ship is still in service ten years after the 
Battle of Endor, where it was only one of two ships to survive, the <a 
href="independ.htm">Independence</a> begin the other.  It is also assumed that the Defiance is Admiral Ackbar's personal ship, since it is known that he did not direct the Battle of Endor from his pe






rsonal vessel. <p>
		

The Defiance remains as the flagship of the New 
Republic Fleet, following a glorious career during the Rebellion.  
Alliance pilots launch off of the Defiance in the LucasArts game, 
X-Wing.
