<P><P>
This mission will take advantage of the speed and maneuverability of the 
<a 
href="awing.htm">A-Wing</a>.  
You will be an advanced scout for the Freedom.<P>

The Freedom has just arrived at the Outer Rim.  Blue Squadron, led by 
you, has been sent ahead to scout for Imerial forces.  If you encounter 
any enemy fighters, you have permission to engage and destroy them.  If 
you run into any capital ships, mine fields, or Imperial instellations, 
return to the Freedom and report.  Good luck, and may the Force(TM) be 
with you.<P>
