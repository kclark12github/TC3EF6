The Star Wing, better known as the Assault Gunboat, was the second ship in
a line of "next generation" TIEs, following the <a
href=tie_adva.htm>TIE Advanced</A>.  However, the Gunboat is almost
the exact opposite of the Advanced.  Slow and bulky as opposed to fast and
manuverable, the Gunboat also has extreamly thick shielding.  Armed with
warhead launchers, dual lasers, and dual ion cannons, the Gunboat is
extreamly versitile.  It can be used to disable ships, attack and destroy
capital ships, and be used as a space superiority fighter.  With its
shields, armor, and wide array of weapons, the Gunboat is a fearsome
opponent, and a near match for our <a href=bwing.htm>B-Wing</A>.
