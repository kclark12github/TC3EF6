<hr><h1>Cathedral of Wind on Vortex</h1><hr>

<P>
The Cathedral of Wind is a towering structure, made largely out of crystal.  Resembling a large pipe organ, it has dozens, perhaps hundreds of crystal cylinders of various size.  In order to conduct a symphony, dozens of Vors circle the Cathedral, coverin



g the various openings with their hands or bodies.  The rest of the music comes from the high winds on the planet Vortex.  Although both elements are extremely random, it seems to create excellent music, making this one of the best musical performances in



 the galaxy.
<P>
The Cathedral was inadvertently destroyed by Admiral Ackbar when his sabotaged B-Wing plunged into it, killing several Vors in the process.  The Cathedral was rebuilt, more streamlined, and by no particular plans.  Following this tragedy, the Cathedral wa



s reopened and off-worlders were allowed to hear the concert for the first time since the Emperors New Order was imposed.  Special guests included the Solo family, Admiral Ackbar, Winter, C3PO, Chewbacca, Wedge Antilles and Qwi Xux.
