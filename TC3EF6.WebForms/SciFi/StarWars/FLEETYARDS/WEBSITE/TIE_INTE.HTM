The TIE Interceptor is the Imperial counter-part to the A-Wing.  It is
faster and more maneuverable than the TIE Fighter, as well as more
heavily armed and armored.  This was the first improvement to the original
TIE design in a long time.  However, the radical advancement of technology
has shown the Empire's ability to advance weapons designs quickly and
effectively.
