<P>

This planet has had a more glorious past than present, having a human 
civilization for over 10,000 years.  Two non-htman races also live on 
Corellia, the Selonians and the Drall.  In the past, Corellia was known 
for its massive shipyards and fine military cadets.  As of late, however, 
the planet has been looted and sacked from within, making it generally 
poorer and more run-down than the other "civilized" planets.

The New Repubic took this planet, after the Emperor died, and emplaced a 
governor there as its representative.  In a brief quest for power, 
Thraken-Sal Solo tried to take control of the entire Corellian system, 
but was thwarted by his cousin, Han Solo, and his friends.

After that incident, the New Republic has seen the work that 
needs to be done in Corellia, and has begun to rebuild this once proud 
planet. </p>
