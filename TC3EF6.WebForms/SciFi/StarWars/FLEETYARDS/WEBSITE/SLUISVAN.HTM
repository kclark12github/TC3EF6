<hr><h1>Battle of Sluis Van</h1><hr>
</center>
</body>

<P>
This is the first major assault by Grand Admiral Thrawn against the Republic.  Realizing his need for additional capital ships in large numbers, Thrawn devises a plan to capture New Republic Star Cruisers for his own use.  First, he coordinated hit-and-fa

de attacks on several systems in the Sluis sector, causing heavy damage, but few casualties.  This created a need for heavy cargo hauling capabilities, which the Republic did not have.  After attempts to recruit smugglers failed, stripped down Mon Calamar

i Star Cruisers were used as cargo haulers, completing phase one of Thrawn's plan.  
<P>
Next, Thrawn began to utilize and perfect two pieces of weaponry.  The first was a cloaking device, the schematics of which were located in Mount Tantiss.  The first cloaking device build was installed on a battered old A-class bulk freighter.  The second

 piece of weaponry was a vehicle which could tunnel through the hull of capital ships.  He found such vehicles at the mining operation of Lando Calrissian, on the super-hot world of Nkllon.  After capturing 50 of Calrissian's 'mole miners,' his attack on 

Sluis Van was ready to begin.
<P>
Assembled three-thousandths of a light-year out from Sluis Van was the Imperial task force listed below.  The freighter, loaded with forty TIE fighters and fifty mole miners, each loaded with five stormtroopers, activated its cloak and proceeded to the sh

ipyards.  Upon arriving at Sluis Van, it contacted Sluis Control, claming to be the freighter Nartissteu, out of Nellac Kram.  It clamied that it was jumped by pirates, and was forced to dump its load.  It was at this time that Wedge Antilles ordered Rogu

e Squadron to launch and investigate.
<P>
As Rogue Squadron approached, the freighter exploded, revealing its cloaked cargo.  The TIE's poured out to engage the Republic defenders while the mole miners moved to begin subjugation of ships.  At this time, the Millennium Falcon, with Han Solo, Luke 

Skywalker, Lando Calrissian, C3PO, R2D2, and Skywalker's X-Wing in tow cleared the outer system and moved in to help Rogue Squadron.  The remainder of the Imperial task force also arrived, engaging the perimeter defenses of the shipyards.
<P>
As the battle raged on, Antilles and those on-board the Falcon realized the Imperial plan, and tried to devise a counter-plan to stop it.  First, the remaining unattached cones were hunted down and destroyed.  Then, those ships already captured were hamme

red in an attempt to disable them.  After unsuccessfully trying to disable individual ships with the Falcon's quad batteries, Solo devised a new plan.  Using Calrissian's access codes for the mole miners, they simply activated all of the miners, turning t

hem on full power.  Still attached near the command modules of all the captured ships, the plasma jets of the mole miners burned through sensitive control equipment, and the stormtroopers which had boarded the craft.  This maneuver disabled all of the cap

tured craft, forcing Thrawn to begin a withdrawal.  This battle turned out to be a tactical loss for Thrawn, failing to capture the desired craft.  However, it was a strategic loss for the Republic, with the loss of several of their capital ships for seve

ral months.
