<P>
This mission will take advantage of the X-Wing's balance of strength and
agility.  The mission will implement light dogfightering and simple
bombing.<P>


The Freedom is headed to the Outer Rim.  While in hyperspace, it has 
detected a large mass.  Stopping in a nearby system to investigate, a 
disabled Imperial Star Destroyer has been found.  Captain Isteak believes 
that this is the perfect chance to captures one of these behemoths.  
Plans have been made to take the ship intact back to the Republic.<P>

The first stage in this operation is to cut it off from help.  Repair 
crews have already been sent from a nearby Imperial base, so we must move 
fast.  A flight of 6 X-Wings have been sent in to wipe out the Imperial 
convoy.<P>

You will be lead the X-Wings.  Jump in and destroy all freighters and 
shuttles.  Watch for escorts, the Empire will defend these valuable and 
vulnerable ships fiercely.  Expect heavy TIE Fighter resistance.  Good 
luck.<P>
