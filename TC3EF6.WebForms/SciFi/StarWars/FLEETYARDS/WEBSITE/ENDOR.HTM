<hr><h1>Battle of Endor</h1><hr>

</body>

<P>
Quite possibly the most decisive battle in the Galactic Civil War, the Battle of Endor saw the destruction of the Death Star mark II and the death of Emperor Palpatine.  There was also the destruction of the Executor, whose absence paved the way for a rou


te of the disoriented Imperial Navy.
<P>
The Battle of Endor was planned as a surprise attack by both the Empire and the Alliance.  Upon learning of the location of the Death Star mark II, the Alliance planned an attack on it with the combined Alliance fleet.  However, the location of the Death 






Star was intentionally leaked to the Alliance by the Emperor, in an attempt to trap and destroy the Rebel Fleet.  As the Rebel Fleet massed near Sullust, the Emperor gathered his Fleet on the far side of the Endor moon.  The opening sequences of the battl






e preceded according to the Emperors plans, but went awry as the battle progressed.
<P>
The opening move of the battle was made on the part of the Alliance, with a captured Imperial shuttle.  This shuttle, loaded with Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa, C3PO, R2D2, Chewbacca, and Page's commandos penetrated Imperial defenses and landed on






 Endor.  Their mission was to deactivate the deflector shield which protected the Death Star.  Their initial attempt to destroy the facility was stopped by a legion of the Emperors best stormtroopers.  This delay trapped the Rebel Fleet, which was in orbi






t around Endor, waiting for the fall of the deflector.  Then, the hidden Imperial Fleet made its presence felt, launching all TIE fighters and moving to prevent the escape of the Rebel Fleet.  Thus began, in earnest, the Battle of Endor.
<P>
After the Rebel raiding party was captured on Endor, the native Ewoks attacked the Imperials, and a vicious ground battle ensued.  Many Ewoks were killed, along with nearly all of the Imperial troops there.  Only after Chewbacca, with the help of two Ewok






s, captured an Imperial AT-ST walker did the tide of the ground battle turn.  In the mean time, the Rebel Fleet was struggling to stay alive long enough to attack the Death Star.  Then, the Emperor ordered the superlaser on the incomplete battle station t






o be fired.  A Rebel <a href="cruiser.htm">Mon Calamari Star Cruiser</a> was instantly incinerated, to the shock and dismay of the Alliance.
<P>
Realizing that the Death Star was in fact operational, Admiral Ackbar prepared to retreat.  However, General Lando Calrissian was able to persuade him to give the raiding party on the surface more time.  As the tide began to turn, Solo devised a plan to t






rick the commander of the shield generator into opening the back door.  The plan succeeded and the Rebel raiding party captured the shield facilities and begin to plan explosives.  Minutes later, they detonate, destroying the deflector shield, and paving 






the way for the Rebel Fleet.
<P>
Upon watching the readouts on the deflector shield go down, Calrissian ordered all remaining fighters in his strike group to follow him in.  They entered a service shaft in the surface of the Death Star, with TIE fighters and interceptors in hot pursuit. 






 As they locked onto the strongest power source, which was assumed to be the red reactor, an X-Wing fell prey to the pursuing interceptors.  Calrissian then ordered a few of the fighters to break off and head for the surface, hopefully leading a few of th






e fighters away.
<P>
At this point, Ackbar realized that the fighter attack may succeed, but that the Fleet may not survive, regardless.  Hence, he ordered all firepower concentrated on the Super Star Destroyer Executor.  Waves of Rebel craft attacked the bridge shield genera






tors of the Executor, eventually destroying them.  Then, a single A-Wing sacrificed itself, ramming at full speed into the bridge of the Executor, causing it to spin out of control and fall into the incomplete Death Star.  The sudden death of the Executor






 and the subsequent lack of its leadership cause the Imperial Navy to fall into disarray, giving the Rebel Fleet a decisive advantage.
<P>
Minutes later, the Falcon, flown by Calrissian, and a lone X-Wing, piloted by Wedge Antilles, arrived at the heart of the Death Star.  Antilles put a few shots into the northern power conduit while the Falcon blasted the main reactor.  With the X-Wing in 






the lead and the Falcon in tow, the two ships raced through the Death Star, a couple interceptors still in pursuit.  As the X-Wing cleared the dying Death Star, the pursuing interceptor was consumed by the consuming explosion, the Falcon only seconds away






 from a similar fate.  As it cleared the Death Star in the nick of time, racing towards the gathered Rebel Fleet, the giant battle station was completely consumed by the explosion.  The remainder of the Imperial Navy retreated in complete disarray, shatte






red and leaderless.
