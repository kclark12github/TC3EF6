<P>
The raid on the Imperial base was a total success!  All Imperial ships 
were captured or destroyed.  Additionally, the Freedom fully replenished 
it's supplies, enabling it to proceed to the Outer Rim non-stop.<P>

You are flying an X-Wing, patrolling the system while the Freedom 
completes cargo transfer from the Imperial base.  Through interrogation of 
Imperials on the station, Intelligence has concluded that a large task 
force is due to arrive for resuppling and refitting.  Captain Isteak
plans to lay a trap for the task force, hopefully damaging enough of it to 
neutralize the threat.  Stay alert during the patrol, the task force may 
arrive at any time.  If hostile Imperial forces do arrive, 6
additionaly X-Wings from Green Squadron stand ready to assist.  Good
luck.<P>

(7/29/96)Also, on your way out, wipe out the Imperial Docks.  We wouldn't
want to leave the Empire anything useful...<P>
