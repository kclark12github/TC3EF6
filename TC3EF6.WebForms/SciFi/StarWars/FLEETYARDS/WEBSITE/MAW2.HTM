<P>
 The Maw, as it is commonly known, is a collection of thousands of black
holes, creating a vast disturbance in space.  Located near the planet of
Kessel, known for its glitterstim, the Maw was an obstacle to smugglers
working out of Kessel.  Forced to pass close to the Maw, this became known
as the Kessel run.  The fastest Kessel run recorded was made by Han Solo,
in *******.  This record was then broken by Boshek, in his ship the
Infinity, with a time .1
parsecs better than Solos.  <P> In the heart of the Maw rests the Maw
Installation, an
asteroid structure housing the Imperial think tank. Created by Grand Moff
Tarkin, the purpose of the Installation was to develop weapons of mass
destruction for the Empire.  Among the creations from the Installation are
the Death Star, World Devastater, and the Sun Crusher.  Tarkin also
assigned four Imperial Star Destroyers, the Hydra, Manticore, Basilisk,
and Gorgon, under the command of Admiral Daala.  <P> This Installation was
taken, years later, by the New Republic.  A task force of one frigate and
four Corellian Corvettes was sent, under the command of Wedge Antilles, to
capture the Maw Installation.  While the invasion was taking place,
Admiral Daala returned to the Installation with her one remaining
Destroyer.  Tol Sivron also returned to the Installation with his Death
Star prototype, as did Luke Skywalker and Kyp Durron in the Sun Crusher.
In a climatic battle, the prototype was destroyed, along with the Sun
Crusher.  Admiral Daala and her last Destroyer, supposedly dead, escaped
the Maw, seeking out the remaining Imperial forces in the Galaxy with the
valuable weapons designs she possessed.
