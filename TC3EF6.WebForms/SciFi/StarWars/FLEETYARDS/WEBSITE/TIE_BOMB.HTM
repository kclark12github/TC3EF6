<P>
The TIE Bomber is the most heavily armed and armored of the older
generation of TIEs.  Specifically designed to deliver as much firepower as
possible, the Bomber is armed with over 8 torpedoes.  Heavily
armored, it can withstand several volleys of laser fire from nearly any
starfighter out there.  However, all of its weapons and armor make it an
extreamly slow ship.  Subsequently, its top speed make it perfect for
target practice by most Republic starfighters.  But be warned, it may be
difficult to stop a large flight of these ships.
