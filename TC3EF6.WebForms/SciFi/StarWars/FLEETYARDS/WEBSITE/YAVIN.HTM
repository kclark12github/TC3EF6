The first major victory of the Rebel Alliance over the Empire, this battle saw the destruction of the first Death Star.  Upon the discovery of the hidden Rebel base on Yavin IV, through a hidden homing beacon on the Millennium Falcon, the Death Star was m





oved into the system in preparation for a final strike.  Upwards of thirty
Rebel <a href="xwing.htm">X-Wings</a> and three <a href="ywing.htm">Y-Wings</a> made



 a desperate strike at the Death Star as it prepared to destroy Yavin IV.  Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles were two of the pilots who participated in the attack.
<P>
Upon approaching the Death Star, the starfighters had to first pass through the magnetic field.  Next, the X-Wings cut across the equator, drawing turbolaser fire, while the Y-Wings entered the trench.  While the Y-Wings approached the exhaust port, which





 was the primary target, the X-Wings began to engage the turbolaser towers, which covered the Death Star.  Minutes later, <a href="tie_figh.htm">Imperial TIE fighters</a> launched from Death Star to engag





e the Rebels.  Darth Vader, piloting his personal starfighter, led two other TIE fighters into the trench, in pursuit of the Rebel Y-Wings.  The three Y-Wings were promptly destroyed, without firing a shot at the exhaust port.
<P>
Next, Red leader led two X-Wings in for a second try.  This attempt was also destroyed by the three TIE fighters in the trench.  Finally, Skywalker, along with Antilles and Darklighter entered the trench.  First, Antilles was hit and forced to pull out of





 the trench.  Next, Darklighter was destroyed with a well placed shot in the rear.  Finally, Vader targeted Skywalker's X-Wing, briefly commenting that "the Force is strong with this one."  Just as he obtains a positive lock and says "I have you now," the





 Millennium Falcon blazed out of nowhere, incinerating one escort and hitting the other, knocking Vader out of the trench (and to safety.)  This gave Skywalker a clear shot at the trench, which he took, sending a pair of proton torpedoes down the exhaust 





shaft, detonating the core.  The Falcon, and two X-Wings then returned to the Rebel base on Yavin IV.  Han Solo and Luke Skywalker were then decorated with the Star of Alderaan, the Alliances highest decoration.
