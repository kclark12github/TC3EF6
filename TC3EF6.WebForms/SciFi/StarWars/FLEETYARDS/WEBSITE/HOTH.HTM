<P>
Upon being uprooted from their hidden Yavin base, the Rebel Alliance sought a new location from which to operate.  After three years of searching, the ice world of Hoth was chosen, and Echo Base was established.  Facilities for servicing Rebel starfighter




s were established, along with a power generator, a ground based ion cannon and laser cannons, and a deflector shield.  Tauntauns, native beasts, were used as a means of travel and patrol in the cold weather, before the land speeders were adapted to the c




old climate.  Han Solo was riding a tauntaun when he located the Imperial probe which landed on Hoth, and subsequently alerted the Imperials to the Rebel presence on the planet.
<P>
Upon hearing of the probe, and possible transmissions to the Imperial Fleet, General Rieeken ordered the evacuation process to begin.  Within hours, the Executor and five Imperial Star Destroyers,  had arrived to exterminate the base and end the Rebellion




.  However, the Fleet dropped out of hyperspace too early, allowing Echo Base to raise its deflector shields.  Admiral Oczel was executed by Darth Vader for incompetence, and the newly promoted Admiral Piett was ordered to place a blockade on the planet. 




 A ground assault was then launched, consisting of 3 AT-AT walkers and several AT-ST walkers.  Echo base responded by deploying ground troops and manning laser turrets in anticipation of the attack.  Rouge Squadron was also launched, flying snow speeders,




 to aid in the defense of Echo Base.  Evacuation procedures were also stepped up, with the ion cannon firing suppression shots, clearing the way for the fleeing transports and covering <a href="xwing.htm">X-




Wings</a>.  One Imperial Star Destroyer was subsequently ionized and disabled by fire from the ion cannon.
<P>
As the AT-AT walkers approached, laser fire laid out by ground troops and turrets were unable to penetrate the thick armor of the walkers.  The snow speeders then moved in, but were similarly unable to harm the walkers with lasers.  Luke Skywalker then de




vised a plan to use the snow speeders tow cable to wrap the four legs of the AT-AT together, thus tripping it.  However, his own gunner was dead, so Skywalker ordered another member of Rogue Squadron to attack.  One AT-AT was successfully destroyed in thi




s fashion, leaving two.  Another attempt to trip a second AT-AT failed, with the destruction of two snow speeders, including that of Skywalker.  However, before escaping the doomed speeder, Skywalker pulled his fathers lightsaber, a tow cable, and a concu




ssion grenade from the speeder.  He then fired the cable at the underside of a second AT-AT, pulling himself up to the belly of the vehicle.  Using his lightsaber, he cut open an access hatch and threw the concussion grenade in, dropping away seconds late




r.  This attack brought the second AT-AT to its knees.
<P>
However, the leader of the assault was able to survive the Rebel counter-attack, opening fire on the main power generator moments later, destroying it.  The deflector shield was subsequently lowered, allowing the orbiting Destroyers to drop the remainder 




of their landing parties.  As the AT-AT, joined by stormtroopers and AT-ST from the orbiting Destroyers, moved towards the Rebel trenches, the remaining Rebel ground forces began their final pullout.  Skywalker was able to make it back to Echo Base in tim




e to take-off in his waiting X-Wing, heading for the Dagobah system.  Princess Leia Organa escaped, along with C-3PO, Chewbacca, and Han Solo aboard the Millennium Falcon, which was pursued in earnest by Darth Vader.  The remainder of the Alliance was abl




e to escape into deep space, avoiding the wrath of the Imperial Navy once again.
