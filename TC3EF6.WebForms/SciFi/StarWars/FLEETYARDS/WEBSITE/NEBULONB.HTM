<p> These relatively small but powerful craft were built by the Imperials
to stop of the Alliance's formidable fighters... It worked. If you
rem,ember X-Wing, the game, these ships were manuverable, and could pour
as much laser power into oyu as a destroyer could. While this is, of
coure, nmot really the case, the point is that they are still strong
ships. The Alliance captured many of these ships during the war, and many
are still used as escorts to Cruisers and as other roles, like medical
ships.
