Originally manufactured by Telgarn Corporation, the StormTrooper
Transport was designed to do just that, transport StormTroopers.  The
Alliance captured several of these vessels, and employed them in several
of their daring raids on the Empire.  Because of their original design,
they have tough shielding and a nasty array of weapons that could hold
many starfighters at bay.  Equipped with twin laser cannons and dual
torpedo tubes, the transport is also heavily shielded and armored, with
ability to survive a direct torpedo hit.  Subsequently, it can also
survive several seconds of direct laser fire from a starfighter.  However,
the excessive armor and armorment weighs the craft down, leaving it prey
to nearly any ships that wishes to take a shot. 
Like the <a href=shuttle.htm>Lamada Class Shuttle</A>, this vessel is
tough one-on-one, and deadly when in large groups.
