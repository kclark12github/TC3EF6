<p> The 8 kilometer long Super Star Destroyer Executor was built as the
first of the SSTD line. Built for the exclusive use od Darth Vader, it was
presented to him sort of as a consolation prize after the Battle of Yavin.
This powerful vessel was commanded first by Admiral Ozzel, but when Ozzel
was killed by Vader for his incompatence, then Captain Piett was promoted
to Admiral and given the command. Obiviously Piett was good, because he
served as commander of the Executor until the ship's destruction during
the Battle of Endor. After all Alliance craft concentrated their fire on
the large black ship, and the bridge shield generators were brought down
by X-WIng starfighters, a suicidal run by Blue Leader (I'm not sure on
that) finished the ship off when he ran his A-WIng straight into the
bridge, causing the Executor to loose control and fall into the
uncompleted Death Star II. As Captain Pellaeon later correctly noted, the
loss of the Executor not only meant the loss of their most powerful ship,
but it took with it the best and brightest of the Imperial Navy.
