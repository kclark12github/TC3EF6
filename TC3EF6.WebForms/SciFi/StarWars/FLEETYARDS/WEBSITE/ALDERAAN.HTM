Before the Death Star turned it into an astroid belt, Alderaan was one of 
the most beautiful and powerful planets in the Old Republic.  The 
Alderaanians were very environmental, building their cities in little 
niches, being very careful not to disturb the ecosystem.  Hence, 
Alderaans natural beauty was preserved... until the Empire.<P>


During the rise of the Empire, Bail Organa was the Senator of Alderaan to 
the Old Republic Senate.  However, he left the Senate to work Alderaan 
itself.  He then sent his adopted daughter, Leia Organa as his 
representative to the Senate.
