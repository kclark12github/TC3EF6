<hr><h1>Historic Combat Mission 2: Raid On 
Coruscant Docks</h1><hr></center></body> <BR><BR>
 
 
<P>
Following the Battle of Endor, the Alliance sought to quickly knock the 
Empire off balance.  One move towards this goal was the taking of 
Coruscant, the heart of the Empire.  In order to take Coruscant, which 
was heavily defended, multiple raids were first carried out.<P>

The most important of these raids was an attack on the Coruscant Fleet 
Yards.  This instellation serviced the Imperial Home Fleet, which 
defended Coruscant.  Without it, the Fleet would have to go nearly twenty 
light-years from Coruscant to refuel, rearm, and recieve repairs.<P>

Three attacks on neighboring systems were carried out to lure away this 
instellations defenses.  Then, one squadron of X-Wings from Fire Lance 
Squadron was sent in for a 
fast strike.  An Imperial Fleet had arrived just as the docks were being 
finished off, and the X-Wings escaped.  You will be Fire Lance Leader.  
Jump in and smash the repair docks, as well as any Imperial craft there.  
Watch out for the mine field surrounding the docks.  A Star Destroyer 
force will also jump in, so make this a fast kill.  Good luck.<P>
