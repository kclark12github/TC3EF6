The Imperial Star Destroyer is one of the most fearsome ships in space, 
second only to the superweapons constructed by the Empire.  With enough 
turbolasers to lay entire continents to waste, ion cannons to disable 
nearly any target, tractor beams and warhead tubes, it is the mainstay of 
the Imperial Star Fleet.  In addition, it carries six squadrons of TIE 
fighters, which enables it to accomplish nearly any mission, from recon 
to sheer devestation.  The Star Destroyer, with the Imperial March in the 
background, has come to represent the Empire, as well as evil.<P>

<p>  After re-evaluation by Imperial scientists, the Imperial II class of
Star Destroyers were created.  They offer more protection to the
vulnerable shield towers of the vessel, and increased the total firepower.
However, due to the fall of the Empire, not many of these ships were
completed.
