<hr><h1>Y-Wing Training Mission - Hard</h1><hr></center></body> <BR><BR>


<P>
This mission will exploit the slow, unmaneuverable, bulky design of the 
Y-Wing.  You will be forced to fight superior enemy fighters, which will 
push the abilities of the Y-Wing to the limit.<P>

While picking up the supplies from a recent raid, an Imperial Task force 
jumped in fifteen km away from the Freedom.  The Freedom is still docked 
with the Imperial base, and is very vulnerable.  Only five Y-Wings from 
Gold Squadron are in space, led by you.  You must proceed towards the 
Imperial force and delay any fighters which head towards the Freedom.  
The Freedom is proceeding with emergency docking operations and should be 
ready for combat in eight minutes.  Good luck, and may the Force(TM) be 
with you.<P>
