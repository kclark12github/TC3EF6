<p>  These fast, weak vessels were the mainstay of the Rebel fleets early
in the war.  Also called "Blockade Runners", these ships were cheap to
build and hard to catch.  Perfect for courrier missions.  Now they are
made obsolete by Modified Corvettes, and are usually found in the hands of
merchants and pirates.
