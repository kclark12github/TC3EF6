The Independence was the flagship of the Alliance fleet during the height 
of the Rebellion.  Before being prepped for battle, it was a huge luxury 
liner.  Specifically outfitted as a carrier, it carries over six 
squadrons of fighters, which is impressive for Star Cruisers of that time.<P>

In the LucasArt game X-Wing, the Independence was a base of operations 
for the Alliance Fleet.  It, along with the <a 
href="defiance.htm">Defiance</a>, were the only two 
			    
Cruisers to survive the Battle of Endor, the rest being picked off by the 
Death Star superlaser.  After a long career, the Independance was 
retired, and the before mentioned Defiance took the mantle of flagship.
