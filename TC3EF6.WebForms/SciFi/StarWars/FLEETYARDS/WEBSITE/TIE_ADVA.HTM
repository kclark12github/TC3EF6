The TIE Advanced is the first in a line of "next generation" TIE 
fighters.  This new generation is equpped with shielding, thick armor, 
and heavy weapons, in great contrast to the older TIE's.  However, unlike 
the Star Wing (Assult Gunboat), they're also fast.  In short, these ships 
are nightmares for loyal Republic pilots like myself (Raptor.)<P>

Back to the TIE Advanced.  The first TIE Advanced prototype was used by 
Darth Vadar in "A New Hope". during the Death Star trench run over Yavin 
IV.  Vadar picked off three Y-Wings, and a few X-Wings before the 
Millennium Falcon knocked Vadar out of the trench, giving Luke Skywalker 
and his X-Wing a clear shot at an exhaust port.  The pair of proton 
topedos which went down the port destoyed the entire station, securing 
the first major Alliance victory in the war. The production line TIE
Advanced has four lasers (instead of the two that Vader's TIE had), two
"all-purpose" warhead launchers, and a hyperdrive- a TIE Fighter first!<P>                     
                                                                                                                      
Back on topic... the TIE Advanced was simply a nightmare in X-Wing, by 
Lucasart.  About twice as fast as X-Wings, they were basically TIE 
interceptors with heavier weapons, as well as shielding.  The shielding was 
the miserable part.  Before, good marksmanship or a few lucky shots would 
wipe out a TIE.  With the Advanced, a few lucky shots would bang up it's 
shields, which would then re-charge rather quickly.  Hence, a battle with 
one of these in anything less than an A-Wing may take awhile.<P>
