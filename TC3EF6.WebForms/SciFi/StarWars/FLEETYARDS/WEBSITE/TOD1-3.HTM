TOD 1: Mission 3 - Cover Our Pull-Out</H1><HR></center>



<P>
For a quick overview of the mission, click <a

<P>
In this mission, aggressiveness is the key.  Believe it or not, with just
5 X-Wings (including yourself), you can drop a Star Destroyer in a matter
of minutes.
<P>
As soon as you jump in, pour all current laser power into shields, and
divert all possible power to lasers.  Head straight towards the Freedom,
and make a sharp turn to port (the left) as you pass over it.  As you head
away from Freedom, you should be able to see its engines right behind
you.  Continue until the Colossus jumps in.
<P>
When the Colossus appears on your scopes, quickly change your power
settings to your own preferences.  Assign your wing to attack anything
launching from the Colossus.  Your job is to take out the shield towers to
enable an effective strike.  One torpedo, blind fired, followed with a
burst of laser fire is recommended, mainly to save torpedoes.  Blind
firing torpedos can be tricky, and may need to be practiced a few times.
Such runs should be made at high speeds if your shields are low, but you
may be able to afford one sustained run if you have thick shields.
Continue doing this until the shields fall.
<P>
When the shields go down, order your wingmen to attack the Colossus.
Then, sweep in to mop up any TIEs left, taking whatever shots are
convinent.  The Colossus should fall within 3 minutes or so.  Quickly
sweep back towards the Freedom.
<P>
At this time, the Vanguard(s) should be picking the War Hammer apart.  If
the War Hammer does not have its shields down, go in to help.  If not,
form up with your wing and prepare for the Gunboats.  If you have trouble
with Gunboats, hang near the frigates, and they should provide some cover.
<P>
When the Harasser jumps in, ignore them.  There's little to nothing you
can do against frigates, so let the other cap' ships handle them.  Focus
on the Gunboats and any waves of TIE Advanced that come in.  If you can
survive the bombardment of concussion missiles, the Freedom should survive
also.  Good luck.
<P>
