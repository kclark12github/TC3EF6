Ysalamiri seem to have the rare and interesting ability to block the Force, creating bubbles around them where the Force simply does not exist.  Lizard like creatures, which are no more than fifty centimeters long, their claws elongate with time, growing 




into the very trees they inhabit.  Because of their unique ability, the Jedi Knights of the Old Republic left the planet of Myrkr strictly alone, making it an ideal base of operations for smuggler groups, such as that of Talon Karrde.  Grand Admiral Thraw




n made use of the ysalamiri's abilities in several cases.  First, to convince a mad clone of Jedi Master, Joruus C'baoth, to aid him in his fight against the New Republic.  Second, to grow health clones at an alarming and unheard of rate of one every thir




ty days.  This fact was used to crew the Katana Fleet, a force which greatly bolstered Imperial forces and pushed the New Republic to the breaking point.
