<hr><h1>TOD 1: Mission 2</h1><hr></center></body> <BR><BR>


<P>
The advanced scouts from Blue Squadron have discovered an Imperial 
supply convoy supplying a secret base in this sector.  Captain Isteak has
decided to replenish the Freedom's supplies at this base, while at the same time, upsetting 
Imperial operations.  A surprise attack has been planned for this assult.<P>

First, <a
href="awing.htm">A-Wings</a> 
from Blue Squadron will jump in and surpress enemy 
fighters in the area.  Next, <a
href="xwing.htm">X-Wings</a> 
from Red Squadron, led by you, will 
arrive and secure the area.  Finally, <a
href="ywing.htm">Y-Wings</a>
from Gold Squadron will 
arrive to destroy any large ships in the area.  Red Squadron will 
provide cover 
during their attack run and Blue Squadron will hold a defense perimeter, 
in case something... unexpected jumps in.<P>


This mission is going to be one hell of a dogfight.  I hope you're up to
it.<P>
