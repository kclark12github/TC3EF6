Flight instructors at the Training Center are in the process of creating 
training missions for each of the three primary fighters in the New 
Republic Fleet, the X-Wing, A-Wing, and Y-Wing.  Missions for the B-Wing 
will follow later.<P>

In production, for each figher, are two missions.  The first mission is 
well suited for each particular fighter.  In the second mission, you will 
be forced to use each fighter for what it was never meant to do.  Thus, 
the second mission will be far more challenging.  At a later time, an 
impossible mission will be added, just for fun.  Good luck!

<P>
<P>Note: All missions marked with a * are ready to fly.
<P>Note II: Some of these missions are not fair.  Some of them may also 
be impossible.  If you find that it is, please 
<a href=mailto:dchen@binx.mbhs.edu>mail</a> me and we'll fix it.  Thanx.

Note: After some adjustment, the training missions are no longer in 
chronological order.  A few of the briefings may also be a bit screwy.
