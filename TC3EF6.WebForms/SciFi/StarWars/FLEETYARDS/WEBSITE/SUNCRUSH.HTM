The Sun Crusher, featured in Keven J. Anderson's Jedi Academy trilogy, 
was a superweapon which triggered supernova's in any star (except the 
Death Star :)  Developed by scientists in the Maw Instellation, it was 
stolen in an escape from the Instellation by Han Solo, Chewbacca, Kyp 
Durron, and Qwi Xux, the inventor.  As they escaped from the 
Instellation, Han drove the Sun Crusher through one of the four Star 
Destroyers guarding the Instellation.  The ship tumbled out of control 
and into one of the black holes that comprise the Maw.  They then escaped 
and took the superweapon back to the Republic.
