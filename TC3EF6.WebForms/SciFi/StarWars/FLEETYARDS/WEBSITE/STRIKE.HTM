<p>  These fast, relatively strong vessels were never intended to be Main
Assault units, but still play an important support role. Noting the large
number of weapons and tractor beams, but sparse fighter protection, it is
easy to tell that this is a combat starship, and not a carrier. In combat,
its tough armor and small size (this thing is really thin) make it a
formidable opponent.
