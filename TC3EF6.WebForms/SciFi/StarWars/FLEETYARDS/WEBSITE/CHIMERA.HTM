 <p>



The Chimera was involved in many of the Empire's campaigns, earning 
itself and its crew many decorations and honors.  The Captian of the 
Chimera was killed in the Battle of Endor, along with his executive 
officer.  Liutenant Commander Pellaeon took command of the ship, and 
ordered the hasty retreat on that monumental day.

The now Captain Pellaeon has been fighting the New Republic since, with 
little success.  Then, Captain Pellaeon heard of Grand Admiral Thrawn's 
return, and offered his ship as a flagship.  Thrawn accepted, and the 
Chimera served as his flagship until his death.  It is assumed that the 
Chimera did survive Thrawn's final battle, although no one knows where it 
fled to.
