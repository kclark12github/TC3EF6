<hr><h1>A-Wing Training Mission - Hard</h1><hr></center></body> <BR><BR>


<P><P>
This mission will be the greatest nightmare for any A-Wing pilot.  The 
thin shields and light weaponry of the A-Wing will now be put to the 
test.<P>

Following the discovery of a massive Imperial Fleet orbiting the 
planet Latus, the Freedom launched all of its fighters in a full forced 
assult.  The A-Wings were held in a point-defense grid near the Freedom.  
The remaining <a 
href="xwing.htm">X-Wings</A> 
and <a 
href="ywing.htm">Y-Wings</a> 
were sent in, and completely 
destroyed.  Now, the twelve A-Wings of Blue Squadron are all that 
stands between the Freedom and an Imperial task force.<P>

Your job is to hold the squadron together and fend off the approching 
TIE's.  Before begin destroyed, the X-Wings were able to eliminate a good 
number of <a 
href="tie_figh.htm">TIE 
Fighters</a> and <a 
href="tie_inte.htm">TIE Inteceptors</a>, 
leaving only the Bombers for you 
to deal with.  Dispatch with the Bombers quickly, then head out to delay 
the approching Imperial ships.  Sensors have detected a flight of 12 
Corellian Corvettes, with a pair of Destroyers running behind them.  The 
Freedom will be able to outrun the Destroyers, but you will have to deal 
with the Corvettes before they close with the Freedom.  Once the Freedom 
jumps to safety, re-form your squadron and proceed to the rendevouze 
point to be picked up.  The Freedom is depending on you.  Good luck, and 
may the Force(TM) be with you.<P>

Note: There are reports that the Imperial Commander operating in this 
region aquired the design specs for the <a 
href="tie_adva.htm">TIE 
Advanced</a>.  Be warned, these 
fighters may appear, launching from the trailing <a

Destroyers</a>.  Stay on your guard.
