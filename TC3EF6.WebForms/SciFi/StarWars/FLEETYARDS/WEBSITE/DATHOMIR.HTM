<P>
As the Heros of the Rebellion escaped from the interdicted planet of
Dathomir, they find a fleet of Hapan Battle Dragons fighting Warlord
Zsinj's fleet of Destroyers.  One Battle Dragon, on the outskirts of the
battle, seeded hyperspace with pulsemass generators, preventing any ships
from entering hyperspace for ten to fifteen minutes, stranding both fleets
there.
<P>
Upon arriving, the Millenium Falcon moved to attack the Iron Fist,
Zsinj's Star Destroyer.  After begin pulled in by the tractor beam, it
broke free, and moved up towards the command bridge.  After dumping its 
two remaining Arakyds concussion missles into the bridge, the shields
on the Iron Fist went down.  Seconds later, two flanking Battle Dragons 
poured proton torpedoes into the Destroyer, annihilating it.  Imperial
craft, leaderless, began to surrender.  The Hapan fleet preped these
Destroyers to be taken back to the Hapan star cluster.  Zsinj's orbiting
docking fasilaties were destroyed, along with the ships trapped there.
This battle marked the downfall of the most powerful Imperial warlord left
in the Galaxy, paving the way for several more star systems to be taken by
the New Republic.
