Glittering in space like its namesake, the corusca gem, Coruscant has 
been the center of galactic attention for the last 10,000 years.  The 
original capital of the Old Republic, this planet the also the Empire's 
seat of power, and later the capital of the New Republic.  Coruscant no 
longer has a "ground level" with 10,000 years of buildings being built on 
top of each other, and only the brave (or stupid) willing to go down 
very far.  Dominating the impressive skyline of Imperial City (once 
called Galactic City), the capitol of Coruscant, is the Emperor's 
Palace.  Arguably the tallest building in history, the sprawling former 
home of the Emperor now houses the entire New Republic senate, 
transforming it from a "white house" to a "capitol.

At Statuary Park, visitors can actually touch the ground of Courscant, 
which used to be the tip of a mountain.  Another attraction are the snow 
covered ????? mountains to the north, which offer the latest line of 
turbo-skiing. </p>
