<p> The MC80 was originally a luxury liner that was retrofitted for war
during the Galactic Civil War.  Its sucess as an effective fighting craft
(almost the equal of a star destroyer) and the subsequent retrofitting of
the rest of the sizeable Mon Cal. fleet was pivital to the eventual
victory of the New Republic fleet. An interesting note about these huge
craft is that no two ships are the same, each one being built around the
captain's specefications.  This must be hell to service, but provides for
a powerful and unpredictable foe in battle.

<p> After the Galactic Civil war, the engineers at Mon Calamari decided to
abandon the idea of retrofitting old luxury liners and started to build
pure warships.  The firt of this line is the current Flagship of the New
Republic fleet: the Defiance. These ships sport stronger shields and armor
and weapons than their predessesors. Build for speed and power, these
vessels are actually MORE powerful than a standard Imperial Star
Destroyer. An interesting note is that these ships were build so that,
unlike the original Calamari Cruisers, they can be crewed by any race in
the New Republic. These ships are currently the most powerful vessels in
the New Republic Fleet.
