The ocean planet of Mon Calamari contains of little land.  Therefore, the 
sentient life that formed, the Mon calamari and the Quarren, evolved from 
the sea.  The planet has a rich ecosystem in the ocean, consisting of 
corals, whales, squids, and various forms of fish.  Predator species such 
as the dreaded Krakana are also found here.

Calamari have made their homes in the form of giant floating cities, with 
half of the structure being above the water, and half being below, these 
structures are crafted like all other Calamarian equipment: sleek, 
organic, and like a work of art. Visitors can visit the many beautiful 
cities and take nature tours of Calamari's ocean.  The latest in boating 
and water skiing is also found here.

The Empire originally took this planet, but the Calamarians rallied, and 
the occupatipon was overthrown.  Later, The reborn Emperor nearly ravaged 
the surface of the planet with his fleet of world devastators.  The 
planet was, however, saved by the New Republic in the action known as the 
Battle of Mon Calamari.  Most recently, the planet was attack again by 
Admiral Daala and her fleet of three Star Destroyers.  With the tactical 
genious of Admiral Ackbar (a Mon Calamarian), one of the destroyers was 
destroyed in exchange for the skeleton of a Calamari Cruiser.

Mon Calamari has repaired its damage, and its impressive technology and 
fleet yards have come to make it be called the "heart of the alliance".
