Created from the mind 
of a beautiful Imperial researcher, the Sun 
Crusher was among the most fearsome of the Empire's weapons.  Armed with 
resonance torpedos, each one of these projectiles had the ability to 
cause ANY star to go nova.  Protected with quantum armor, it was nearly 
completely impervious to laser fire.  The only weapon which could harm it 
was the superlaser of the Death Star.  Additionally, it was equipped with 
six regular laser cannons at each corner of the ship, for defensive 
measures.<P>

Smaller than an X-Wing starfighter, the Sun Crusher was used by Kyp 
Durran, a rouge Jedi, to destroy the fleet of Admiral Daala.  Daala, who 
commanded four Destroyers, was assigned by Grand Moff Tarkin to protect 
the Maw Instellation.  As the Sun Crusher was stolen by Kyp, Han Solo, 
and Chewbacca, Daala gave chase.  She then vowed to destroy the New 
Republic on her own, only to be dealt three crushing defeats, each 
costing her a destroyer.  In a final explosive battle, Daala took her 
last Destroyer back to the Maw, where she made battle with a small 
Republic Fleet, the Sun Crusher, and the Death Star prototype.  When the 
smoke cleared, both super-weapons, as well as Daala's Destroyer, appeared 
to be gone...<P>

The quantum armor and resonance torpedos were researched and built by the 
Imperial scientist Qwi Xux.  Living in the secret Imperial think tank 
lying deep in the Maw cluster, she also helped to design the superlaser 
on all three of the Death Stars.<P>

These events are depicted in Kevin J. Anderson's Jedi Academy Trilogy.<P>
