<p> One of the Empire's most ingenious inventions, the Interdictor Cruiser
uses to shell of a old Victory Star Destroyer.  With four gravity well
projectors, it can serve two roles. First, it prevents any ships nearby
from entering hyperspase. Second, any ships traveling through hyperspace
will be dragged out automatically because the navigation systems will
believe that the vessel is close to a planet.  Due to this unique ability,
Interdictors are used in many ambush operations and were a favorite tool
of Grand Admiral Thrawn.
