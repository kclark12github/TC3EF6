<hr><h1>TOD 1: Mission 1</h1><hr></center></body> <BR><BR>


<P>
The Freedom has been sent to scout the Outer Rim for potential Republic 
bases.  You are the Wing Commander on board the Freedom, with the primary 
mission of defending the Freedom against any enemy attacks.<P>

The Freedom is still three days from it's initial destination.  An 
Imperial task force has been detected in a nearby system.  The captain has
ordered the 
Freedom to investigate, and a small detachment of <a 
href="awing.htm">A-Wing's</a> 
have been sent to investigate.<P>

Your mission is to scout for enemy ships.  If you encounter any fighters, 
you have permission to engage and destroy them.  If you find any capital 
ships, identify them and return to the Freedom to prepare for a strike.  
Good luck, and may the Force(TM) be with you.<P>
