The A-Wing is the Republic's fastest, most manuverable ship.  Designed by 
General Jan Dodonna, it was modeled after the snow speeders the Alliance 
used on Hoth.  Built to counter the new TIE Inteceptor.  Armed with twin 
laser cannons and duel concussion missle tubes, the A-Wing was built as a 
dogfighter and inteceptor.  What the Y-Wing and B-Wing accomplish through 
brute force, the A-Wing does through finese.<P>
