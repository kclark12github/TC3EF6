This planet is inhabited by a group of survivors.  After a droid 
malfunction almost killed all of the original colonists, the Bakur 
Corperation started to cononize the land.  Filled with lush vegetation 
and and incredibe vein of quartz, the Bakurans founded their capitol 
between two rivers, calling it Salis Da'ar.

Bakura exports chiefly repulsorlifts from its large factory, and also a 
delicious candy and necter from the Namana trees.  The fruit exhibit a 
chemical that induces a faint sence of pleasure, causing it to be quite 
habit forming.  Bakura was recently under attack by a reptillian race 
known as the Ssi-Ruuk, who use living energies as power for their 
machines.  The invasion was repulsed in the end, and was later dubbed the 
Battle of Bakura. </p>

-Bakura has, as of late, gathered a significant fleet for its home 
defence, due to its remoteness from the New Republic, and the constant 
threat of the Ssi-Ruuk.
