The Y-Wing was the heavy bomber for the Alliance.  It has now been all 
but replaced by the B-Wing, and is rarely used by the Republic.  Except 
for the B-Wing, the Y-Wing can still outgun any starfighter in the 
Fleet.  Armed with a pair of laser cannons and another pair of ion 
cannons, it also packs eight proton torpedoes, which can deliver quite a 
punch.  Although slow and unmaneuverable, it has enough shielding and 
armor to keep most pilots live long enough to carry out their mission.  
However, old technology has grounded this fighter.  Only pirate and 
smuggler groups use the Y-Wing on a large scale now.<P>
