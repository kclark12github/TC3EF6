<p>An idea that sprund into the minds of those ever-busy Mon Calamari
scientists was "Why not build a ship that is stronger than a frigate, but
still easily built?" Their answer was the MC70 class.  These ships are
very fast, and well armed for their size, but do not sport heavy shielding
or armor. It usually relies on it 4 fighter wings to help it out of any
sticky situation it lands in. Still, it is a midsized cruiser and fills
a class that was empty for a long time.
