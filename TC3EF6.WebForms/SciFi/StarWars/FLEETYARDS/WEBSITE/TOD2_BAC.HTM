Following the recent Imperial incurrsions into Republic space, the Senate 
has approved the construction of a new fleet to combat this threat.  At 
the head of the research team for this project is Qwi Xux, the brilliant 
Imperial scientist rescued from the Maw Instellation.  She has been 
developing advanced laser and targeting systems, as well as a newer, 
smaller, and faster hyperdrive which could be mounted on the advanced new 
starfighter, the V-Wing.<P>

The Fleet has ordered the construction of new fleet yards and research 
centers to facilitate the new fleet.  A deserted system, located deep 
within the Republic has been choosen.  A dead planet has already been 
selected for all necessary raw materials, and mining equipment is being 
set up.  The fleet yards are being constructed in orbit around the dead 
planet, to cut down on resource transfer time.  Finally, the research center 
will orbit the ninth planet out, a gas giant.  In times of emergency, it will duck into the giant itself.  With 
thin quantum armor, it would be able to stay down there for nearly three 
hours before critical presure is reached.<P>

Needless to say, this facility will be highly sought after, by Imperials, 
pirates, and others who would undermine the security of the Republic.  
Hence, an entire squadron of <a href="heavy_ca.htm">Mon 
Calamari Star Cruisers</a> are being placed on alert in the system until orital battlestations and ground bases 
weapons and shields are in place.  You will be the Wing Commander off of 
the Liberator, the flagship of the defense fleet.  Your primary mission 
during this tour is to protect the system and the valuble facilities that 
it holds.  Your secondary mission is to protect the fleet stationed 
there.  Your last objective it to keep your Wing alive to fight another 
day.  This includes you, so don't do anything stupid.  Good luck.
