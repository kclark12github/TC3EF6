<P>
Nearly five years after the <a 
href="endor.htm">Battle of 
Endor</a>, the last of the Empire's 
warlords rallied the Fleet and drove the Republic back.  One of the 
opening steps in this Grand Admiral's campaigns was to capture Republic 
capital ships for use.  This was accomplished with an attack on Sluis Van.<P>

By hitting nearby systems, as well as Republic shipping lanes, the 
Adrmial was able to force <a 
href="heavy_ca.htm">Mon 
Calamari Star Cruisers</a> into use as 
freighters.  Using mole miners stolen from Nkllon, as well as a cloaking 
device, nearly forty capital ships were taken by the Empire.  Only last 
second heroics by Rouge Squadron and the Millenium Falcon kept the 
valuable ships from falling into Imperial hands.<P>

Here, you will take on the role as Rouge 2.  Defend the Fleet from the 
Imperial assult.  Remember, the safety of the Cruisers is your top 
priority, but you also need to keep the Sluis Van ship yards alive.  Good 
luck.<P>
