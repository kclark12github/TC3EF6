Tantoonie is a small, desert world that is in a binary star system.  Life
is tough there, with very few cities and even fewer spaceports.  Many
people are moisture farmers, trying to make a living drilling for water.
It was from this planet theat Luke Skywalke began his journey in the
events of Star Wars : A New Hope.  Obi-Wan Kenobi lived here as well, and
soon became a mentor for Luke, who was only 18 years old at the time.
The infamous ganster Jabba the Hutt made his palace on Tantoonie as well.

The only notible city on Tantoonie is Mos Eisley, and in the city is the
locayy famous Mos Eisley Cantina, a watering hole for the more
disreputable residents of the planet. </p>
