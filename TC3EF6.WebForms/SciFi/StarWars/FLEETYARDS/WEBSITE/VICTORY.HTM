<p> Thses older vessels were the first of the much feared Star Destroyer
line.  It had a larger superstructure and shield towers than an Imperial
class, and also is not as sleek or long.  However, the Victory I class has
the unique ability among the Star Destroyer family to be able to enter the
upper atmospheres of planets. In short, though obsolete, it is still a
strong ship to this day.

<p> Due to the flaws found in the Victory I class, Imperial scientists
came up with the Victory II. Designed purely for the space combat role, it
lacks the ground compliment of the I, but is faster than an Imperial Star
Destroyer, and has reinforce shield towers and armor.

<p> Length: 900 meters

<p>           50 NK-7 Ion Cannons
