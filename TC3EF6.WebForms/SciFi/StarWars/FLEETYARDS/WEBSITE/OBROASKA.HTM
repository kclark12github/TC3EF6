This was the first battle where we saw Grand Admiral Thrawn in action.  
Following a data dump from the Obroa-Skai database, a scout wing from the 
ISD Chimera headed back.  They were followed by four New Republic Assault 
Frigates and three squadrons of X-Wings.  Thrawn then executed a Marg 
Sabl, completely destroying the New Republic force.  <a

<P>
As you can see, the Republic Forces are in a miserable position, trapped 
between four separate Imperial forces.  Subsequently, they were utterly 
annihilated.  This was the beginning of Thrawn's campaign to restore the 
Empire, a campaign which came very close to succeeding...
