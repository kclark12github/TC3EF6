<H1>Mattel Issues a Recall For Toy Space Missiles</H1>

<B>ATLANTA</B>, Jan. 11, 1979 (UPI) -- A recall order, prompted by the death of one
child and injuries to 10 others, was issued today for the tiny toy
missiles that go with <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> space toys of the Mattel
Corporation. Two million of the toys were sold nationwide.<P>

A 4-year old boy from Lilburn, Ga., died Dec. 31 after swallowing one of
the projectiles, designed for firing from the space toys.<P>

The Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Mattel Corporation of
California issued the "missile mail-in" recall order and said it would
run until March 1. Mattel is offering another toy as an inducement to
have the missiles returned.<P>

The 1<SUP>1/4</SUP> inch red plastic missiles were made to fit several of the
space toys in the <I>Galactica</I> group, but a mission spokesman said in
Washington that the death and injuries appeared associated with only the
Colonial Viper toy. The spokesman said the barrel shape of the toy
seemed to invite children to put it in their mouths.<P>

<H1>Toy Recalled: But Calgarians Liked It</H1>

by Bob Beal (Herald staff writer)<BR>
[from <I>The Calgary Herald</I>, January 15, 1979]<P>

A toy blamed for the death of one American child and the injury of
several others is being recalled, although it was so popular during the
Christmas season it has virtually disappeared from Calgary stores.<P>

Lindsey Williams, Canadian president of Mattel Inc., said the decision
was made Thursday to recall four of the company's <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>
spaceship series that fire small red missiles.<P>

Mattel will replace the toys -- 120,000 of which have been sold in
Canada -- on retail shelves with modified models that don't fire
missiles, Williams said.<P>

He said consumers who send the company sets of the three-centimetre long
plastic missiles will receive a Mattel "Hot Wheels" matchbox-type toy
vehicle "to make up for the loss of play value in the original toys"
when the missiles are removed.<P>

The plastic space vehicles affected by the recall, which sell in retail
stores for about $8 and $11 [Canadian], are Colonial Viper, Colonial
Scarab, Colonial Stellar Probe, and Cylon Raider.<P>

The three-year-old Atlanta, Georgia child who died had fired a missile
into his mouth and swallowed it.<P>

Williams emphasized the missile "in itself complies with all the safety
regulations" of both the US and Canadian governments.<P>

Ed Reczek, southern Alberta product safety inspector for the federal
consumer affairs department said this is not so much a case of an unsafe
toy as it is of a toy being used unsafely.<P>

"I don't think the toy was made for small children. It's a case of
little brother getting hold of it," Reczek said.<P>

The toys "comply with our (hazardous products) act. So we're not
involved" in the recall. It is abuse that makes the missiles dangerous,
he said.<P>

The 16 to 24-centimetre long spaceships are "not recommended for
children under three" and fire their missiles at a relatively low
velocity over a short distance.<P>

In early December, Mattel began putting caution stickers on the toys
warning "do not put or fire red missiles into mouth or towards face."<P>

The company reviewed the toy again when the Atlanta child died Dec. 31.<P>

Williams said it is unfortunate the company has had to modify the toy
because "one of the fun, play features was that it did fire these little
missiles."<P>

<H1>Safety Rules Urged For Missiles In Toys</H1>

<B>Group Opposing Abuses in TV Ads for Children Finds Numerous Injuries
From Projectiles</B><P>

by Ernest Holsendolph, Special to <I>The New York Times</I><P>

<B>WASHINGTON</B>, Feb. 27, 1979 -- Action for Children's Television, which has long
been associated with opposition to abuses in advertising aimed at
children, asked the Government today to regulate toys that fire
missiles, including the popular space toys of last Christmas.<P>

Peggy Charren, president of the group, told reporters at a news
conference here that more than 1,000 youngsters were injured by
projectile-firing toys last year, and one child in Atlanta was reported
to have died after swallowing a missile fired into his throat.<P>

One of the most popular brands of such toys is Mattel's <I>Battlestar
Galactica</I> line, which the company asked to be taken off retail shelves
in January. However, Mrs. Charren said today that those toys could be
purchased in retail stores in Boston as recently as last Friday.<P>

A spokesman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which has been
coopering in the recall of the <I>Galactica</I> toys, said the agency was
exploring ways of getting additional messages to retailers to halt their
sale.<P>

In its petition to the product safety agency, Action for Children's
Television asked for new regulations to govern the safety in design of
missiles fired by toys and the force of the spring action that propels
them. It also called for labelling of projectile toys as being suitable
only for children eight years of age or older, and written instructions
that explain the presence of missiles in toys and ways to use them
safely.<P>

In another move, the television group, which was organized a decade ago
by parents in a Boston suburb, showed a film purporting to show the
damaging effects of television commercialism on the young.<P>

Called "Kids for Sale," the film was released six days before the
Federal Trade Commission opens a monthlong series of hearings on
proposals to limit, if not ban altogether, television advertising aimed
at children.<P>

In Los Angeles, Spencer Boise, vice president for corporate affairs at
Mattel Inc., defended the actions of the company's toy-making subsidiary
in the handling of the space toys<P>

<B>Will Exchange Toys</B><P>

"We have been in touch with the distributors by phone, Mailgram and by
letters," he said by telephone, "to let them know that we propose to
exchange the toys still on hand for a new, safer version, and meanwhile
they may substitute a Hot Wheels toy for the <I>Galactica toys</I>."<P>

Individual customers may not make such exchanges, he said, but they may
exchange the missiles for other toys.<P>

The new version of the space toys will fire missiles that remain
attached to the launchers, Mr. Boise said. Now coming off production
lines, they are just beginning to appear on retail shelves, he said.<P>

In addition to the <I>Galactica</I> series, according to Mrs. Charren, her
organization also feels that Mattel's Shogun Warrior and Mego Toys
Micronauts, which are still on sale, pose comparable dangers. She said
that nails could be fired from the toys "without making any changes in
the way the toys ordinarily work."<P>

She said that existing safety rules enforced by the Consumer Product
Safety Commission prohibited projectile toys for children under the age
of three, but she asserted that such toys were still dangerous for older
children.<P>

<H1>Toymaker Sued in Child's Death</H1>

<B>ATLANTA</B>, March 23, 1979 (AP) -- The parents of a 4-year old boy who died when
a toy missile lodged in his throat filed suits today seeking $14 million
from Mattel Inc., the manufacturer of the toy. The parents are John D.
Warren and his wife, Doris Warren, of Gwinnet County near Atlanta. Their
son, Robert Jeffery, died last Dec. 31.<P>
