<CITE>[ Battlestar Galactica review in <I>Time Magazine</I> (September 18, 1978) ]</CITE>

<H1>Small Screen Star Wars</H1>

<H2>Battlestar Galactica seems strangely familiar</H2>

by Bob Rich<P>

What much-ballyhooed show has the following elements: 1) a wise old man
whose mission is to save the human race; 2) an unusually nasty villain
who wants to destroy the human race; 3) two handsome young bucks who
trade good-humored gibes; 4) the most huggable little robot in the
universe; 5) a bizarre bar-room populated by inhuman creatures on a
desert planet; 6) lots of gray spaceships whishing around against a
brilliant blue background?<P>

The answer, as anyone knows who has been watching TV promotion spots
lately, is ABC's new series <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>, perhaps the most
blatant rip-off ever to appear on the small screen. The show ripped off,
naturally, is <I>Star Wars</I>, which <I>Galactica</I> copies in nearly everything
but wit and talent. As a result, even before the show premieres this
Sunday, it has been caught up in legal controversy.<P>

The plot differs from <I>Star Wars</I> only in detail: by some devilish
mischief, a race of robots has zapped twelve of the 13 planets harboring
the human race. Led by a human renegade called Count Baltar, a first
cousin to Darth Vader, the robots take off in hot pursuit of the
survivors of the dozen planets, who are manning a ragtag fleet hovering
around the "battlestar" <I>Galactica</I>. The humans are desperately
searching for the 13th planet, a lost, legendary human colony called
Earth. Lorne Greene is the wise old man in charge, and Dirk Benedict and
Richard Hatch play Han Solo and Luke Skywalker... oops. Lieut. Starbuck
and Captain Apollo. <I>Galactica</I>'s version of Artoo Detoo is a robot dog,
a "daggit," named Muffit. Unfortunately, the duplicator at Universal
Studios, which is producing the show, seems to have broken down before
it could re-create the inimitable Threepio or <I>Star Wars</I> '  Wookie, the
most famous Teddy bear since Winnie-the-Pooh.<P>

Universal has spent more money on <I>Galactica</I>, or <I>Star Wars 1<SUP>1/2</SUP></I>, as
it might be called, than anyone has ever spent on a TV series before -
$15 million, nearly double the cost of <I>Star Wars</I> itself. Moreover,
Tektronix, Inc., a computer firm, has contributed a real computerized
control room, and John Dykstra, 31, who created the wizardly special
effects for <I>Star Wars</I>, was commissioned to work the same magic for
<I>Galactica</I>.<P>

<I>Star Wars</I> fans will recognize his touch in some fierce space battle
scenes and seemingly three-dimensional images of stars and planets.
Similar tricks were also used to move the various robots. Whereas Artoo
Detoo was powered by a midget, <I>Galactica</I>'s Muffit hides a chimpanzee,
which Dykstra figured could more easily reproduce the unpredictable,
jumpy actions of another animal, or robot animal. The formidable
Lucifer, Count Baltar's aptly named robot assistant, however, does house
a man. Since Actor Bobby Porter is only 4 ft. 11 in., the towering
Lucifer has 18 unoccupied inches on top for a plastic head and enough
flashing lights to start his own discoth&egrave;que.<P>

Dykstra claims that he was not given the time or the authority to go
much beyond what he did in <I>Star Wars</I>, and he has already withdrawn
from full-time participation in the series. "I burned out doing that
show," he says. "I got tired of trying to do complicated things in that
environment [at Universal]." TV executives, he says, are accustomed to
changing a script several times a week. Actors can learn new lines every
day, but Dykstra's special effects are not so adaptable. Says he:
"Things couldn't be changed easily. It might take me two weeks to shoot
a particular scene." Dykstra is also resentful of comparisons to <I>Star
Wars</I>. "We didn't want to do a rip-off," he complains, "we wanted to do
a genre picture."<P>

20th Century-Fox, which produced <I>Star Wars</I>, feels ripped off
nonetheless and is suing Universal for infringement of copyright and
unfair competition. Says Fox Vice President Joseph Gallagher: "We are
convinced that Universal doesn't have a right to produce this show."
Universal huffily replies that <I>Star Wars</I> is a shameless imitation of
Universal's own 1972 film <I>Silent Running</I>, directed by Douglas
Trumbull, and is countersuing. <I>Galactica</I> Producer Glen Larson, who has
made a profitable career out of turning other people's movie plots,
including <I>Coogan's Bluff</I> and <I>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</I>,
into his own TV shows (<I>McCloud</I> and <I>Alias Smith and Jones</I>), mildly
dismisses the notion that his new show was inspired by <I>Star Wars</I>."I
think our story is very fresh," he asserts, "and we've made our own
breakthroughs."<P>

It may all end in court, but in the meantime viewers will probably be
able to see at least the first year's run of <I>Galactica</I> and have a
chance to make up their own minds. Universal's toughest jury, in fact,
may be those several hundred families that decide the Nielsen ratings.
Science fiction has never been very popular on prime-time television,
particularly among women viewers, and <I>Galactica</I> will face that
long-term prejudice.<P>

Viewer curiosity and ABC's continual promotion will probably bring in
high ratings initially, but the show will need something more than
special effects -- namely believable plots and characters -- in order to
survive what promises to be television's most competitive year.<P>
