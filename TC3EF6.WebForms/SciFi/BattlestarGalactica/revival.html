This document contains information that has been posted or published
regarding the long rumored revival of <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>. It is now
at the stage where one television network had an interest in the project
(Fox), and scripts have been written. There was also a proposal for an
animated series.<P>

On the licensing front, Galactica has already made a comeback. In August
1995, Rob Liefeld's Maximum Press released a <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> line
of comic books, featuring all new stories, including one scripted by
Richard Hatch. Trendmaster toys is set to release a new series of
<I>Galactica</I> toys in 1997. Dart Carts is set to release a 72 trading card
set in late 1996.<P>

<HR><H2>Timeline:</H2>

<DL><DT><B>May, 1978</B>
   <DD>Universal shows ABC the theatrical version of the <I>Battlestar
   Galactica</I> pilot. After viewing the first half hour, ABC upgrades the
   project from three proposed telemovies (the three hour pilot, and the
   first two-hour episodes,) into a weekly series.<P>

<DT><B>July 7, 1978</B>
   <DD>Two-hour theatrical version of BSG pilot begins a healthy run in
   Canadian and European theaters.<P>

<DT><B>September 17, 1978</B>
   <DD>Three-hour BSG pilot premieres on ABC television, with some 20
   additional minutes of footage absent from the Canadian version.<P>

<DT><B>April 29, 1979</B>
   <DD>BSG's last original episode, "The Hand of God" appears. That month
   ABC confirmed that <I>Galactica</I> would not return in the fall season.<P>

<DT><B>May 18, 1979</B>
   <DD>BSG pilot appears as a two-hour movie in US theaters. An interview
   with Glen Larson in <I>The New York Times</I> (May 13) confirms that ABC
   has asked him for a two-hour movie in which the <I>Galactica</I> discovers
   Earth. At one point Isaac Asimov was associated with the project.
   Asimov had previously agreed to work on the second-season story bible
   weeks just prior to BSG's cancelation.

   <I>New York Times</I> (May 13, 1979)<P>

<DT><B>August 7, 1979</B>
   <DD>ABC stops airing BSG reruns. By the end of the season, <I>Battlestar
   Galactica</I> had finished 18th from among 100+ contenders. Not bad for
   a show canceled in mid-season.<P>

<DT><B>January 27, 1980</B>
   <DD><I>Galactica 1980</I> three-hour pilot appears on ABC, expanded from the
   original two hours. No Asimov. None of the original cast except for
   Adama and Boomer. Troy and Dillon (attempt to) replace Apollo and
   Starbuck. Originally intended for the Fall 1980 season, ABC aired the
   show as mid-season replacement just weeks after the completion of the
   pilot episode.

   Television Awards</I>, winning best series, best actor (Dirk Benedict
   and best actress (Laurette Spang.)

<DT><B>May 4, 1980</B>

   disappears from television.<P>

<DT><B>June 27, 1985</B>
   <DD><I>Colonial Con I</I> in Easton, Maryland: Richard ("Apollo") Hatch and
   Robert Thurston (writer of several adaptations for Berkely) appear.
   Thurston announces four original stories (#11-#14) are to be written.
   No news on any television revival.

   Chameleon, in "The Man with Nine Lives."<P>

<DT><B>September 11, 1987</B>
   <DD>Lorne Greene (b. 1915), dies. Greene played Commander Adama in BSG
   and Ben Cartwright in <I>Bonanza</I>.<P>

<DT><B>October 15, 1989</B>
   <DD>"Glen Larson has some twenty additional [BSG] scripts that were in
   various states of completion when the axe came on the 2nd season.
   Everyone was fully convinced that the show would be renewed, and that
   it would run a bit smoother. We've seen two of them in novel form,
   and the others <I>would</I> have been released had sales on the last one
   ('Apollo's War') not been so bad. Larson still wants to revive the
   show, but without Lorne Greene."

<DT><B>June 23, 1991</B>
   <DD>"There has been a rumor going around about a new <I>Battlestar
   Galactica</I> screenplay being considered by a Japanese production
   company who is buying copyrights from Universal Studios. The
   storyline concerns the Cylons finding Earth! including surviving cast
   members in their original roles. It is unknown if Glen Larson is
   involved or not. Contact:

<DT><B>September 15, 1992</B>
   <DD>"Dirk Benedict and Richard Hatch will be on Vicki Lawrence's show
   next week, (the 24?, I think) Hatch is trying to get people excited
   about a BSG movie, (which would totally ignore <I>Galactica 1980</I>), but
   Dirk is a lot less interested. Hatch is also considering a BSG 15th
   year anniversary con, probably in Seattle, (and again, Dirk is a lot
   less interested...)"
   <DD>--Sandra Hereld (<TT>rhiann@milton.u.washington.edu</TT>)<P>

<DT><B>November, 1992</B>
   <DD>The US cable network <I>The Sci-Fi Channel</I> officially goes on the air.
   Both BSG and <I>Buck Rogers</I> become part of its daily prime time
   lineup.<P>

<DT><B>April 2, 1993</B>
   <DD>"Apparently due to the popularity of ST:TNG and the release of new SF
   shows like <I>Deep Space Nine</I> and <I>Babylon 5</I>, Universal Studios is
   seriously considering producing a <I>new</I> series of BSG with Members of
   the <I>original</I> cast. Both Richard Hatch and Dirk Benedict have
   expressed an interest, and the project is currently at the planning
   stage. An international campaign is currently under way to persuade
   Universal that <I>they really want to do this</I>. Please help by writing
   <I>now</I> to anyone who may have an influence; your local or national TV
   company, <I>Sky</I>, other satellite and cable companies; in the US, <I>The
   Sci-Fi Channel</I>, but most importantly please write (separately) to
   the following two people:
      <DL><DD>Mr. Thomas Thayer | Ms. Barbara Fisher
      <DD>100 Universal City Plaza
      <DD>Universal City CA, 91608
      <DD>USA</DL>
   <DD>(Mr. Thayer heads Universal Studio's Syndication division, while Ms.
   Fisher heads the cable division.)<P>

   <DD>Please write a short, polite letter explaining that you've heard that
   there may be a new <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> project in the pipeline and
   how you'd love to see BSG back on the air with original cast members.
   Please make it look like an independent letter, and not one that just
   a standard letter obviously from an international campaign. For
   further info contact the unofficial BSG UK fan club, <I>The Thirteenth
   Tribe</I>."

<DT><B>October 15-17, 1993</B>
   <DD><I>Battlestar Galactica 15 Yahren Reunion</I> in L.A.: Glen Larson, on
   Oct. 16, said: "In the past few weeks a few interesting things have
   happened. Without getting too specific, the Fox television network
   would like to bring <I>Galactica</I> back... There is a good chance we
   will be doing... something like a four-hour movie that will
   re-examine the whole saga of <I>Galactica</I> and its past, present,
   future. And that would be pretty fun I think for most of us because
   it would give us a chance to realize the end game, some of the things
   that were set up and that we would have liked to have had a chance to
   explore..." The prime mover behind both the convention and
   <I>Galactica</I>'s revival is Richard Hatch, who did not want to give
   anything away in the script that had been written (Hatch had also
   been interviewed in <I>Starlog</I> that month regarding BSG.) Most of the
   surviving cast members were more than willing to participate in a BSG
   revival. Don Bellisario (BSG, <I>Magnum PI</I>, <I>Quantum Leap</I>, <I>Jag</I>)
   would probably not be involved, and is now at Paramount Studios.<P>

<DT><B>April 17, 1994</B>
   <DD>"I was watching a show on our E! entertainment network and Richard
   Hatch was the guest. The show was <I>Talk Soap</I>. Richard was taking
   phone calls mostly for his soap opera characters. But one person
   called about 'any future plans for a reunion.' Richard responded
   telling him about the convention and saying that he didn't want to
   give up any 'inside information' but he has written a <I>trilogy</I> of
   new <I>Galactica</I> movies, and Fox may do something with them."
   <DD>--Tom Norman (<TT>wcnorman@music.loyno.edu</TT>)<P>

<DT><B>Late April 1994</B>
   <DD><I>Hero Science Fiction Annual</I>: The proposed revival of <I>Battlestar
   Galactica</I> is being kept "hush hush," with a surprising creative crew
   (not specified) behind the project.<P>

<DT><B>Late April 1994</B>
   <DD><I>Wizard #34</I>: Image Comics co-founder Rob Liefeld acquires the
   licence to do <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> comics, to be published under
   the Maximum Press imprint.<P>

<DT><B>June 14, 1994</B>
   <DD>"I just got off the phone with Dee Jay Driscoll, who organized the
   <I>Galactica 15 Yahren Reunion</I>... I asked if there was any further
   news about a new movie/series, and was told that Fox (who had been
   interested) recently told Glen Larson that they were now a little
   wary about doing it, as the convention had such a low turnout.<P>

   <DD>"The con had been extensively advertised in <I>Starlog</I>, on <I>The Sci-Fi
   Channel</I>, and in many other places as well. Unfortunately, the Hilton
   (host of the con) had actually been telling people that there was <I>no
   convention</I>, that it had been canceled, and had been turning away
   fans <I>and guests</I> at the door and on the telephone... Apparently,
   there was some awards ceremony going on at the hotel, and middle
   management didn't want a bunch of skiffy fans around making things
   look bad.<P>

   <DD>"Since the Hilton may very well have killed the plans for a new
   <I>Galactica</I> series, in order to avoid a lawsuit from Glen Larson,
   they have agreed to host <I>another</I> convention for free (not free for
   <I>us</I> to get in, just free rent to the con people) -- This one will be
   on October 27-29, 1995, and both Universal and <I>The Sci-Fi Channel</I>
   will be involved. Many of the same guests (and more) will be in
   attendance, and it will 'have more than just <I>Galactica</I>' (i.e.,
   Galacticon plus a 'mainstream sci-fi con' (is that an
   oxymoron?))"

<DT><B>November 4, 1994</B>
   <DD>"Fox television has recently let it known that it wants input on
   their shows on the Net, in particular, the <I>Alien Nation</I> revival,
   and <I>The X-Files</I>. There has never been a better time for <I>Galactica</I>
   fans. People who want a revival with the surviving original cast of
   the series, and who have waited 15 years for it! Fox has shown a
   willingness to revive once-dead properties in the form of the recent
   <I>Alien Nation</I> two-hour movie, and may make more, if given enough
   positive response. If people show enough interest, Fox could easily
   regain interest in <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>. So help bring <I>Galactica</I>
   back! Send your letters of support to <A HREF=
   "mailto:foxnet@delfphi.com"<TT>foxnet@delphi.com</TT></A>.<P>

   <DD>"Take the time to write a letter explaining your interest in
   <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> and your support for a revival of the show.
   And make sure that you put '<I>Galactica</I>' or '<I>Battlestar Galactica</I>'
   in the <TT>Subject:</TT> field of the letter.

<DT><B>March 11-12, 1995</B>
   <DD>John Colicos appears at Vulkon 95 in Baltimore, Maryland: "I know
   y'all want comments about John Colicos's Q&A session, so I'll do my
   best... I was surprised to hear that someone high up in the
   organization is considering a BSG animated series. He has been asked
   to do the voice of Baltar, of course, but said he would have to see a
   script or two before he makes any commitments to the show. <I>If</I> it
   gets off the ground. Well, if he does do the voice, from what he said
   earlier, I know it's a good show. He has turned down parts because he
   didn't like the way the scripts were written...<P>

   <DD>"He also doesn't think much of a Galactican revival; the parties
   involved are too scattered; Terry Carter is travelling all over,
   directing/producing whatever, I think he mentioned Laurette being
   back in Detroit; he just didn't think it would work. I suppose if
   Larson (or whoever) approached him about the idea, he'd give him his
   thoughts aboout the matter. Not really sure if he'd be willing to
   come back to the part, though. I was never able to infer such info
   from listening to him."

   <DD><I>Starlog #205</I> publishes an apology from Juan Aquinde, general
   manager of the Universal Hilton & Towers, for his hotel's role in the
   low turnout at the <I>15 Yahren Reunion</I>, along with an advertisement
   for <I>Con Rad</I>, a general science fiction convention to be held
   October 27-29 at the same hotel. <I>Con Rad</I>'s <I>Pre-Con Report #2</I>
   indicates that the following <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> actors and
   creators will be confirmed guests: Richard Hatch (Apollo), Dirk
   Benedict (Starbuck), Anne Lockhart (Sheba), Glen Larson (Executive
   Producer), Stu Phillips (Composer), Terry McDonnell and Jim Carlson
   (Story Editors.) These guests also appeared at the <I>15 Yahren
   Reunion</I> in October 1993.<P>

<DT><B>August 1995</B>
   <DD>Rob Liefeld's Maximum Press releases the premiere issue of
   <I>Battlestar Galactica: War of Eden #1</I>, the first of several proposed
   limited series from the same publisher. This issue marks the first
   appearance BSG in comic book format since the Marvel Comics published
   <I>Battlestar Galactica #23</I> in January 1981.<P>

<DT><B>September 20 1995</B>
   <DD><B>PRESS RELEASE: RICHARD HATCH TO WRITE BATTLESTAR GALACTICA COMIC</B>
   <DD><I>Battlestar Galactica</I>'s Richard Hatch, who portrayed the popular
   character Apollo in the television series and motion picture, returns
   to the "rag tag fugitive fleet" after 15 years to write the next
   mini-series for Maximum Press. "We are absolutely thrilled to be
   working with Richard Hatch in this capacity," says Extreme President
   and owner Rob Liefeld. "His involvement with the original show gives
   him unique insights into the characters and adds a whole new
   dimension to what we're trying to do with the series. Several other
   science-fiction actors have written small premises for comic book
   stories, but Hatch really wants to get involved with the writing and
   promotion behind this book."
