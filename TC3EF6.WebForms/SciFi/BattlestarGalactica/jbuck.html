<H1>Galactica Enters Space Derby: Biblical Or Space Western, It's Way Out</H1>

by Jerry Buck<P>

<B>LOS ANGELES</B>, Sep. 17, 1978 -- When <I>Star Wars</I> came out a year ago and
made movie box-office history, it was praised not only as a space epic
but also for its kinship to westerns and swashbucklers.<P>

Much the same thing is happening with ABC's new Sunday night series,
<I>Battlestar Galactica</I>.<P>

Its creator, Glen Larson, calls it "biblical" and compares it to <I>Wagon
Train</I>." Lorne Greene likens the widowed father figure he plays as
Commander Adama to his role as Ben Cartwright in <I>Bonanza</I>.<P>

<I>Galactica</I>, which follows a group of space immigrants seeking Earth
after devastation of their own planets, premiers tonight with a
three-hour movie. It also stars Richard Hatch and Dirk Benedict. The
show will, if nothing else, set a record as the most expensive regular
series ever made.<P>

The movie cost $7 million, although the cost of the sets and costumes
can be spread over the tenure of the series. Some individual episodes
are costing $1 million, twice the present rate for a one-hour series.
Universal Studios is already recovering its investment. The movie,
edited to two hours, pulled in $4 million in the first eight weeks of
theatrical release in Canada, and will debut in Europe in October.<P>

"<I>Galactica</I> has a biblical feel,' Larson says. "It ties in with
Genesis, it ties in with the western pioneers. That's why we can do
people stories even though we're in space. That's why we have Lorne
Greene. It's like <I>Wagon Train</I>. It's <I>Exodus</I>, it's <I>The Fugitive</I>.
It's people on the run. It doesn't matter where they're going, it's what
happens on the way.<P>

"The gimmick the network liked was that they are searching for Earth. So
much science fiction is the opposite -- people leaving a devastated
Earth searching for other homes."<P>

Greene, his hair silver, attired in the dark, purplish uniform and cape
of his character, says: "These people could be our ancestors. They are
searching for Earth. But it's up to the audience to decide the time
frame -- whether it's the past, present or future."<P>

Larson is counting on the space craze generated by <I>Star Wars</I> and <I>Star
Trek</I> reruns. But <I>Galactica</I> also seeks to capitalize on the public
fascination stirred by <I>Chariots of the Gods</I> and other works
speculating that Earth was visited by astronauts far in antiquity.<P>

Therein Larson has planted the biblical seed, linking it symbolically to
Genesis and the 13 tribes of Israel -- one of which was lost.<P>

In the story, Kobol was the mother planet -- the Garden of Eden? --
which sent out space proves and found 13 planets capable of supporting
life.<P>

It colonized 12 of those planets, but when these civilizations are
destroyed by the Cylons in a thousand-year war, the survivors set out in
any spacecraft that will fly in a vast migration for the 13th planet:
Earth.<P>

<I>Galactica</I> is the story of that migration, and in their flight they are
harassed by the Cylons. The Cylons are computerized robots who make
themselves and mend themselves. Their world is completely void of
anything biological.<P>

"It's interesting that in the series the computer should be our enemy,"
says Greene. "Because the computer could become our enemy here on Earth.
We have no secrets from them. There is a certain symbolism in that which
is very pertinent."<P>

The major factor in the high cost of the series is the special effects.
But Larson has also taken the extraordinary step of sending a
second-unit crew to film the Egyptian ruins at Luxor. It will be used to
represent the dead planet of Kobol. Costumed stand-ins will represent
the stars in Egypt. The costumes in the series have a faint Egyptian
flavor, particularly in the decorative jewelry. Film from Luxor will
also be used for front-screen projection, which is more realistic than
rear-screen projection and gives a feeling that the actors are actually
there.<P>

The set for the bridge of the <I>Starship Galactica</I> is lined with
computers -- all real and all working. There are television screens at
each post and each one is hooked up to a video tape recorder so that
pictures appear on them.<P>

20th Century-Fox, which released <I>Star Wars</I>, has sued Universal to
block <I>Galactica</I>. Fox, charging copyright infringement, is seeking --
unsuccessfully so far -- an injunction to keep the show off the air.<P>

MCA Inc., the parent company of Universal, filed two countersuits, one
of which alleges that Fox copied <I>Star Wars</I> from its 1972 movie <I>Silent
Running</I>.<P>

There is a superficial resemblance to <I>Star Wars</I>. The Cylons are
silvery, with metallic faces and a heavy breathing sound not unlike
Darth Vader. But the greatest resemblance is in the special effects of
the zooming spaceships and explosions.<P>

John Dykstra was special-effects coordinator for both <I>Star Wars</I> and
<I>Galactica</I>. He's also producer of the series. But Dykstra -- with Doug
Trumbull (<I>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</I>) -- worked on Universal's
"Silent Running" and it was there they developed the technology for
exploding ships and making robots. Trumbull is now coordinating the
special effects for another Larson space show for NBC, <I>Buck Rogers</I>.<P>

Of the Fox suit, Larson says, "They put us into business. They rented us
the facility for the special effects. Now we have our own facility. I
don't see how anyone can say we're copying <I>Star Wars</I> unless you say
the first man to produce a horse opera had a lock on the westerns from
then on."<P>
