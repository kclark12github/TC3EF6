Chris Scalf has been doing some very impressive Battlestar Galactica comic book art. He's been doing some work for Maximum Press, for their <A HREF=comic.html>BG comic series.</A><p>

<h2>Classic Galactica</h2>
Chris recently started work on a new Galactica story. He has sent samples to Maximum Press, but they haven't seemed interested. He'd like to get his work out to the public, though, so I'm providing his story on these pages.<p>

There are nine pages done so far, with more to come. If you'd like to see how the story ends, you can read the <A HREF=summary.html>plot summary</A> or just wait for the rest of the pages.</A>

Each of these thumbnails links in with a page. You can start at the beginning and step your way through, or pick up in the middle. Each page is a JPEG file, about 100K each. The images here are about 10% smaller than Chris's originals.<p>

<h2>Apollo's Quest</h2>
I've been sent a collection of images which is supposed to be the conclusion of "Apollo's Quest" (not the story begun above).  I've tried to put them into some kind of logical order, but it's just guesswork, especially since the pages arrived without any dialogue.  If you figure it out, let me know.  These images were scanned and touched up (some of the originals were damaged) by Aaron Coleman.<p>

<hr>

The old page of Chris' art is temporarily available <A HREF=index21.html>here.</A> I have more of his work still to scan, at which point I'll reorganize a bit.<p>

Chris is very interested in hearing people's response to his work. You can send your comments to me (<A HREF=mailto:mheiman@carleton.edu>mheiman@carleton.edu</A>) or you can phone/FAX him at (810) 685-0335.
