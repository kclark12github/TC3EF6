<h1>Battlestar Galactica 1-4</h1>
<h2>Maximum Press</h2>
a review by David Dorton (<A HREF=mailto:dortodd@mail.auburn.edu>dortodd@mail.auburn.edu</A>) <p>

One characteristic that fans of different science fiction shows seem to share is the desire for more. Over the years, licensees who saw profit possibilities have been more than happy to fulfill this desire. As a result, endless novels, comics and computer games based on television and movies have appeared. For the most part, comic adaptations of science fiction have been poorly done. The Marvel Comics version of Battlestar Galactica from the time of the show is no exception. It failed to capture the spirit of the show or the characters, or to even be a particularly good comic in it's own right. In contrast, the new Battlestar Galactica comic from Maximum Press is more impressive than most adaptations of existing work. The art is very good, with a mythological feel. The story lines are competent, and are paced at an acceptable level. It is, in short, a good comic book. However, since it is an adaptation/continuation of an existing TV show, it also must shoulder the burden of being a good "episode" of Battlestar Galactica to be a true success.<p>

The best thing about the comic is that it seems to be written by true fans of the series. Rob Liefeld, and the others involved in the comic, have included a wealth of information about the series and are obviously trying to be true to BG, while still creating a distinctive story of their own. Instead of an ongoing series, the title is beginning as a series of mini-series, each of which is a complete story. The first story arc takes place 20 yarhens after the last episode of Battlestar Galactica and ignores (as it should) the horrible Galactica 1980 series. Much is as the fan would expect for the future of our rag tag fugitive fleet. Apollo is Commander, holding the responsibilities that once belonged to Adama. Starbuck is still a pilot, and is joined by Lt. Box (known to us as Boxey). Apollo and Sheba are sealed and have a son named Cain, after Sheba's legendary father. Tigh is the president of the council of the twelve. Baltar seems to have escaped his exile and once again is chasing the Galactica with Cylon forces at this command.<p>

The story line, while not what I expected, also is arguably faithful to the series, relying heavily on several episodes. The basicstory reveals that the Galactica has used the coordinates given them by the white lights (who thwarted Count Iblis and resurrectedApollo on the show) to find Earth. The Galactica arrived at Earth with the help of a faster than light technology given them by the white lights, named Seraphs in the comic. But it isn't any Earth a fan would have expected. It is a world overgrown by vegetation, a world where dinosaurs roam freely. And it is a world with a huge pyramid that the Galacticans must investigate. Since the planet is believed to be Earth, it's investigation involves the inclusion of someone very important to Commander Apollo, someone whose health is very precarious. The Cylons are nearby, of course. They, too have had help finding Earth and help with warp technology, courtesy of Count Iblis (again from the TV show). <p>

The story is good, and contains more than a few twists and turns. But that still doesn't mean it is good Battlestar Galactica. I definitely have mixed feelings about it. Some is just as it should be, but much is different. Maximum Press didn't have permission to use the likeness of the actors so everyone looks different. Sheba is now a beautiful blond. Baltar has mechanical arms. Starbuck has long flowing hair and Iblis is a bald guy with pointy ears. While the look is very distinctive, it doesn't seem much like Battlestar Galactica. Additionally, they changed some things that presumably could have been left the same. All of the ships are different now. Vipers have gun additions on the wing (somewhat illogical considering the tight launch tubes), and Cylons look different (both the ships and the centurions). It's also a little hard to get the feel of the characters to gauge if they have similar enough personalities to the characters on the show. <p>

There are also some parts of the story line that I simply disagree with (some of which are admittedly nitpicky.) Iblis indicates that he and Sheba had a "tryst" in the original series. While the show certainly hinted at the possibility, it did not establish it; given Sheba's seeming innocence and Iblis' possibly demonic nature I think it would have been better to leave it open to interpretation. I'm also not so sure how the whole idea of an Earth that presumably is Earth of the distant future, or distant past (which the editors have hinted isn't the case), works regarding the transmission of the moon landing from the last TV episode. Personally, I even question the extremely heavy reliance on the Seraphs and Count Iblis for the story line. I suppose I am in a minority of the fans in not favoring that aspect of the original series, but I never did care for it. <p>

Ultimately, I have not yet accepted the comic as the "canon" future events of the fleet. It is a good effort, obviously crafted bytrue fans of the show, and I can understand those who have embraced it. I do plan to read it for a while and see how things develop but as of now I would feel no sense of loss if revival plans for the TV show were finally successful and the Maximum Press continuity was hopelessly contradicted by a movie or mini-series. If you are a fan of both BG and comics I would recommend giving the book a try. You may very well reject it, but it is interesting to see what Maximum Press is doing with the concept, and it is nice to finally see somebody doing something with BG for a change. The first story arc is complete and back issues of the book are not easy to come by. However, a trade paperback of the 4 issue first story will be released and this may be the way to go...I think the first story provides enough material to make a decision as to whether you want more of the book or not. The present and future includes the second story arc, "The Enemy Within". Also promised is a mini-series set during the TV show, focusing on Starbuck.
