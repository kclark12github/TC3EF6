The Mac Galactica Pack consists of 4 StartupScreens & matching background pictures (2 640x480 & 2 832x624), 15 icons, and 47 sounds (2.5 megs!).  System 7 or higher is required for best use, and other software will be needed to use the background pictures (Decor or MacUser magazine's BackSplash II [available at <A HREF=http://www.zdnet.com/macuser/>MacUser's site</A>]) and associate the sounds with any action beyond a standard "beep" or double clicking on the sound to play it (SoundMaster, Kaboom! [commercial product], or SndControl).  These utilities can be found wherever great shareware is found.  One location is the <A HREF=http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive/HyperArchive.html>INFO-MAC HyperArchive</A><p>

<h2>StartupScreens</h2>
To use the StartupScreens, move the desired StartupScreen file into the System Folder.  When you restart, the Welcome to Macintosh display will be replaced by the Battlestar Galactica picture during startup.  Unless you are using a background picture utility to display one of the corresponding Desktop Backgrounds you will see your normal desktop once startup is complete.<p>

Some versions of System 7.5 do not handle StartupScreens very well.  If you have this problem, update your system to System 7.5.3 with Apple's System 7.5 Update 2.0 (or higher when newer updates come out).<p>

<h2>Desktop Backgrounds</h2>
To use the pictures follow the instructions in the desktop background utility you are using.  My personal favorite is BackSplash II from MacUser magazine, although many people prefer Decor.<p>

<h2>Icons (System 7 or higher required)</h2>
To use the icons, click once on the icon you want to copy and choose Get Info from the File menu.  Click on the icon in the info window and choose Copy from the Edit menu.  Close the info window and find the file, folder, or disk you want to replace the icon of.  Click once on the icon you want to replace the icon of and choose Get Info from the File menu.  Click on the icon in the info window, choose Paste from the Edit menu, and you have a file (or folder or disk) with a Galactica icon!  If you get confused, turn on balloon help and point to the icon in the info window, or look under "icon" in the index of the manual that came with your Macintosh.<p>

If you are using System 7.5, your computer can walk you through and teach you how to use the icons.  All you need to do is go to the Guide menu in the Finder (the question mark) and choose Macintosh Guide.  Click on the Look For button and search on the word "icon".  In the list that appears on the right, look for "How do I change an icon's picture?"  Click on it, then click the OK button.<p>

<h2>Sounds (System 7 or higher required)</h2>
The sounds can be installed in the System file to be used as beeps by dragging them onto the closed System Folder and clicking OK when the Macintosh asks you if you want them in the System file.  You can then set the sound to be your beep sound with the Sound control panel.  Otherwise you can hear them by double clicking them in the Finder.<p>

To associate the sounds with various actions of your Macintosh, such as disk insert, shutdown, and  many others, follow the instructions in the sound playing utility you are using.  SoundMaster is widely available, with Kaboom! being the commercial version.  I've used SndControl (part of the Sound Manager Package), with Now Fun containing a commercial version of SndControl.<p>
