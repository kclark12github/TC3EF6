<H1>How many Battlestars are there?</H1>

Perhaps this is a question best left unanswered. Here is a transcript of
a dialogue recorded at the <I>Galactica 15 Yahren Reunion</I> on October
13-15 in Los Angeles, between Glen Larson, and an inquiring fan (dressed
in Commander Cain garb):

   <DL><DD><B>Fan:</B>     What were the names of the 12 Battlestars? We've seen
            different lists.
   <DD><B>Larson:</B>  They weren't Battlestars. They were the names of the
            planets.
   <DD><B>Fan:</B>     You have the <I>Galactica</I>, the <I>Pacifica</I>, the <I>Atlantia</I>,
            the <I>Pegasus</I>... the ship names.
   <DD><B>Larson:</B>  We never arrived that there were 12 Battlestars. We only
            actually shot the <I>Atlantia</I>, the <I>Pegasus</I>, the
            <I>Galactica</I>. I can't think of any others.
   <DD><B>Fan:</B>     During the attack by the Cylons on the fleet, you hear in
            the background, the <I>Pacifica</I>, the <I>Triton</I> is moving up
            alongside the <I>Acropolis</I>. You here these different names
            coming up. And we are tryng to decipher what they were.
   <DD><B>Larson:</B>  I appreciate the question and we have reason to want to look
            into that, and we'll have to research that.</DL>

<H1>The Sources of the Battlestar Names</H1>

There are five main sources used for the Battlestar names in this
document. The discussion of these sources also raises the question of
what is a reliable Battlestar name source, and what is the correct
spelling.<P>

<DL><DT>1.    <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> television episodes
   <DD>In the 24 hours of the <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> series, only five
   Battlestars are speficially mentioned. These are, in order of
   appearance: <I>Galactica</I>, <I>Atlantia</I>, <I>Columbia</I>, <I>Pegasus</I> and
   <I>Rycon</I>.<P>

<DT>2.    The <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> pocket books
   <DD>There were 14 pocket books published by Berkely between 1978 and
   1984. Two of them are sources for new Battlestar names. The
   <I>Pacifica</I> and <I>Solaria</I> are found in the pilot novelization
   <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> (Berkley, 1978) by Robert Thurston, and the
   <I>Battlestar Cerberus</I> in <I>BG 7: War of the Gods</I> (Berkley, 1982) by
   Nicolas Yermakov (aka Simon Hawke.)<P>

<DT>3.    <I>The Official Battlestar Galactica Scrapbook</I> (Grosset &amp; Dunlap,
1978) by James Neyland.
   <DD>On page 14, this publication asserts that there were five surviving
   Battlestars before the ambush at Cimtar, of which four were destroyed
   by Cylon forces. In addition to the <I>Galactica</I>, it names three of
   these four Battlestars, namely, the <I>Atlantia</I>, the <I>Pacifica</I>, and
   the <I>Solaria</I>. This publication mentions the <I>Pegasus</I>, which was
   presumed to be destroyed prior to Cimtar, only to reemerge in the
   two-part episode "The Living Legend".<P>

<DT>4.    <I>Encyclopedia Galactica: From The Fleet Library Abord The
Battlestar Galactica</I> (Windmill, 1979) by Bruce Krause
   <DD>Under the section "Battlestar", it is specifically stated that "only
   two of the twelve Battlestars are known to have survived the Final
   Destruction," namely the <I>Galactica</I> and the <I>Pegasus</I>. Elsewhere,
   under the biography of Colonel Tigh, it says that he previously
   served aboard the <I>Bellerephon</I> (note the spelling.)<P>

<DT>5.    <I>The Colonial Warriors Technical Manual</I> (Space Waste, 1988)
   <DD>One idea in fandom is that there was one Battlestar per colony.
   Outside of the fandom press, this is the first known pubished
   reference. This publication, however, is poorly researched and
   edited, and the authors freely made up definitions, flags, and time
   unit relationships. They provide a list of the 12 Battlestars, each
   paired with its own colony. <I>Bellerephon</I>, from EG, is rendered as
   <I>Bellephon</I>. No mention is made of the <I>Cerberus</I>, from the
   novelization, <I>War of the Gods</I>. Four new Battlestar names appear,
   including the<I>Argo</I>, the <I>Olympia</I>, the <I>Poseidon</I>, and the
   <I>Prometheus</I>.<P>

<DT>6     Larry Mager's Battlestars article in <I>Anomaly #15</I>, published by
Sue Paxton's <I>Anomaly</I>
   <DD>Larry Mager, a long time <I>Galactica</I> fan, produced an extremely well
   researched article on the Battlestar names in <I>Anomaly #15</I>. In
   addition to the series episodes, he relied on three other sources --
   background dialog in the pilot episode, a list given to Robert
   Thurston by the <I>Galactica</I> producers, and conversations with New
   West, from <I>Galactica</I>'s Costuming Department. In addition to all the
   Battlestar names from the first four sources, two of the four from
   the CWTM, are also present in his list. According to Mager,
   <I>Bellerophon</I>, and <I>Rycon</I> are the definite spellings of these names.
   The <I>Valiant</I> was used in a variant list in place of the <I>Olympia</I>.
   Apparently, several lists are out there, circulated by series creator
   Glen Larson.</DL>

The CWTM and the EG, continue to have an influence on <I>Galactica</I>
fandom. Recently the list was printed in one of the Maximum Press comic
books. The CWTM Battlestar list was utilized in all versions of the
<I>Battlestar Galactica Frequently Asked Questions</I> file prior to version
3.0. Subsequent versions have utilized Mager's list. Besides the
spelling of several names, both lists share 10 Battlestars in common. As
for the other two Battlestar names, where Mager's list has the
<I>Acropolis</I> and the <I>Cerberus</I>, the CWTM uses the <I>Argo</I> and the
<I>Poseidon</I>.<P>

There is the question of which Battlestars were present at Cimtar. In
the pilot episode, five Battlestars are visible were there. In Mager's
list, at least four Battlestars were present: <I>Galactica</I>, <I>Atlantia</I>,
<I>Acropolis</I>, and <I>Pacifica</I>. According to Centurion Vulpa in "Gun on Ice
Planet Zero - Part 1", the <I>Columbia</I> was destroyed at Cimtar. In the
pilot novelization and <I>The Battlestar Galactica Scrapbook</I>, the
<I>Solaria</I> was also destroyed.<P>

<H2>I. Battlestar Names from the Series</H2>

<H3>1. Galactica</H3>

Commander Adama's Battlestar. Present at Cimtar.

<H3>2. Atlantia</H3>

President Adar's Battlestar. Destroyed at Cimtar. First and last
appearance in the pilot episode.

<H3>3. Columbia</H3>

According to Centurion Vulpa, it was destroyed at Cimtar. Here is the
scene in "Gun on Ice Planet Zero - Part 1":

   <DL><DD><B>Vulpa:</B>      What are the coordinates of the <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>.
   <DD><B>Cree:</B> I'm from the <I>Columbia</I>.
   <DD><B>Vulpa:</B>      The <I>Columbia</I> was destroyed at the peace conference.
   <DD><B>Cree:</B> Peace conference?</DL>

<H3>4. Pegasus</H3>

Commander Cain's Battlestar. Presumed lost at the battle of Molecai, it
reappears and disappears again in "The Living Legend".

<H3>5. Rycon</H3>

Commander Kronos' Battlestar. Perished at the Battle of the Cosmara
Archipelago, and mentioned in the episode "Take the Celestra". According
to Mager, this is the correct spelling of the name.

<H2>II. Battlestars Mentioned in Background Dialogue</H2>

<H3>6. Acropolis</H3>

Transcript from the home video version of the pilot (<B>19m:53s</B>):

   <DL><DD><B>Apollo:</B>      Zac?
   <DD><B>Tigh:</B> His ship was destroyed just shortof the the fleet.<P>

   <DD><B>Background:</B> (female) Transferring target scanners to decks 7 and 8.
   <DD><B>Background:</B> (female) <I>Battlestar Atlantia</I> and <I>Acropolis</I> losing
         speed.
   <DD><B>Background:</B> (male) Must regain speed three points to maintain
   <DD>      position with Atlantia.</DL>

This name was also confirmed by New West from the costuming department.

<H3>7. Pacifica</H3>

Transcript from the home video version of the pilot (<B>23m:35s</B>):

   <DL><DD><B>Tigh:</B>    That puts them well within the range of the planets Virgon,
            Sagitarra...
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   and Caprica.<P>

   <DD><B>Background:</B>    (female) No response from the Triton and Pacifica.</DL>

Larry Mager's comments:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>By dialogue on the bridge; this ship was at the ambush -- and
   evidently had an escort ship, a frigate or destroyer-type named
   Triton, also mentioned in the background dialogue and confirmed by
   New West.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Also referenced in page 14 of <I>The Battlestar Galactica Scrapbook</I>, and
the pilot novelization <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> on page 11. The latter
poses problems because it contradicts the above dialog, asserting that
the Atlantia became the fleet's largest Battlestar with the destruction
of the <I>Pacifica</I> <I>prior</I> to the armistice talks.

<H2>III. Other Sources</H2>

These include a list given to novelist Robert Thurston, and costume
department information provided by New West.

<H3>8. Bellerophon</H3>

From list given to Thurston. Also referenced under the section "Tigh" in
<I>Encylopedia Galactica</I>, as <I>Bellerephon</I>. According to Thurston's list,
<I>Bellerophon</I> is the correct spelling.

<H3>9. Cerberus</H3>

From costume department information. Also referenced on page 147 of the
<I>War of the Gods</I> novelization by Nicolas Yermakov:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>I [Adama] was assigned to the Bronze Squadron of the <I>Battlestar
   Cerberus</I>. My wingmates were Lieutenant Cain, who would later command
   the <I>Pegasus</I>, and Lieutenant Apollo. Yahrens later, when my first
   son was born, I named him in honor of my friend.</BLOCKQUOTE>

In the Maximum Press comic anthology <I>Asylum</I>, the first story arch uses
this passage as a basis for its story.

<H3>10. Olympia</H3>

From Thurston's list. Also referenced in <I>The Colonial Warriors
Technical Manual</I>. According to Mager, a variant list has the <I>Valiant</I>
in place of the <I>Olympia</I>.<P>

<H3>11. Prometheus</H3>

From costume department information. Also referenced in <I>The Colonial
Warriors Technical Manual</I>.

<H3>12. Solaria</H3>

From costume department information. Also referenced on page 14 of <I>The
Battlestar Galactica Scrapbook</I>, and page 58 of the pilot novelizaton
<I>Battlestar Galactica</I>. Both publications place the <I>Solaria</I> at Cimtar.<P>
