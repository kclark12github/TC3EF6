<h2>The story of the Galactican font</h2>
I've thought for a couple of years that it would be fun to have a copy of the typeface used for signs on the Galactica and other ships of the fleet, but I never got around to doing it.  Then I stumbled across a freeware font called LynzFont.  It didn't come with any documentation explaining who created it or what its inspiration was, but the letter forms were similar to those on BG.  However, the font was somewhat sloppily designed and didn't have any niceties like kerning. Having that impetus, I painstakingly scanned through the entire series, captured screen shots of all the signage that appeared in the episodes, and modified all of the characters in LynzFont to match.  I ended up changing all of the characters somewhat, so it's not really LynzFont anymore, but I wanted to give at least a little credit to the anonymous designer.<p>
There's no difference between the upper and lowercase in Galactican, but the lowercase letters are kerned a little more carefully, so if you're in a situation where that matters, use all lowercase.<p>
Suggestions for additions or modifications are welcome.<p>
The Galctican font is freeware, but it would make me happy to hear how you've made use of it.<p>
