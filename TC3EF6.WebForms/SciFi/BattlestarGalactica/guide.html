<DD>The story of how the 12 colonies of man are destroyed after a 1000 year war with the evil Cylon Empire.  Through deceit, the Cylons are able to destroy the Colonies' entire fleet, except for the Battlestar Galactica, captained by Commander Adama.  Adama gathers up the few remaining humans left on all the twelve worlds and embarks on a journey to find the mythical planet Earth, the supposed thirteenth colony of Mankind, lost ages ago when humans first left the motherworld, Kobol.  With food and fuel running out, the fleet heads for an ore planet, Carillon, hoping to get what it needs.  The Ovions, who populate the planet, are being controlled by the Cylons, who set a trap for the Galactica.  The fleet gets food and fuel, and escapes, destroying Carillon and a Cylon Base Star.

The Cylons do attack the fleet (with 3 Base Stars), and the Pegasus is pulled out to surprise the Cylons. This works, and the fleet is saved.  Then they launch a surprise attack on Gamoray while the Pegasus takes on the three Base Stars.  The Galactica obtains fuel from Gamoray, but the Pegasus disappears after destroying two of the Cylon ships.

There they find Count Iblis, who claims to be, if not a deity, then the next best thing.  His mysterious powers sway the fleet, as he promises to deliver them if they will follow him.  Adama doubts Iblis' word, but gives him the task of delivering the traitor Baltar, which he does.  Everyone is ready to follow Iblis, but Adama and Apollo soon realize that Iblis is really the Prince of Darkness and that those 'lights' are after him.  In a final battle, Iblis kills Apollo, then is taken away for killing someone who hasn't given himself freely.  Starbuck and Sheba, while bringing Apollo's body back, are captured by the lights, who reveal themselves to be the good version of Iblis' type.

Baltar is to escape in his fighter, along with his Centaurians, while the rest go in the Alliance ship.

The President of the Western people has made a treaty with the Eastern Alliance, in which all hostilities will stop.
