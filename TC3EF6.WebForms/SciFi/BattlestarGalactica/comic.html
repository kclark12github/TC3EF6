<H1>The <i>New</i> Battlestar Galactica Comic</H1>

August 1995 saw the release of the first major Battlestar Galactica-related publication in many years.<p>

The Battlestar Galactica comic from Maximum Press ignores the Galactica:1980 storyline and picks up five yahrens after the destruction of the colonies.<p>

Issues of the comic have been coming out about once a month since August. Reaction from fans has been mixed.  If you'd like to contribute a review to appear on this page, please send it my way. </A>.
