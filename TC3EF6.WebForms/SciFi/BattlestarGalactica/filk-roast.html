<H2>Barker and Fontana Roast Battlestar Galactica</H2><BR>
		     by Lynn Barker and Dorothy Fontana<P>

	(sung to the tune "My Favorite Things" from SOUND OF MUSIC)<P>

Microns and hectares and novas and centons<BR>
Pulsars and turbos and parsecs and metrons<BR>
Used interchangably at every turn,<BR>
These are the things that make SF fans burn.<P>

Centares, cylons, imperious leaders,<BR>
If you were a book, you would lose all your readers.<BR>
Great loards of COBOL have lead you astray.<BR>
Don't you know Earth is the opposite way?<P>

(Chorus)<BR>
	Launch the vipers, hit the turbos, will you make it back?<BR>
	And when you are jumped by a Cylon patrol,<BR>
	Then all you can say is FRACK!<P>

Adama and Boxey, Apollo, Athena<BR>
Starbuck and Boomer and poor dead Serena,<BR>
These are the characters who lead the way.<BR>
Wish that they had something clever to say.<P>

Star systems, galaxies, and asteroids,<BR>
Dust clouds and starfields and small planetoids,<BR>
Science eludes you. You dazzle the eye,<BR>
But we know you're piling the felgercarb high.<P>

(Chorus)<BR>
	Drink ambrosa, play at triad, wait for more attacks.<BR>
	Don't be concerned if in battle you die,<BR>
	The gods will just bring you back.<P>

Scouting patrols and reconnaisance flights<BR>
Snap-rolls at light speed and other strange sights<BR>
Egyptian helmets that glow in the dark<BR>
How come the Cylons can miss such a mark?<P>

GUNS OF NAVARRONE, HEAVEN CAN WAIT,<BR>
Classics like SHANE, and other cinema greats.<BR>
How about some stories that we haven't seen<BR>
Already done on the big silver screen?<P>

(Chorus)<BR>
	Kill the Cylons, frustrate Baltar, hide the plot you lack.<BR>
	Just give us quality in all of your shows,<BR>
	Or all we can say is FRACK!<P>
