<H1>YTV Canada Petition</H1>

     Hi, fellow fans of Galactica.<p>
     
     My name is Marcel St. Pierre, and I am a writer here at YTV Canada. My 
     purpose in writing to you is in letting you know of a remote 
     possibility that we can convince the programming department here at 
     YTV to run Battlestar Galactica. YTV has run many great scifi 
     programs, including Thunderbirds, Space:1999, etc. I wonder if either 
     of you could post the following email address on your various boards, 
     especially on the Galactica home page:<p>
     
        <A HREF=mailto:info@ytv.ca>info@ytv.ca</A><p>
     
     Make sure you mention Galactica in the subject field somewhere. Let's 
     get this address out there and get Galactica on the air here in 
     Canada. Please correspond with me as soon as you can. I'd especially 
     like to get info from either of you re: canadian content in Galactica, 
     other that John colicos and Lorne Greene. Anything you can send me 
     will be included in a report I'll be presenting to the head of 
     programming here. I've already spoken to him about this, and he likes 
     the idea.<p>
     
     Talk to you soon!<p>
     
     Marcel<br>
