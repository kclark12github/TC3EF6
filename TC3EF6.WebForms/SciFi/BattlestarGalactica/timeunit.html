<I>"What's a centon?" - Michael, "Greetings from Earth"</I><P>

Battlestar Galactica fans have been at a loss for words when asked to
explain what terms like <I>centon</I> or <I>micron</I> mean, and other Colonial
time units. These terms were never formally defined in the series. Yet
nobody has yet to produce an air-tight conversion table for the terms.
This document attempts to provide one.<P>

In general, Colonial time terms substitute nicely for more familiar ones
-- <I>centon</I> for minute, <I>micron</I> for second. It is this light that this
document is presented. What follows is a near complete list of the terms
and their probable meanings.<P>

<H2>Major Colonial Time Terms</H2>

<DL><DT><B>millenium (1000 years)</B>
   <DD>1000 <I>yahrens</I>, or 1000 years. According to Adar's speech in the
   pilot episode, the Galacticans were approaching the 7th <I>millenium</I>
   of time, which would place their calendar in the late 6900's. There
   seems to be at least two Colonial calendars, for the Cylon raid on
   Umbra occured in 7322, some 20 <I>yahren</I> before the events in "The Man
   with Nine Lives". The second figure displaces the earlier figure by
   some 300 <I>yahren</I> or so.<P>

<DT><B>yahren (year)</B>
   <DD>The <I>yahren</I> (yah'-rain) best represents the Colonial year, as both
   terms are used interchangeably in the series. In one case year was
   substituted for <I>yahren</I> in the dialog. In President Adar's statement
   in the pilot, he utters "The first peace man has known in a thousand
   years.".Therefore the <I>yahren</I> is the Colonial year. The plural can
   be represented as both <I>yahren</I> and <I>yahrens</I>. Taken from the German
   word for year.<P>

<DT><B>sectar (month?)</B>
   <DD>The <I>sectar</I> (sec'-tar), and its plural <I>sectares</I> (sec-tar'-ays), or
   sometimes <I>sectars</I> , is used mostly in the context of space
   distance, much as <I>micron</I> and <I>centon</I> are. In "Lost Planet of the
   Gods", Lucifer measured the distance between the Galactica and
   Baltar's base ship in <I>sectares</I>. A hidden assumption is that
   <I>sectar</I> is to <I>secton</I> what <I>centar</I> is to <I>centon</I>, a unit composed
   of an unknown number of <I>sectons</I>. Using a base ten system, a
   <I>sectar</I> could represent 10 <I>sectons</I> (or weeks). See <I>micron</I> for
   units that also double as units of space distance.<P>

<DT><B>secton (week)</B>
   <DD>The <I>secton</I> (sec'-tawn) best represents the Colonial week. In "The
   Man With Nine Lives", Apollo complains to Starbuck about how he lost
   a <I>secton</I>'s pay to one of Starbuck's gambling schemes. A purely
   arbirary definition of <I>secton</I> would be 100 <I>centares</I>, as 100 is
   the base for at least one other time unit (<I>centar</I>). There are
   compelling reasons to adopt this definition, as explained later in
   this document.<P>

<DT><B>centar (hour)</B>
   <DD>The <I>centar</I> (sen'-tar) and its plural, <I>centares</I> (sen-tar'-ays), or
   sometimes <I>centars</I>, is the Colonial hour. In "Baltar's Escape",
   Baltar gave Adama three <I>centares</I> to give in to his demands. The
   <I>centar</I> is probably 100 <I>centons</I>, for in "Take the Celestra", the
   <I>Celestra</I>'s mutineering crew says that the Galactica would be within
   its viewing range within a <I>centar</I>. The captain, who does not want
   the ship to be seen, instructs the crew to hail the <I>Galactica</I>
   within 80 <I>centons</I>. In "Take the Celestra", the crew were subjected
   to 16 <I>centares</I> intervals of work, the Colonial equivalent of
   double-shifting. There is an unknown time unit representing a 24
   <I>centar</I> interval. For example, in "The Lost Warrior", Adama gave
   Starbuck and Boomer 24 <I>centares</I> to rescue Apollo. This unknown
   interval is best understood as a day, which constitutes 24 hours.
   Note, the Latin word for 100 is <I>cent</I>.<P>

<DT><B>centon (minute)</B>
   <DD>In all but the first two episodes, <I>centon</I> (sen'-tawn) represents
   the Colonial minute. Witness the use of the expression "wait a
   <I>centon</I>," the Colonial version of "wait a minute." In "Gun on Ice
   Planet Zero", Starbuck and Apollo's chronometers were synchronized to
   80 <I>centons</I>, the length of their mission to blow up the Ravishol
   Pulsar. For a discussion of the first two episodes and the original
   <I>centon</I>, see the next section.<P>

<DT><B>micron (second)</B>
   <DD>The <I>micron</I> is best understood as the Colonial second. A <I>centon</I> is
   100 <I>microns</I>, for when Apollo's counter hits one <I>centon</I> in "Gun On
   Ice Planet Zero", it starts counting down from 100 to 1. The <I>micron</I>
   is also used as a term of space distance in the series. When Rigel
   tells the fleet that the Cylon patrol craft are "three <I>microns</I> and
   closing," she is using <I>micron</I> in the same way that we use the
   expression light year. A light year represents the distant light
   travels within one year. Here <I>micron</I> represents the distance
   covered in one <I>micron</I> within an unknown fixed velocity. No relation
   to the Terran micron, or micrometer (one millionth of a meter.)</DL>

<H2>The First Two Episodes - Centon versus Senton</H2>

The discussion in this section covers units used almost exclusively in
the pilot and "Lost Planet of the Gods", including the possible original
context of <I>centon</I>. The time units used in these episodes seem to
conform to a different system than those used in other episodes. These
include <I>senton</I>, <I>millisenton</I>, and <I>microsenton</I>. The units here are
more obviously metric than those used outside these episodes. A
different spelling for <I>senton</I> is used here to distinguish it from the
<I>centon</I> used throughout the rest of the series.<P>

<DL><DT><B>senton (week)</B>
   <DD>While it is well known that <I>centon</I> substituted well for minute in
   the series, the pilot episode provides compelling evidence that this
   was not always the case. At the Council session dealing with
   Carillon, Apollo informs the Council that Adama's plan would take the
   fleet <I>sentons</I> out of the way from its intended destination
   (Carillon). Later, Sire Uri informs the fleet that the voyage might
   resume within a <I>senton</I>. The <I>senton</I> may have originally been
   intended to represent the original Colonial week, represented by
   <I>secton</I> in most of the series. Although the <I>senton</I>-as-day seems to
   work as well as the <I>senton</I>-as-week, the presence of two other time
   units, <I>microsentons</I> and <I>millisentons</I>, and their respective metric
   conventions, supports the latter view. It is suggested that the
   Colonials redefined <I>senton</I> at one point to reflect "minute"
   (spelled as <I>centon</I> in this document), and that <I>senton</I> represents
   a pre-Destruction use of the term. The other two terms almost
   disappeared from the series.<P>

<DT><B>millisenton (10 minutes)</B>
   This unit is used usually in the context of a few minutes. In "Lost
   Planet of the Gods", Adama says that they have been dining for three
   <I>millisentons</I>. Only one other episode uses this unit. In "The Living
   Legend", Sheba informs the mission crew that they have only a few
   <I>millisentons</I> to get in and out of Gamoray. Using the
   <I>senton</I>-as-week theory, the <I>millisenton</I> becomes 1/1000 of a
   <I>senton</I> (or <I>secton</I>). Therefore, a <I>millisenton</I> constitutes 10
   <I>centons</I> (or 10 minutes.) Adama's repast, therefore, becomes 30
   minutes, a reasonable legnth of time to eat. In the pilot, in the
   beginning of the Carillon sequences Greenbeam informs Apollo that is
   landram is 24 <I>millisentons</I> from the Tylium mine. That's 240
   <I>centons</I> or 4 hours if a <I>centon</I> represents one minute.<P>

<DT><B>microsenton (second)</B>
   <DD>Used by Starbuck in "Lost Planet of the Gods", in the context of one
   second. This unit was later taken over by the unit by <I>micron</I>, which
   was used exclusively in the first two episodes as a unit of space
   distance. In the metric system, <I>micro</I> represents one millionth.
   Using the <I>senton</I>-as-week rule, the <I>microsenton</I> becomes 1
   millionth of a <I>senton</I>. If the <I>senton</I> (or <I>secton</I>) represents
   exactly 1 Earth week, the <I>microsenton</I> (or <I>micron</I>) would clock at
   0.6 seconds.</DL>

<H3>Minor Colonial Time Units</H3>

<DL><DT><B>quarton (week/fortnight/month)</B>
<DD>In "The Magnificent Warriors", Adama complained that "I've been cooped
up on this ship for 16 <I>quartons</I>." Adama's last previous excursion off
the ship was in the episide "Lost Planet of the Gods". Possibly a week,
fortnight (14 days) or a month. The time period between the two episodes
would be a choice between 4 and 16 months. A <I>quarton</I> equivalent to one
secton (week) causes the least problems. The <I>quarton</I> is derived from
the Latin word for four.</DL>

<H2>A Sample Conversion Table</H2>

Based on the pseudo-metric used in the series, and a base 100 ratio,
here is a sample table for the four main Colonial units, using <I>secton</I>
as exactly one week. Note, the <I>centon</I> is almost exactly one minute,
for there are 10,080 minutes within an Earth week, and 10,000 <I>centons</I>
within a <I>secton</I>.<P>

<UL><LI><I>secton</I> - 1 week
<LI><I>centar</I> - 101 minutes (1.7 hours)
<LI><I>centon</I> - 1 minute
<LI><I>micron</I> - 0.6 seconds<P></UL>

This is an extremely attractive conversion table, and conforms to the
hidden assumptions for each of the four basic units. All tables present
their own set of problems. The double-shift on the <I>Celestra</I> consisting
of 16 <I>centares</I> is equivalent to almost 27 hours of non-stop work. We
know from the episode that 16 <I>centares</I> represents an extraordinary
length of time for a work shift. The Colonials may have a higher
capacity for duration between sleep cycles. With this in mind, the 27
hour shift becomes slightly more palatable.<P>

<H2>A Guide to Galactica Storytellers</H2>

Trying to create or utilize a Colonial time conversion table can be a
distracting exercise. In constructing scripts and stories (outside of
time-critical situtations), the best option is to assume that each of
the terms uses their nearest Earth equivalents -- such as year for
<I>yahren</I>, week for <I>secton</I>, hour for <I>centar</I>, minute for <I>centon</I>, and
second for <I>micron</I>, or even use the Terran time terms. In most of the
episodes, this is exactly what the writers did.<P>

In time-critical situations, where relationships between the units are a
must, the best option is to provide a table reference (such as the one
above,) before proceeding with a Galactica adventure.<P></BODY>
