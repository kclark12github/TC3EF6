DIRK BENEDICT: Young Hero of "Battlestar Galactica"<p>

For years, Dirk Benedict didn't work too much because of his looks.
He was too handsome. At the time, movie makers wanted average-
looking types.<p>

But he's very hot now. Producers think he's perfect as Lt. Starbuck
on "Battlestar Galactica." Only someone as good looking as Dirk
could play this ace pilot/con artist/ladies man!<p>

Dirk was born and raised in White Sulphur Springs, Montana. His
town had no theater or movie house, and few TV sets. Dirk amused
himself by hunting, fishing, and playing football. In college, his
football pals dared him to try out for a musical. From then on,
Dirk was "hooked"! After studying drama he won parts in plays, and
eventually in TV shows like "Chopper One" and "Battlestar
Galactica."<p>

Dirk describes himself as a "dreamer and a romantic." His goal in
life if to "follow out" every talent he has.
