<H1>Who Killed Galactica?</H1>

by William Adams<P>

<I>Battlestar Galactica</I> was not a failure. By every method used to
measure television it was a success, perhaps even the strongest new show
of the 78-79 season. The average rating for a successful new series is
<H3><A NAME="18">18. <I>Battlestar</I>, at 20.4, was a full five million viewers above that</A></H3>
average and one of the top 25 series on television. It was the sixth
highest rated new series for the entire season, and before ABC began
fooling with the show, it was pulling ratings of 22 and 23, high enough
to make it one of the top 15 series on TV. As for the audience shares,
for a successful new series the average is 28. <I>Battlestar</I>, at 32, was
again well above the norm.<P>

[The demographics are] broken into five major divisions: Women 18-49,
Men 18-49, Teenagers, Children, and over 50s. <I>Galactica</I> placed in the
top ten with three of the groups and in the top 20 for a fourth. Only a
handful of programs can match those demographics and all of them are
still on.<P>

Its competition was the strongest on television, with both CBS and NBC
stacking their schedules against it. The night itself was only a
moderate success. ABC hadn't done any better than second place for
years. The leadin, <I>The Hardy Boys</I>, had an average rating of 13 and the
program that followed <I>Battlestar</I> was a movie where the ratings
depended on what was showing. None of the requirements needed to break
23 was present. In fact, <I>Battlestar</I> shouldn't have broken 20. Yet it
did, and when the competition was just another new series, it broke 24.
Its ratings were so high CBS panicked, booted <I>Mary Tyler Moore</I> out and
rearranged their entire schedule less than one month into the season.
They took four of their five top series and formed a wall against
<I>Galactica</I>. NBC didn't have enough strong series to move, so they
countered with their best movies, biggest miniseries and most publicized
specials. NBC lost. CBS won, barely. <I>Battlestar</I>'s ratings declined two
points to fluctuate between 21 and 23, still  within the top 15 shows on
TV.<P>

<I>Battlestar</I> did not cost ABC a million dollars an episode. According to
<I>Variety</I> the price was more like $750,000, for which ABC bought the
rights to show each episode twice (and you were wondering why such a
failure reran all summer.) That was the same per hour fee ABC was paying
for one showing only of the lower rated <I>Monday Night Football</I> and most
of their Hollywood movies.<P>

Universal Studios probably was paying a million dollars an episode, but
it's not unusual for a producer to lose money. On a series like
<I>Charlie's Angels</I> the producers were losing between one and five
million dollars a year. A producer makes money by owning a series that
runs long enough to go into syndicated reruns. Once that happens, the
rental fees make up for the original losses. Yet, in spite of a first
season cancellation and a $250,000 per episode loss, Univeral was happy.
The release of <I>Battlestar</I>'s motion picture version had already paid
for all production. The money from ABC was profit.<P>

As far as Universal was concerned, Battlestar was a financial miracle.
Even ABC, despite rumors to the contrary, did not lose money on the
series. According to figures from <I>Advertising Age</I>, <I>A.C. Nielson</I>, and
<I>Variety</I>, after all fees had been paid, ABC still netted over 15
million dollars, and no matter how they pad the accounts, that still
comes out to several million in pure profit.<P>

Battlestar did not plunge down the ratings ladder. I'm well aware ABC
can show a 14 point drop. It's done by carefully selecting the highest
and lowest weekly figures. But, if that's how a plunge is figured,
<I>Alice</I>, <I>All in the Family</I>, <I>Fantasy Island</I>, <I>Happy Days</I>, and a
dozen other shows beat the <I>Galactica</I> to the bottom and lived to tell
about it.<P>

So why was <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> cancelled? In short, ABC didn't want
it. The series was too expensive, so ABC killed it. That's not sour
grapes, that's the conclusion of a controversial study conducted at Ball
State University in Indiana.<P>

"Hard core" SF can not produce enough profit to satisfy the networks
even though the networks would love to have the SF community among their
viewers. That's why we get an endless line of programming like <I>Mr.
Merlin</I> and <I>The Incredible Hulk</I>, which are relatively cheap to make,
but not one hard core SF series since <I>Star Trek</I> has been allowed to
stay on. Because advertising rates are based on cost per-thousand
viewers rather than cost of production, the average <I>Galactica</I>-like
series needs ratings over 30 just to produce the same profits <I>Real
People</I> will make with 19.<P>

ABC, at the time the richest of the three, went with <I>Battlestar</I>, but
only as a three-part miniseries. Unfortunately for them, once word got
out, public reaction was so strong the network was forced to change its
plans and order a full-fledged weekly series, but there was no intention
of letting it succeed. ABC began by hyping the show. That means instead
of buying ads, they got papers to give them free space under the heading
of news.<P>

No series in the history of television had ever been so hyped. In one
three-week period it was the cover story for <I>Newsweek</I>, <I>People</I>, <I>US</I>,
<I>TV Guide</I>, and almost all of the "TV Weeklies" published in local
newspapers. During the same period it was a major part of <I>Time</I> and
even the <I>Smithsonian</I> magazine did a special section on how it was
being filmed. Everyone in the country thought they knew all about the
series. Rumors were rampant. One SF magazine finally flew an editor to
Canada just to view the actual film and hopefully find out what was
really going on. Such massive hyping guaranteed two things. First of
all, a huge opening audience, and secondly, an audience loss. For
<I>Dallas</I> the loss between the "who shot J.R." episode and the next week
was over 15 million viewers. Such a loss is expected. No series has ever
been able to maintain a hyped rating. Yet in the case of <I>Battlestar</I>,
which dropped from a rating of 28 to 25, or a loss of about nine million
people, ABC claimed a decline proved the show couldn't hold an audience.<P>
