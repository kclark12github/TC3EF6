<H1>Can Battlestar Ride the Sci-Fi Wave?</H1><P>

By Karen Stabiner<P>

<B>HOLLYWOOD</B> - An experienced Universal Studio employee shakes his head in
bewilderment: "That <I>Buck Rogers</I> of ours is bringing in just piles of
money. I don't know why -- there are good films around that aren't
making a dime. And the studio is expecting <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> to do
as well as <I>Buck Rogers</I>"<P>

Adding to the staffer's perturbation is that <I>Buck Rogers in the 25th
Century</I>, which since its March premiere has grossed a reported $20
million, and <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>, which opens at some 400 theaters
across the country on Friday, both started out as projects designed for
television. Indeed, though the <I>Battlestar</I> coming to theaters is spiced
up with a Sensurround aural track, it is basically a condensed version
of the three-hour science-fiction pilot telecast by ABC last September;
the series has just been scrubbed from the network's fall schedule, but
who can predict the vagaries of movie-goers' tastes?<P>

Glen A. Larson, the 40-year-old producer responsible for these two films
and a string of TV series (such as <I>McCloud</I>, <I>The Hardy Boys Nancy New</I>
and the current <I>Quincy</I> and <I>B.J. and the Bear</I>), thinks that
"Battlestar" will do just fine at the box office because science fiction
is still potent in its appeal.<P>

Sitting in his office under the shadow of "The Black Tower," as the
Universal headquarters building is known, Mr. Larson says the studio
test-marketed the film version of <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> and found that
"people who like this stuff <I>really</I> like it." An overseas release has
done well; in London, <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> broke a house record
recently set by <I>Grease</I>. In addition, while conceding no new footage
was created for the film, he promises American audiences will see a
"dynamically and esthetically" different product than the TV version, in
part because of "third generation" sound equipment that Mr. Larson
thinks will make all the blastoffs and landings more exciting. As he
says, without even a trace of wryness, "It will be much more fulfilling
and satisfying to watch the end of a civilization in a theater, in
Sensurround, than in your living room."<P>

If he is right -- if <I>Battlestar</I> even approaches the box-office orbit
of <I>Buck Rogers</I> -- Mr. Larson will have notched up a unique industry
achievement: he will have broken the old rule that says a property will
not translate from the small home screen to the neighborhood theater or
drive-in.<P>

--<P>

What does Mr. Larson offer, in his film and TV productions, that is such
an audience draw? Laughter, he says. Looking past the glass jar on his
desk that is labeled "cyanide" but contains candy, he says the common
denominator of such projects as <I>McCloud</I>, <I>Quincy</I> and his campy
science-fiction films is "dark humor."<P>

But beyond the confines of his darkwood, Muzak-filled office, some
industry observers are less kind.<P>

It is said that most of Mr. Larson's projects can be traced back to
another source: the short-lived TV series <I>Alias Smith and Jones</I> to the
Newman-Redford film <I>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</I>; <I>McCloud</I> to
Clint Eastwood's <I>Coogan's Bluff</I>; <I>The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew</I> to
the kid's books; <I>Buck Rogers</I> to the original comic strip; the NBC
series <I>B.J. and the Bear</I>, about a truck driver and his chimpanzee pal,
to Clint Eastwood's 1978 <I>Every Which Way But Loose</I>, about a truck
driver and his chimpanzee pal; and <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> to <I>Star
Wars</I>.<P>

The accusation has followed Mr. Larson around for years and has made
him, he admits, "kind of sensitive."<P>

He quickly points out that he became involved with <I>McCloud</I> as a writer
<I>after</I> the pilot had been filmed, and was not, therefore, responsible
for whatever similarities it displayed to an earlier film. He says that
<I>B.J. and the Bear</I> was completed a year before it aired -- before Mr.
Eastwood's film was underway. And he will not discuss
<I>BattlestarGalactica</I> vis-a-vis <I>Star Wars</I> because George Lucas,
creator of the most potent box-office hit ever, is suing over the
similarities between <I>Battlestar</I> and his film, and the legions of
lawyers working on the case have advised Mr. Larson to remain silent.<P>

But Mr. Larson dismisses the critics who claim it is just the latest
example of his unoriginal thinking: "It's a compliment, actually,
because it means you're thinking in the mainstream. The actual incidence
of coincidence is so high that you'd have to sit on the side of the
desk, to listen to how nine out of 10 writers have the same idea, to
believe how bad it gets."<P>

Instead, he prefers to fret about whether Universal is marketing his two
films correctly. <I>Buck Rogers</I>, made as an NBC mini-series but sold back
to Universal as a consolation prize after the network, under new head
Fred Silverman, canceled several of the studio's novels-for-TV, was
given a "saturation release" -- it opened in more theaters than <I>Jaws</I>
and <I>The Sting</I>. But Mr. Larson thinks the film's advertising campaign
was "too narrow. The brass underestimated the potential of <I>Buck Rogers</I>
as an adult piece; they aimed the TV ads at a young television buy.
Saturday Mornings and all that. They wanted to get in and out of the
theaters quick.<P>

"And since it was originally targeted for TV, they thought they wouldn't
get good critical response. To our annoyance and the studio's surprise,
they were wrong. We got exceptional reviews. We got what you'd call
'money reviews.' Had <I>Buck Rogers</I> been sold like <I>Superman</I> was sold,
they could have quadrupled their grosses."<P>

That last bit of multiplication may be open to debate, but Universal has
clearly changed its plans for marking the film version of <I>Battlestar
Galactica</I>. The initial thought, several months back, was to release it
only in Canada and overseas. But the film's performance there, combined
with the showing of <I>Buck Rogers</I> in the US, convinced Universal to
spring for such advertisements as a mammoth billboard on Sunset
Boulevard and in Los Angeles, posters on the rumps of many of the city's
buses.<P>

--<P>

Mr. Larson has had what appears to be easy success in several fields --
on stage (before entering TV, he was for 10 years a member of <I>The Four
Preps</I> singing group), in television and now in films. And he fully
intends to make matters even worse in the future for those who envy him:
Mr. Larson is currently working on:<P>

<OL><LI>       A second year of <I>B.J. and the Bear</I>, as well as a spin-off
series from it titled <I>The Misadventures of Lobo</I>;<P>

<LI>       A <I>Buck Rogers</I> TV series for NBC's fall schedule;<P>

<LI>       A second <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> feature film for the European
market [<I>Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack</I>], using "what we've
already shot for TV and some new footage. And though the TV "Battlestar"
series has been canceled, ABC recently asked Mr. Larson for a two-hour
TV movie "in which <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> discovers the planet Earth."
The producer will not deny the possibility that this could serve as a
pilot for a reborn TV series, especially since at least one ABC
affiliate has been picketed by youngsters demanding that the show be
reinstated.</OL>

At the moment, Mr. Larson has no original feature film planned. But once
his current projects either dry up or begin functioning on automatic
pilot, he wants to concentrate more on comedy -- leading, perhaps, to
the legitimate stage.<P>

"I'd love to do a musical comedy on Broadway someday," says Mr. Larson,
who in addition to his singing career helped create the theme music for
both <I>B.J. and the Bear</I> and <I>Battlestar</I>. "I know how to work a crowd.
I just came back from New York, where I saw a couple of shows I loved.
But I saw some others that make me think I might be up to the
challenge."<P>
