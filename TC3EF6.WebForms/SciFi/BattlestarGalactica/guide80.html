<DD>At Last, the Galactica finds the planet Earth!  It's the year 1980 A.D., and their hopes are dashed when they find that the planet does not have the technology to help defeat the Cylons.  In fact, the Earth is bad off as it is.  The Galactica leaves Earth, so that the Cylons following do not find it, but send down Lt. Troy (formerly Boxey, Adama's grandson) and Lt. Dillon to contact Prof. Mortinson, a man they feel can help them to advance Earth's technology quick enough to be of help.  There is trouble, in the form of Xavier, one of the Council of Twelve who feels that the Galacticans should upgrade Earth by travelling into the past and introducing modern devices (Dr. Zee has developed a time-travel device and a cloaking device, both outfitted into Vipers).  He goes to Nazi Germany, not caring about the consequences, and Troy and Dillon, joined by reporter Jamie Hamilton of Earth, follow him.  They undo his damage, but lose Xavier somewhere in time.  Adama goes ahead with his plan to slowly upgrade Earth, Prof. Mortinson is told that someday he will meet them again, and Jamies joins the Colonial fleet.

With Jamie's help, they disguise themselves as scouts, but they get into some trouble, such as when Dillon tries to change his gold cubits in for American currency, and accidentally robs a bank.  With the police after them, the group camp out in the woods.  However, some of the children become ill from drinking polluted water from a chemical plant, and there is a problem with the Colonists' bizarre anatomies.  The children are saved, however, and the plant is closed down.

<DD>At last, the fate of Starbuck is revealed.  Prof. Zee was revealed in the premier to be a mutant.  He is a child genius.  He has a dream about Starbuck, which he relates to Adama, who knows the story to be true.

<DD>Fourteen years earlier, while in a battle, Starbuck's Viper was gravely damaged, and Boomer watched him wildly fly towards a planet.  The fleet could not go back for him, since the Cylons were on their tail.  Starbuck crashed onto the barren planet, his ship all but destroyed.  There he finds the remains of a Cylon fighter, of which one Cylon he is able to fix.  He does this out of loneliness.  Cy, as he names him, first wishes to kill Starbuck, because he is a human, but soon learns that they need each other, and they become friends (to both of their surprise).  Then a mysterious pregnant woman appears, and Starbuck does his all to care for her, which makes Cy jealous.  However, Cy helps Starbuck build a tiny ship out of the remains of both their ships, and after the woman gives birth, launches the baby into space, the mysterious woman is gone.  It was surmised that she was from another dimension.  Soon after, a Cylon patrol lands on the planet, and when they find Starbuck they attempt to kill him.  However, Cy gives his life? to save Starbuck, killing two of the Cylons before the third guns him down.  Starbuck finishes off the third Cylon, but Cy is too far gone to be fixed.  Starbuck is left alone again.

<DD>Adama reveals to Zee that he had come to the fleet in a small ship, and his identity is revealed.
