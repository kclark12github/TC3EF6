<title>Fanzine Clippings</title>
<h1>Fanzine Clippings</h1>
The following are clippings from one of the teen idol fanzines,
"TigerBeat" I think, from late 1978 or early 1979. It's the last
part of what was probably carried over several issues: A listing of
630 miscellaneous facts about BG: the show, the characters, the
actor's lives etc. Unfortunately, I only have Facts 596-630 :(<p>

NOTE! These "facts" are copied directly from the article clippings
I have. The writing is poor, the facts may not even be
true, but... go ahead and enjoy it in good clean fun!<p>
