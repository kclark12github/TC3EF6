<TITLE>Galactica Filk</TITLE>
<H2>The Battlestar Galactica Drinking Song</H2>
by Children of an Idle Brain (John Burridge and Mark Heiman)<P>

Tune: mostly the main theme from Holst's "Jupiter"<BR>
[Imagine our heros relaxing in the Galactica bar...]<p>

Here we are in space again<BR>
No planet for our berth<BR>
On the Battlestar Galactica<BR>
Towards a planet known as Earth<P>

Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny<BR>
In our rag-tag patched-up fleet<BR>
Spreading disco and bad haircuts<BR>
To the people we meet<P>

Bridge (silly waltz tune I can't name):<BR>
[growing progressively more intoxicated]<P>
Did you ever see Adama go this way or that way?<BR>
Did you ever see Adama go this way or that?<P>

(original tune)<BR>
Shoot a viper out the launch tube<BR>
See the Cylon's flashing eye<BR>
We've got miles and miles of stock footage:<BR>
See the Battlestar go by...
