<B>LOS ANGELES</B>, Jan. 26, 1980 (AP) - It isn't often that a network admits
it made a mistake and tries to revive a canceled series.<P>

<I>Battlestar Galactica</I> is returning with a two-part pilot on ABC this
Sunday night and the next.<P>

"ABC has said it felt it made a mistake in not picking us up for a
second year," said Lorne Greene, who starred as Commander Adama in the
space drama and is the only cast member to survive the transition.<P>

"When the ratings came in for the hundred series on the air we were No.
24. Which is a respectable rating when you consider the handicap we had
last year."<P>

Greene said ABC rushed the series onto the air too fast. "We were
originally going to do a miniseries. A three-hour show and two two-hour
shows. When we were still in production for the first show ABC ordered
13 more hours.<P>

"As a result," he said, "we couldn't be on every week - and you've just
got to be on every week to succeed. We couldn't produce the shows
quickly enough. Some shows were finished on Sunday morning just in time
to go on the air."<P>

Greene said he hopes if the series is picked up ABC will allow enough
time for preparation.<P>

The show has undergone many changes since it was last seen.<P>

The new title will be <I>Galactica 1980</I>. There's a new cast, except for
Greene, and he's 20 pounds thinner than he was last year.<P>

Another change is in the concept. Thirty years are supposed to have
elapsed and the Galactica has reached earth. It will no longer be a
space-age <I>Wagon Train</I>, meandering across a celestial prairie.<P>

The troubles of <I>Galactica</I> ran deeper than not having enough time to
prepare.<P>

It had a Biblical feeling about it, and perhaps because of that took
itself too seriously. It rarely evoked the fun of <I>Star Wars</I> or the
optimism of <I>Star Trek</I>.<P>

Its large cast made it difficult to sort out the various players. It
became impossible to tell who was Starbuck and who was Apollo, and their
dialogue was interchangeable.<P>

It bore no identifiable relationship to earth, other than the fact that
earth was their destination. The only villains were the Cylons, a band
of robots who became quite tiresome after a while.<P>

The new cast includes Kent McCord, Barry Van Dyke, and Robyn Douglas as
an earthling newswoman who joins the <I>Galactica</I> crew in search of a
story. Greene wears a beard and although three decades have passed, he's
still in the prime of life - their age span is 200 years.<P>

The new show has earth identification, plus the added gimmick that the
Galacticans are able to move about in time. They use that ability to
tinker with events in an effort to alter history and make the world
better. The ethics of that aside, it will allow them a wide range of
stories over many historical eras.<P>

"It's a lighter show than the original," said Greene. "We make light
comments about ourselves and earth. When we see the smog around Los
Angeles someone comments that it must be a radiation shield. There are
also comments on the freeway traffic and nuclear energy."<P>
