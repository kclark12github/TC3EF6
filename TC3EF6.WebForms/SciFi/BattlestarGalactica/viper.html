VIPER for Windows is an arcade game that resembles the classic arcade game
"Defender".  Fly your Viper in defense of your fleet and EARTH.  You will
also be given the helm of a Cylon Raider for some missions (there was demand
to be the 'bad guys').<p>

Use your sensors on the bottom of the screen to determine exactly where the
Cylon or Colonial craft (depending on which role you are playing at the
time)are attacking, then INTERCEPT.<p>

You also have the opportunity to pilot the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and engage a
CYLON BASE STAR head on.<p>

This game has the same missions from <A HREF=viper13.html>the original "Viper"</A>, but graphically
enhanced and with some bug fixes.  Also included are several NEW missions.
As opposed to having a storyline, you may select from the main menu which
mission you want to play, and continuously run each mission until you are
bored silly.<p>

<b>Note:</b> Viper DELUXE has been known to pause at the introduction on some systems.
This is due to the fact that the game uses far more than 256 colors.  Should
you run into such a problem, please try to increase your resolution.<p>

After downloading, simply unzip the file in a directory of your choice.  Read
the file README.TXT for installation and game directions.<p>
