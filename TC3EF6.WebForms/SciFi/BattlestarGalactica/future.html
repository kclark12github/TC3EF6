<H1>ABC's Multi-Million Dollar SF Gamble: Battlestar Galactica</H1>
<B>(cover: Behind The Scenes: What $20 Million Can Buy!)</B><P>

by David Houston<P>

Whatever historians hold in store for it, <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> is sure
to remembered by many as the most extraordinary show ever produced by
American television -- a phenomenon with more than its share of
"firsts." Consider the legal fires out of which it arose, a singed but
soaring Phoenix:<P>

In early summer, 20th Century-Fox sued Universal Studios (MCA) for
copyright infringement, claiming that <I>Galactica</I> was a flat out copy of
<I>Star Wars</I> -- and was being advertised as such by Universal. An
executive at Universal argued that this was like the first Western movie
every made suing the second. "We're not losing any sleep over it," he
said unofficially.<P>

But someone at Universal was losing sleep, for within weeks Universal
had announced their suit against Fox, claiming that their half-pint
robot idea (R2D2) was a direct steal from Universal's <I>Silent Running</I>.<P>

Around this time, George Lucas, creator of <I>Star Wars</I>, visited
Universal, saw the first three hours of <I>Galactica</I>, and said he would
not join Fox in their suit against it. <I>Galactica</I> creator Glen A.
Larson reported that to <I>Variety</I> -- and Lucas felt obliged to inform
Variety directly that he <I>did</I> think <I>Galactica</I> infringed on the
prerogatives of <I>Star Wars</I>, but that since the property was owned by
Fox, not Lucas, he couldn't be a party to the suit if he wanted to.<P>

More paper bullets flew. Fox then sued Universal to prevent them from
marketing <I>Galactica</I> toys and merchandise (since, Fox claimed, they
were derived from stolen property); Universal countersued, asking Fox
for damages because of a "violation of the California business and
professional code."<P>

Meanwhile, a theatrical version of <I>Galactica</I> -- pared down a bit here,
beefed up a bit there -- based on the three-hour TV pilot, opened in
Canada. And nothing happened. Except that money rolled in for Universal
and everybody along the <I>Galactica</I> bread line.<P>

At the same time, production on subsequent hours for television
continued to roll at Universal Studios. With the multi-million-dollar
suits hanging over them, the production company worked blithely away.
(If Fox had won all its points in court, Universal would have been
seriously crippled.)<P>

Apparently no one knows exactly how much <I>Galactica</I> is costing. An
average hour-long show of any other series seldom tops $300,000. The
<I>Galactica</I> office announced a budget of around $7 million for their
initial deal -- a three-hour pilot and two two-hour episodes. That
averages out to $1 million per hour. On an average, that tops previous
TV budgets. However, after completion of the first three-hour story,
reputable sources were saying the budget had already topped $9 million
($3 million per hour); and Canadian publicity for the theatrical release
claimed that <I>Galactica</I> was two years in the making at a cost of over
$14 million.<P>

An ABC-TV source said, "But you have to spread that out all over the
place -- start-up sets, costumes and special effects for the whole
series, special advertising and promotion for the theatrical release
unrelated to TV costs. And if it's been two years in the making... well,
maybe two years from the day it first crossed Glen Larson's mind."
Larson is creator, writer and executive producer for Universal.<P>

Actor Dirk Benedict (who plays Starbuck in <I>Galactica</I>) said it was his
impression that, "They're spending so much money they're embarrassed to
admit how much!" A single visit to one of the main <I>Galactica</I> sets
easily indicates how Benedict got his idea. The electronics alone for
the "bridge" of the starship cost a reported $1.5 million.<P>

Actor Richard Hatch (who plays Captain Apollo -- he's sort of a "Luke
Skywalker" to Benedict's "Han Solo") also mentioned the money angle.
"Most companies have to continuously cut corners, settle for less than
the best. Not <I>Galactica</I>." Hatch has been pleased and surprised more
than once by the time-and-money-consuming care taken to reshoot a scene
until it looks just right. "They know it's all the little places that
count."<P>

Back at the network, ABC executives just settled back and enjoyed all
the publicity generated by the lawsuits. They people who <I>bought</I>
Universal's new space fantasy were indemnified against loss and were not
party to the legal warfare. Furthermore, when ABC saw the first half
hour or so of the edited <I>Galactica</I>, the network quickly withdrew its
offer to buy a three-hour and two two-hour pilots and told Universal to
go right into weekly series production without every having shown a
pilot. Thus, before the lawsuits had been settled, before the movie
opened in Canada, and before the America public had seen a single minute
of the epic, <I>Galactica</I> had moved into the planning of its eight-
through-thirteenth hours of programming, and the two-hour dramas had
been converted into two-part episodes, to be shown in consecutive weeks.<P>

Until the time of the expansion of the ABC-Universal deal, all special
effects had been under the supervision of John Dykstra, who also served
as producer for the three-hour pilot. Universal leased Dykstra's
company, Industrial Light and Magic, and temporarily called it
"Universal 57." Dykstra had created the history-making effects of <I>Star
Wars</I> and, regrettably, this probably amounts for some of the claim that
<I>Galactica</I> looks like <I>Star Wars</I>. The spaceships, aliens and other
miniatures and special effects were all different, but Dykstra's design
and photographic style were omnipresent.<P>

Dennis Muren (who photographed effects for both <I>Star Wars</I> and <I>Close
Encounters of the Third Kind</I>) thinks the <I>Galactica</I> effects are in
many ways better than those of <I>Star Wars</I>. Muren said it took
Industrial Light and Magic almost the whole of <I>Star Wars</I>' shooting
time to master their new equipment and techniques. "Two dozen shots in
<I>Galactica</I>," he said, are "as good as the three or four best shots in
<I>Star Wars</I>."<P>

It seems safe to assume that never before in television history has one
series spent so much of its budget on special effects; nor has the
importance of special effects previously led to the <I>effects man</I>
becoming made overall producer to insure artistic integration of the
work. Following the completion of the three-hour pilot (and the stocking
of a vast library of special effects which are to be used repeatedly)
Dykstra was relieved of producing duties. Larson then hired another
science-fiction luminary to be his principal producer -- Leslie Stevens,
who was the fountainhead of <I>The Outer Limits</I>. (Stevens is also
assisting Larson on Universal's other new space fantasy, <I>Buck Rogers</I>.)<P>

Dykstra continued to concentrate on special effects -- more stock shots
and the individual effects needed for each show. From persistent
reports, however, it seems likely that by the time these words are read,
John Dykstra will no longer be associated with the project. It is
expected that Dykstra will be offered the opportunity to continue as
head of special effects, and that he will turn it down -- as soon as the
seventh hour of his original commitment is finished.<P>

As Dennis Muren puts it, "<I>Galactica</I> is a labor of love, and we're
getting paid for it; but it will be nice to get on to other things." For
Muren, "other things" includes special effects photography for <I>Star
Wars II</I>, which begins this fall at a new installation in San Francisco.
For Dykstra, "other things" probably means moving into the sphere of
full motion-picture production (not just special effects.) He and
associate Robert Shepherd are currently shopping for scripts and novels-
to-convert for the first of their productions. (<I>Star Wars II</I> will be
overseen by Brian Johnson, who did effects for <I>Space: 1999</I>.)<P>

Regarding Dykstra's departure from <I>Galactica</I>, an ABC spokesman said,
"In any case, his credit will always appear, as <I>creator</I> of <I>Galactica</I>
special effects."<P>

<I>Galactica</I> is unusual -- and unusually expensive -- on many levels,
other than special effects. The cast of ten regulars, including highly-
paid Lorne Greene, should be compared with the casts of three or four
"in" shows like <I>The Rockford Files</I>, <I>Baretta</I>, <I>Quincy</I>, and <I>Project
UFO</I>. And take not of the location shooting -- Egypt, for instance,
where a second-unit crew went to photograph the ruins at Luxor to
represent the crumbled civilization on the planet from which all human
life in the galaxy has migrated. This second unit was busy at a time
when <I>Galactica</I> was already tying up five of Universal's biggest sound
stages.<P>

And the armies of exceptionally fine consumes come from exceptionally
expensive Jean-Pierre Dorleac, a world-famous designer.<P>

Symphonic scores are not unique to television, but <I>Galactica</I>'s
sweeping music by Stu Phillips was recorded by the Los Angeles
Philharmonic -- in the young tradition established by John Williams'
Oscar-winning <I>Star Wars</I> score. Larson claims he would have used a
symphonic score anyway, though, because he sees <I>Galactica</I> as myth and
Biblical allegory, very classical at its literary core.<P>

"I started to cry when I first heard the score," Larson said; "it's so
beautiful." Larson's earliest career -- before he became a TV writer and
then a producer -- was in the music business. (He was one of the Four
Freshman.)<P>

Once all the charges of copyright infringement and the other legal
elbowing have subsided, and once other modern space fantasies like <I>Buck
Rogers</I>, <I>Star Trek -- The Motion Picture</I>, <I>Starcrash</I>, and <I>Flash
Gordon</I> have come out to keep <I>Galactica</I> company, it will be more
evident that <I>Galactica</I> was innovative in many ways all its own -- not
the least of which is its courageous, almost carefree use of funds in
the hope of bringing to the public a TV fantasy of unparalleled quality.
And some of the daring can be seen in things that neither zoom, blast,
flash, or explode.<P>

When, since the days of the <I>Untouchables</I> , have we seen such exciting
wholesale slaughter on our livingroom screens? And it happened during
the very season when the networks have been bragging that at last they
have censored physical conflict from the screen. The full extent of the
ramifications of a successful <I>Galactica</I> on TV programming is yet to be
seen -- but it will certainly be interesting to watch.<P>
