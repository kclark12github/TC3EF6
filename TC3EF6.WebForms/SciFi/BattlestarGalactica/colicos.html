<H1>John Colicos -- The Quintessential Klingon</H1>

<B>Whether human quisling or alien commander, this actor finds
arch-villainy simply heavenly</B><P>

by Peter Bloch-Hansen<P>

"Villains, like blondes, have more fun," says veteran actor John
Colicos, who should know. Colicos created two of science-fiction
television's most famous villains: <I>Star Trek's</I> Klingon Commander Kor
and the human traitor Baltar on <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>. But besides
those disreputable notables, he has played countless other "villains of
the week" on such shows as <I>Mission: Impossible</I>, <I>Hawaii Five-O</I>,
<I>Night Heat</I>, <I>Mannix</I> and <I>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</I>. Reflects
Colicos, "I think I've been on just about every crime or adventure drama
there is."<P>

--<P>

However, it is <I>not</I> as Kor that Colicos is mainly recognized by SF
fans, but as Baltar. "I can't go <I>anywhere</I>!" he exclaims. "People are
screaming out of taxis, 'Hey, Baltar!' It's the curse of the Cylons!
About four or five years ago, we were doing <I>The Dresser</I> out in
Edmonton [Canada] to a school audience who were magnificent, great
applause at the end. I put up my hand and they went deader than a
doornail. 'I just want to tell you,' I said, 'that I think you've been
the best audience we've had.' We started applauding them, and some kid
screamed out, 'Baltar lives!' It brought the house down.<P>

"I have two young female fans in the Antelope Valley," Colicos explains.
"I have <I>no</I> idea how they tracked me down, but they keep sending me
stories with Baltar as the hero and lovely drawings. They've idealized
me terribly and taken 60 pounds off me."<P>

In the midst of remarking on the many pleasant experiences he has had
with fans, Colicos smiles merrily, remembering a Los Angeles SF
convention he once attended. "There was one kid who said, 'Mr. Colicos,
what does Baltar do when the chair turns around and we can't see him
anymore?' I was stumped for a second, then I said, 'Well, it's perfectly
obvious. He reads Marvel comics all day long.' That brought down the
house. Then, I thought, well, maybe he does. I mean, what else <I>does</I>
Baltar do?"<P>

Still, Baltar's part in the <I>Battlestar</I> epic was almost a very small
one. "Initially, I was <I>only</I> to be in the pilot," recalls Colicos.
"Then, Glen [Larson] decided he liked the character and he work that I
was doing, so he deiced to keep Baltar as a running character. He
re-directed the pilot's final scene himself, so that when the sword came
down to cut my head off, he stopped at the least second and I was spared
if I would betray the human race.<P>

"Had the show gone on longer, we had some marvelous ideas. Glen is a
Mormon, very imbued with the Bible. There are many biblical references
in <I>Battlestar</I> -- Adama, for instance, and the tombs of Kobol, the lost
tribes of Earth. All that is a kind of strange pastiche of events in the
Bible. We conceived Baltar as eventually being a sort of Lucifer,
basically a fallen son of God. He might have turned out eventually to be
a bastard son of Adama, or a brother -- the black sheep of the family,
as it were. In fact, I was the one who, at a luncheon in a Chinese
restaurant, brought up the idea."<P>

Colicos also claims credit for the design of Baltar's costume. "I was
<I>furious</I>," he comments, "about that sheet thing that I wrote in the
pilot, those diapers. That was ludicrous. That's why I designed the
green velvet and the hairpiece. It had the slight suggestion of horns to
it, so it was slightly satanic. Then, they decided to light me all from
beneath, to make me as grotesque as possible. There were all kinds of
directions considered."<P>

Once Baltar was established as a series regular and the episodes
unfolded, his character underwent considerable change. "What was
unfortunate," says Colicos, "was that we had different writers on every
episode and they hadn't come to grips with the storyline. They hadn't
quite decided what audience they were trying to reach, whether it was
cutesy kid audiences, or whether it was college-level science-fiction
fans, or the general populace. By not finding a full two-year storyline,
and having a bible to follow, the character of Baltar kept flipping back
and forth."<P>

Colicos himself isn't sure what motivates Baltar. "If it's a revenge
motive, then it's the classic 'Better to reign in Hell than serve in
Heaven.' It may be, as my Antelope Valley girls make out, Baltar was
framed. There's a third suggestion we toyed with, that it's all a ploy
to finally get rid of the Cylons. Baltar would turn out to be Adama's
spy. Take your pick. Because the writers never decided who and what he
was, we never found out. 'I've played villains,' I thought. 'I've played
monsters. We'll do a fine line and make it enigmatic.' When in doubt, be
enigmatic."<P>

On <I>Battlestar</I>, as on <I>Star Trek</I>, creative relationships for Colicos
were excellent. "Glen Larson was marvelous," he enthuses. "We had
wonderful lunches. He's a man who knows how to live and lives very well
indeed. He's highly intelligent and very creative -- millions of ideas
floating around in his head all the time. He's not closed-minded at all,
but open to all suggestions.<P>

"The fellow who played Lucifer was a sweet kid. He was marvelous, but he
had no voice at all. He was a tiny, little fellow, a dwarf, I think you
would say. He only came up to the middle of Lucifer. The top was a
harness that he wore. He was speaking out of the middle of the body,
while all this electronic madness was going on top, the eyeballs going
beep-beep-beep. They brought in Jonathan Harris [of <I>Lost in Space</I>] to
dub in Lucifer's voice later, but I never saw him.<P>

"Half the time when I was playing Baltar, the scene started when I would
whirl around in the chair, and there I would be, the regal lord, sitting
on top of the pedestal. But, I thought, 'I'm going crazy here. I'm
climbing this Leaning Tower of Pisa, on this rickety ladder.' The most
dangerous part of the whole performance was getting up 30 feet on that
ladder, with four stagehands hanging on. It was way the hell up in the
top of the ceiling. They shot all my stuff on a crane. What with 'By
your command' and all this, I finally got to the point where I thought
if I talked any more to bloody robots, I would go out of my mind.<P>

"When I finally did go to war on <I>Battlestar</I>," Colicos reveals, "and
wore the Cylon helmet, which had my face showing in there, instead of
mechanicals, I was nearly burned to death. The helmet had these lights
or something, over my forehead but I couldn't get it off, and I was
yelling for help, but they couldn't hear me. Finally, someone saw me
waving my arms around like a madman and realized something was wrong,
but it was a near thing."<P>

--<P>

A native Canadian, Colicos got his acting start in high school, when the
principal drafted him at short notice for the school play. When an
English teach introduced him to Shakespeare, he decided to become a
classical actor. "One of the first roles I ever played was God," he
laughs, "and I've been going downhill ever since."<P>

That "downhill" trip, has encompassed many stage roles, as well as
countless appearances on television and such feature films as <I>Anne of
the Thousand Days</I>, <I>Raid on Rommel</I>, <I>Scorpio</I> and the 1984 version of
<I>The Postman Always Rings Twice</I>. It also included a period with the
illustrious Old Vic Shakespearean Company in London, England, which he
joined in 1951. There, at age 23, Colicos becomes the youngest King Lear
on the English stage in this century. "To me, Shakespeare," he explains,
"is the greatest psychologist who was ever born. His knowledge of
humanity, from the highest to the lowers, is absolutely incredible."<P>

It was in his early years of stage and radio work in Canada, however,
that Colicos met the two actors with whom he would do his best known
work, William Shatner and Lorne Greene. "Lorne went to Hollywood,"
Colicos wryly observes, "learned how to ride a horse, became Pa
Cartwright and wound up playing God in <I>Battlestar</I>."<P>

Colicos has strong feelings about heroes and villains. "Leading men are
so cliched," he maintains. "They're so boring, so predictable. But when
you get a really kooky, off-beat villain, you can explore all kinds of
devious twistings and turnings in the human mind. If you're a hero,
well, they're all interchangeable. I don't think they're so interesting
as these basic characters, which are the mainstay of all the shows
anyway. People tend to remember the villains more than the heroes.
Everybody wants to hiss and boo. <I>Everybody</I> loves villains. It gives
them a sense of superiority because they can feel, "Well, I'm not as bad
as he is.'"<P>

On the other hand, Colicos believes that people tend to identify with
villains. "Deep down in their hears, they know they can <I>never</I> be
Superman or Clark Gable. It's much easier to deflect all that feeling
into the villains, who maybe get their comeuppance in the end, but get a
good run for their money. They're fighting the system, they're fighting
everything, and it's a great release valve for people."<P>

--<P>

However, Colicos still enjoys doing genre work. "When you do science
fiction," he notes, "then the imagination can run wild. All of these
films appeal to the childish imagination in everybody. <I>Battlestar</I> was
like playing games again, with mad costumes and ridiculous lines, being
the lord of the universe -- it was a <I>ball</I>. I love <I>Star Trek</I>, too.
I've got most of it on tape, as a matter of fact. I had fun on <I>Star
Trek</I> because I just literally walked from set to set following my
makeup around. I would love to do Baltar again. I would love to do Kor
again, and some day, before I die, I would like to play Ming the
Merciless." In fact, according to Colicos, there was a possibility that
Kor might have returned in <I>Star Trek II</I>, but the filmmakers opted for
Khan instead.<P>

Currently living in Toronto, Canada, Colicos is renovating a house to
make room for his many career artifacts and his 4,000-volume theatrical
research library. His latest feature is a supernatural thriller called
<I>Shadow Dancing</I>.<P>

"I've always remained a 19th century, slightly hammy, overblown actor,"
he insists. "I prefer gigantic parts with huge emotions to playing
kitchen drama. All this realism is just tedious and boring.<P>

"I'm too big for television now," John Colicos adds wryly. "I'm too big
for my <I>house</I>. I belong on another planet somewhere. I wish there were
a space shuttle going to Mars. I would take my Shakespeare and start a
new company... somewhere up there."<P>
