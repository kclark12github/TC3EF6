BATTLESTAR'S Maren Jensen<p>

Maren Jensen has been called a "Hollywood Cinderella." In a few
years, she went from a college student, selling shoes part-time, to
a full-time TV star!<p>

Before landing the part of Athena, she was a top fashion model,
too. Maren was born and raised, and still lives, in California. In
her spare time, she writes music, plays the piano, and roller
skates along the boardwalk.<p>

As for beauty tips, blue-eyed Maren says, "I always think positive.
I eat a balanced diet, too." (She's 5'7", 110 lbs.) Her only
complaint is that the "Battlestar" costumes are heavy and stiff.
"But," she says, "they look great." So does Maren Jensen!
