<H1>SALT-Galactica</H1>

<B>MOSCOW</B>, Jul. 8, 1979 (AP) -- The Soviet newspaper Izvestia says foes of
the SALT II arms limitation treaty are taking their fight to American
moviegoers through thinly veiled anti-Soviet innuendo in the
science-fiction spectacular <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>.<P>

The government newspaper charged over the weekend that the outer-space
epic -- as well as other U.S. films and TV shows -- was rife with hidden
ideological messages amounting to "propaganda of mass anti-Soviet
psychosis."<P>

"Their spirit is the spirit of the Cold War," wrote Melor Sturua, a
veteran U.S.-based correspondent for Izvestia who often reports on
American lifestyles and popular culture.<P>

Sturua said Hollywood movie companies were enmeshed in a tight web of
interests with big Wall Street banks and the U.S. military-industrial
complex.<P>

His vitriolic 2,400-word dispatch reflected the increasingly strident
tone the government-controlled Soviet press has been taking in recent
weeks toward American opponents of the SALT pact, signed last month in
Vienna.<P>

Debate on the strategic arms limitation accord is set to begin this week
in the Senate, where the treaty must win a two-thirds majority for
ratification.<P>

Sturua said that after a local movie review had piqued his curiosity
about <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>, he went to see it.<P>

While the film's cosmic struggle unfolds "everything around you rattles
and shakes," Sturua told Soviet readers.<P>

He said the matinee audience, mostly children, "withstood it very well.
I noticed only a couple of cases of hysteria, which ended in tears and
removal of the children from the hall."<P>

The movie's plot pits a united space civilization of humans against a
society of robot beings called the Cylon.<P>

"The galactical negotiations between the people and the Cylon really
resembled the U.S.-Soviet SALT talks -- not in their actual form, but in
the perverted interpretation of the enemies of the treaty from the
family of Washington hawks," Sturua wrote.<P>

"The crafty Cylons, similar to the 'crafty Soviets,' propose to the
president of the galactical union something like space detente," he
wrote.<P>

The galactical union's armed forces commander tries to warn that the
Cylon "don't want peace but only a pause to prepare a knockout blow that
they'll deliver as a first strike."<P>

Nonetheless, "the president categorically refused to believe his
commander and in spite of his warnings signs a pact with the Cylons,"
who subsequently launch a devastating surprise attack on the United
States of Galactica.<P>

Sturua conceded it was "just plain naive" to search for any direct
parallels with reality.<P>

But, "far more important," the Soviet correspondent wrote, "is the
spirit, the inspiration of films of the 'Battlestar Galactica' type.
Their inspiration is the pumping-up of military anti-Soviet hysteria,
which in this case is disguised in the modern costume of
socio-scientific fantasy."<P>

"The fact that modern American cinematography prefers Cold War is not
just a coincidence -- and the film 'Battlestar Galactica' isn't the only
example of (Hollywood's connection with Wall Street and the
military-industrial complex)," he wrote.<P>

He said the movie <I>Buck Rogers in the 25th Century</I> and television shows
including <I>The Bionic Woman</I> and <I>Six Million Dollar Man</I> also were
riddled with "anti-Soviet symbolism dressed in a transparent tunic of
science fiction."<P></BODY>
