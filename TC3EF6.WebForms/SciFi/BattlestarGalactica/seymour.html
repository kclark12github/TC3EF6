<H1>JANE SEYMOUR</H1>

<H3>It's a snap for this beautiful actress to move from the far-flung future
to "Somewhere in Time."</H3>

"Do you want to know the <I>real story</I> about my role in <I>Battlestar
Galactica</I>? ... First of all, that two-hour movie for TV was shot and
reshot, and in the end it no longer resembled the original script at
all. When I accepted the role I was handled a script in which my
character was similar in some ways in strength to Jane Fonda's character
in <I>The China Syndrome</I>. I was playing a news media reporter who was
announcing that everything was being destroyed. She went through traumas
there, trying to fight for the rights of the people who were surviving
and then realizing half-way through the film that she had the equivalent
of galactic cancer. None of this was shown in the final version. They
just turned into into a hardware kind of thing.<P>

"I had a wonderful role, and I played the whole thing like a woman who
was dying. Then they called up my agent (I had <I>died</I>, mind you, in the
film) and said they would like me to do the series. He said: 'Well, she
is not doing the series. I told you just one two-hour episode, and
that's it. Besides, her character is dead.' They said, 'Well, she's not
dead.' 'How can she not be dead?' he replied. 'She wandered around
looking sick through most of the movie. She was always seeing doctors
and talking about who she would leave child to.'<P>

"They assured us Serina hadn't died; so we went off to see the film. I
absolutely could not believe it. They had cut out every scene I had ever
talked in. They had all the other characters talking to me and saying
things. And they cut to moments when I wasn't looking so pained. My
character made no sense at all. I couldn't believe what they had done.
There were things happening to me that I had never seen.<P>

"They then said, 'Well, we just <I>have</I> to have her back. What will it
take to get her?' I was so angry, I said, 'More. More <I>deniro</I>.' I also
said that if I came back there had to be an interesting plot. They said,
'Oh yes, we will make it more fascinating... we have three days to do it
in.' They tried to do with me in the next two hours what they would have
liked to have done in two years."<P>

Seymour emphasizes that she never had any intentions of doing the
<I>Battlestar Galactica</I> series. "They conned me into doing the second two
hours because they completely ruined the characterization of the
character I was doing in the first. I have never been in a series. I
don't want to have to do what Christopher Reeve supposedly has to do to
cast over the <I>Superman</I> image. No one knows who I am."<P>

Actually, the last sentence has proven to be not absolutely true. While
visiting a friend in New York, the child of that friend stared and
started at her and finally said, "Serina."<P>

"And then," Seymour explains, "the little boy said, 'Oh, please kiss me
good-night.' His mother said, 'Please do.' So I went to kiss him good-
night, and the boy clung to me in absolute horror and said, 'Don't die,
Mommy. Don't die.' He totally identified with Boxey. I suddenly realized
there was an enormous public out there."<P>
