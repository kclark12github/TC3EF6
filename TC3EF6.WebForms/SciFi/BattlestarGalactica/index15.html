<h3>A bit of history.....</h3>
Before the machine was Battlestar Galactica it was called Evel Knievel.
It was made by Bally amusement machines in about 1977.
Then  it was gutted, leaving only the power transformer, tilt switches
and coin slot assemblies intact.
<h3>Construction.....</h3>
The playfield, backglass and paint job are all new to the machine.
Using old actuators, switches and targets from two old playfields, a new
playfield 
was constructed.
The scoreboard and ball counter are built from componet level up.
Due to a limited parts budget the game remains only one player.
It has stereo sound but at this time only beeps and buzzes.
The background noise is a electronically produced mimic of the Galactica's
engines.
<h3>Play features.....</h3>
After completing "TURBO LASER" the ball can be locked in "Laser Generator"
at
the top of the machine.     Also, the playfield now scores X10 and closes
the bottom gates at both sides.
The three round bumpers "cylon base stars" can score X10 for 1 min. after
completing
"SHIELD" below them.
Extra balls can be had if the player has the skill to hit the top left target
during the game.
Two balls can be played at one time if the "LAUNCH" target is hit when the
launch lite
is flashing.
   Best score - 4750000 (not an easy machine but not a hard one either)<p>
