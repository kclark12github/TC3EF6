<H1>International Campaign for the Revival of Battlestar Galactica</H1>

Sixteen years ago, Battlestar Galactica blazed across television screens in North America. It lasted one year, and produced 24 television hours, but in April 1979, it was cancelled. Alas, their journey was never to end. A year later, the short lived sequel series, Galactica 1980
followed with all new actors. It was very poorly received by Galactica fans and quickly disappeared from the small screen. In 1987, the show's star, Lorne Greene (Commander Adama) died. At that point, the idea of Galactica coming back, with its original cast to the small screen seemed farther than ever.<P>

And yet interest never really died. As early as 1991 there have been rumors of a Battlestar Galactica revival. And in October 1993, at last year's Battlestar Galactica 15th Yahren Reunion, producer Glen Larson announced that Fox television was interested in picking up the project, probably in the form of two two-hour movies. At the convention, the surviving cast members were all willing to participate in the proposed project. Richard Hatch (Apollo) has written a trilogy of scripts which would continue where the old series had left off.<P>

In the last twelve months since the convention, Fox's interest has cooled, but that could easily change with the start of a concerted campaign on the Internet.<P>

Fox television has recently let it known that it wants input on their shows on the Net, in particular, the Alien Nation revival, and The X-Files. There has never been a better time for Galactica fans. People who want a revival with the surviving original cast of the series, and who have waited 15 years for it! Fox has shown a willingness to revive once- dead properties in the form of the recent Alien Nation two-hour movie, and may make more, if given enough positive feedback. If people show enough interest, Fox could easily regain interest in Battlestar Galactica.<P>
