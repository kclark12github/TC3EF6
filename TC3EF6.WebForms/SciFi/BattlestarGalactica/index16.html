Version 1.0, March 1996<br>
Mark F. Heiman (mheiman@carleton.edu)<p>

This font was designed to closely resemble that used 
in the title credits of that classic of 70's SF TV, 
Battlestar Galactica. As far as I know, it's not available
commercially, but someone's bound to correct me.<p>

This release of the font contains a basic 
character set, excluding most of the international
characters (because of the peculiar layout of this font, as
explained below, there's a limit to the international
characters I can include). Any suggestions you may have for 
improving this font are welcome.<P>

One distinctive quality of the Galactica opening titles is
that some of the characters are connected to their 
neighbors. In order to support this behavior, I've had
to create multiple versions of most of the letters
and spread them across the available character slots.  The 
README file included with the font explains how to make
use of these extra characters.<p>

This font is freeware. You may copy and distribute it 
to your heart's content with no obligation whatsoever. 
 I designed it for my own personal use with no intention 
of profit.  Just don't claim it as your own work and 
we'll all be happy.<P>
