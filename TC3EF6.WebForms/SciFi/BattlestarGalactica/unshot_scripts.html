<H1>Unshot Battlestar Galactica Scripts</H1>
by Susan J. Paxton<P>

The following is a list of scripts that were written 
for Galactica, but for one reason or another were never 
shot. All except the last one, which I have never seen, 
plus differing versions of the premiere script, are 
available from several commercial sources.<P>

THE BETA PIRATES by Leslie Stevens, a two-hour screenplay 
dated 31 October, 1977. A look at the early form of 
the series; Apollo is Skyler, Boxey an orphan unrelated 
to anyone who Athena cares for. In this episode, Athena, 
Boxey, and Muffit are captured by pirates, sold at 
a slave auction, end up in a Cylon prison, and are 
finally rescued by Skyler, Starbuck, and a pirate with 
a heart of gold. Despite a number of obvious similarities 
to &quot;Star Wars,&quot; an entertaining script that 
should have been filmed and in fact might well have 
been a contender for one of the originally-intended 
two-hour specials that were to follow the premiere 
(Originally &quot;Galactica&quot; was conceived as 
a series of specials, not as a weekly one-hour show). 
One element from this script resurfaced in &quot;Gun 
on Ice Planet Zero;&quot; Boxey and Muffit stow away.<P>

CROSSFIRE by John Ireland, a one-hour screenplay dated 
November 1977 and originally titled &quot;The Nari 
of Sentinel 27.&quot; Apollo is still Skyler, the Cylons 
are reptiles, and Lyra is a Council member. Similar 
to but shorter than &quot;Gun on Ice Planet Zero;&quot; 
added to &quot;Gun&quot; were Dr. Ravashol, the convicts, 
Boxey and Muffit, and considerably better characterization; 
for those who compare &quot;Gun&quot; disparagingly 
to &quot;The Guns of Navarone,&quot; all I can say 
is, this is worse.<P>

FIRE IN SPACE by Michael Sloan, a two-hour screenplay 
dated 22 June 1978. <BR>
&quot;Fire in Space&quot; by Jim Carlson and Terrence 
McDonnell was rather broadly based on this script, 
which opens with Apollo, Starbuck, and Boomer undercover 
in a bar seeking information on the Cylon pursuit. 
Later, Starbuck is charged with murdering the husband 
of a woman he's been involved with, the Cylons, thanks 
to a new project codenamed &quot;The Delta Factor,&quot; 
locate, attack and ram the Galactica, Apollo must lead 
a dangerous mission to obtain laser power packs for 
his father's surgery, aided by Starbuck dumping fire 
extinguishent on the fire with a viper, the true murderer 
tries to kill Boxey, who is a witness to the crime, 
but is foiled by Apollo, and of course everything works 
out in the end. Generally a very good script that should 
have been shot as is. Evidently Larson liked the basic 
ideas enough to recycle them; Jim Carlson and Terrence 
McDonnell, who wrote &quot;Fire in Space&quot; never 
saw the script but were given the basic plot Larson 
wanted followed and wrote under his direction. &quot;Murder 
on the Rising Star,&quot; which is only superficially 
similar, was an original idea by Carlson and McDonnell 
but credit for &quot;based on a story by&quot; was 
given to Sloan for legal reasons since he had previously 
submitted a script with a murder in it. <P>

SHOWDOWN by Frank Abatemarco, a one-hour screenplay 
dated 5 July, 31 July, 3 August, and 15 August 1978. 
Renegade hangar crewmen steal a shuttle and three land 
probes, the flying motorcycles of G80, built for this 
evidently very nearly filmed episode, and terrorize 
a settlement on a recently-discovered planet before 
Apollo and Starbuck stop them. Like most of the early, 
unfilmed scripts, features Athena prominently. <P>

THE MUTINY by Guy Magar, a one-hour screenplay dated 
2 October 1978. Fairly silly script in which everyone 
decides they're tired of the journey and desert the 
Galactica and the fleet to settle a habitable planet. 
Naturally the Cylons arrive just in time to cure the 
Colonials of their delusion. <P>

I HAVE SEEN EARTH by Steve Kreinberg and Andy Guerdat, 
a one-hour screenplay dated 26 October 1978, revised 
3 November 1978. Concerns a prospector who has to abandon 
an asteroid with a solid gold core when the Cylons 
arrive; he claims to have been to Earth and endears 
Boxey to him with his colorful tales. Everyone doubts 
his veracity, but in the end he gives Boxey a medallion 
with Earth's continents engraved on it. The version 
available in fandom is evidently that rewritten by 
Jim Carlson and Terrence McDonnell; this is the only 
one of the early, unshot scripts they saw when they 
joined as story editors. Their version was apparently 
being considered for a second-season script.<P>

TWO FOR TWILLY by Jim Carlson and Terrence McDonnell, 
a one-hour screenplay dated 22 December 1978. According 
to Anne Lockhart, it was nearly filmed_the script was 
passed out, then withdrawn. A soap opera concerning 
a friend of Starbuck and Apollo who has wives all over 
the fleet, the basic idea, according to Carlson and 
McDonnell, came from a 50s Alec Guinness film, &quot;Captain's 
Paradise.&quot;<P>

FINAL FLIGHT/RETURN OF STARBUCK by Glen A. Larson. Its 
original title and dates are unknown (&quot;Final Flight&quot; 
is from a rumor, so may not be definitive), but according 
to Stu Phillips and Richard Hatch, this G80 episode 
was based on a second-season BG script. In the original 
version, Starbuck was shot down on a deserted planet, 
reconstructed Cy for company, and met up with a woman 
who had landed on the planet after fleeing from some 
sort of trouble. <BR>
Starbuck selflessly sent her back to her world in the 
escape craft he and Cy had made, and was fortunately 
rescued himself by Boomer. Guesswork suggests that 
only the Starbuck/Cy dialogue in the G80 version is 
a direct survivor of the original.<P>
