<H2><A NAME="G1">G1.   What is Battlestar Galactica?</A></H2>

<I>Battlestar Galactica</I> premiered on the ABC television network in
September 1978. It was one of the most spectacular shows ever produced
for television, and despite its relatively short life, today it has an
active fandom, and can still be seen on television stations and video
stores around the world.<P>

<I>Battlestar Galactica</I> was the brainchild of <A HREF="#C1">Glen A. Larson</A>, and evolved
from an earlier project called <I>Adam's Ark</I>. Larson had pitched the show
in the late 60's, the same time that the original <I>Star Trek</I> was in its
death throes, but the project was put on the backburner. In the
intervening years, Larson worked on many popular television programs,
including <I>It Takes a Thief</I>, and <I>McCloud</I>. It wasn't until <I>Star Wars</I>
hit movie theaters in 1977 that Larson's pet project became something
viable.<P>

Larson once remarked in <I>Science Fantasy Film Classics</I> (October 1978):

   <BLOCKQUOTE><I>Adam's Ark</I> was sort of about the origins of mankind in the
   universe, taking some of the biblical stories and moving them off
   into space as if by the time we get them to Earth, they're really not
   about things that happened here, but things that might have happened
   someplace else in space. It was influenced by Von D&auml;niken's <I>Chariots
   of the Gods</I> and some of those things... <I>Adam's Ark</I> helped bring a
   focus into what my concept had been. Ultimately, <I>Battlestar
   Galactica</I> is my original idea refined down to where I now have fixed
   on what my point of view is on how all humans throughout the galaxy
   probably evolved from some mother colony.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Galactica</I> has often been described as the <I>Star Wars</I> of the small
screen. Several <I>Star Wars</I> graduates worked on <I>Galactica</I>, including
<A HREF="#C2">John Dykstra</A>'s special effects, and Ralph McQuarrie and Joe Johnston,
who worked on the initial designs.<P>

<DL><DT>The cast of television's new "<I>Wagon Train</I> to the stars" was led by
Lorne Greene, best known as patriarch Pa Cartright of <I>Bonanza</I>. An
important component in the series is Supervising Producer Leslie Stevens
(<I>The Outer Limits</I>), who also produced Glen Larson's <I>Buck Rogers of
the 25th Century</I> for NBC. For information on the latter, view the <I>Buck
Rogers</I> web page at:<DD><A HREF=
   "http://www.kfs.org/~jpetry/br25c/brabout.html">
   http://www.kfs.org/~jpetry/br25c/brabout.html</A></DL>

Special costumes from Jean-Pierre Dorleac contributed to the unique look
and feel of the <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> universe, as did the stirring
musical score and theme from Stu Phillips and the Los Angeles
Philharmonic. The <I>Galactica</I> theme was cowritten with Glen Larson,
former member of <I>The Four Preps</I>. <I>Galactica</I>'s costumes, names and
themes were influenced by classical sources -- Egyptian, Phoenician,
Hebrew -- plus some more modern ones (Von D&auml;niken, Larson's own
background as a Mormon.)<P>

Initially planned as a series of telemovies consisting of a three-hour
premiere and two two-hour movies, ABC executives upgraded the project to
a full television series, after viewing the first half hour. The deal
was signed several weeks before the <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> pilot
appeared as a two-hour theatrical release in Canada, Europe and Japan.<P>

Universal purchased 80 prints of film to run across Canada, and ran in
more theaters than big films like <I>Jaws</I>, which had between 50 and 60
prints of film. Opening on July 7, 1978, the theatrical release did very
well, a typical run lasting six weeks. Universal's agressive marketing
and Galactica's appeal paid off, in this and subsequent theatrical
releases, as Leslie Stevens remarked in <I>Starlog #21</I> (April 1979):

   <BLOCKQUOTE>From the very beginning, we smelled that <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> could
   be a fine shot at a corner of the <I>Star Wars</I> market. And we were
   right. In theatrical release, <I>Galactica</I> beat out <I>Grease</I> and <I>Jaws
   II</I> in Japan and Canada. And it has been shown theatrically in this
   country [the United States] in a few test locations -- <I>after</I> being
   shown on TV -- and it did very good business.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Impressed by the profits generated by <I>Galactica</I>'s theatrical releases,
on March 29, 1979, Universal released the <I>Buck Rogers</I> pilot
theatrically in the United States. Opening in more theaters than <I>Jaws</I>
and <I>The Sting</I>, <I>Buck Rogers</I> grossed over $20 million in the first
seven weeks of its release. At this point, on May 18, Universal released
the <I>Galactica</I> premiere theatrically in some 400 theaters across the
United States. Glen Larson's two television pilots have broken the
unwritten rule that television pilots do not translate well to the big
screen.<P>

The three-hour pilot episode premiered on ABC on September 17, 1978, and
audiences were treated to several scenes not seen in the theatrical
releases. For the next eight months, 17 original episodes of the series
appeared, consisting of 24 television hours. These include the
three-hour television pilot, 4 two-part episodes, 1 two-hour special,
and 11 one-hour episodes. <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> was canceled in April
1979, its last episode "The Hand of God" making its appearance on April
29 of that month.<P>

Even after canceling the series, ABC continued to air <I>Battlestar
Galactica</I> reruns between June and August 5. As early as May, two weeks
after canceling the show, the network asked Larson for a two-hour movie
where the <I>Galactica</I> discovers Earth, the project that eventually
evolved into <I>Galactica 1980</I>.<P>

[<A HREF="#G">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H2><A NAME="G3">G3.   Which Battlestar Galactica episodes are available on home video?</A></H2>

The premiere episode ("Saga of a Star World") is available as a full
length movie, <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>. Based on the US theatrical release
of May 1979, it is 2h03m long, although the VHS box indicates it is
2h05m. This is the length of the pilot on all VHS and Beta versions, and
almost all laserdiscs. On one occasion MCA/Universal has solicited an
expanded version of the pilot, for in 1990 a flyer at Suncoast Video
advertised a 2h15 version. However, no such expanded version has ever
reached the marketplace.<P>

There is a Japanese version of the laserdisc which claims to be longer
(it may be 2h20m.) It is the same as the above versions, but with the
film speed of the 2h03m version slowed down to fit the larger timeframe.
The reader is urged to avoid this version at all costs, and focus on
untampered domestic laserdisc.<P>

<I>Galactica</I>'s theatrical releases, both Canadian and U.S., are missing
several scenes in the ABC version of the pilot. The ABC version of the
pilot is some 8 minutes longer than its home video counterpart, through
a combination of 11 additional scenes and 15 shortened scenes that are
only shown complete in the home video. The eleven scenes add about 16
minutes of new material to the pilot. However, because of the shortened
sequences, the ABC version cannot be called a "complete" version of the
pilot. For a more complete discussion of the pilot differences, the
reader is strongly urged to read the separate document, <A HREF="BGDIFF2.HTML">The Different
Versions of the Battlestar Galactica Pilot</A>.<P>

Currently, only 8 of the 11 one-hour episodes are available from
MCA/Universal home video, each 47 minutes. These include "The Lost
Warrior", "The Long Patrol", "The Magnificent Warriors", "The Young
Lords", "Fire in Space", "The Man with Nine Lives", "Murder on the
Rising Star", and "Baltar's Escape". None of the two-hour episodes are
available.<P>

Other episodes appear in some format as full length movies. <I>Mission
Galactica: The Cylon Attack</I> (1h36) is an edited version of "The Living
Legend" and "Fire in Space". "Conquest of the Earth" (1h39) is an edited
version of <I>Galactica 1980</I>'s premiere and the two-hour "The Night the
Cylons Landed", along with stock footage from the original <I>Galactica</I>
series. <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> (47 min., StarMaker/Universal) is an
economy priced edition of <I>Galactica 1980</I>'s "The Return of Starbuck"
(no longer available.)<P>

Video chains such as Suncoast Video regularly keep all the above in
stock. Currently, only the pilot is available on laserdisc. In addition,
Columbia Home video also apparently carries <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> home
videos (US only.) Call 1-800-544-4431 for more details. Hopefully,
MCA/Universal will release the entire series on video soon.<P>

<DL><DT>The above videos can be purchased online at <I>Video Express</I> at the
following addresses:<DD><A HREF="http://www.videoexpess.com/bin/webmain">

The best copies of the episodes, other than those originally aired, are
contained in the syndicated package aired on several television
stations, consisting of 24 one-hour episodes. With the exception of
"Greetings from Earth" (which is missing three minutes) and the pilot
(divided into three parts), the syndicated versions of the episodes are
identical to those shown on ABC's first run in 1978/79. [Note, the
syndicated episodes shown on <I>The Sci-Fi Channel</I> have had five minutes
cut per episode].<P>

Quality syndicated copies of the episodes (including a restored
"Greetings from Earth", with the missing 3 minutes edited in), and the
original ABC pilot, and can be obtained by writing to Brad Beaupain
(<TT><A HREF="mailto:beaupain@aol.com">beaupain@aol.com</A></TT>). Other items of interest also include the "Experiment
in Terra" telemovie, which contains material not seen in the regular
series or "The Return of Starbuck"[see <A HREF="#G4">G4</A>].

As well, Mark Koldys (<TT><A HREF=
"mailto:ar971@freenet.carleton.ca">ar971@freenet.carleton.ca</A></TT>) has put together his
own "director's cut" of the pilot, assembled from the various versions
(home video, ABC, syndicated.) For more information, send an e-mail to
their addresses. One can also write to Star*Tech for their video catalog
[see <A HREF="#P2">P2</A>].<P>

[<A HREF="#G">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H2><A NAME="G4">G4.   What are the Battlestar Galactica telemovies?</A></H2>

After <I>Galactica</I>'s demise on television, Universal cut the entire first
season into twelve two-hour "telemovies", to be sold to television
stations for syndication. All the material first appeared on the
original run of <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>, with the exception of the
"Experient in Terra" telemovie.<P>

This telemovie features an astronaut finding Commander Adama's log book
in space, and a short pre-Carillon synopsis of the pilot, with
narrations by Patrick Macnee and Lorne Greene (reciting from the log
book.) This is followed by more stock footage and a special edited
version of "The Return of Starbuck". This version of the <I>Galactica
1980</I> episode has had all the scenes and references to Angela and her
star child removed, and is made to appear as if Starbuck took the
part-Cylon part-Galactican escape craft back to the <I>Battlestar
Galactica</I>. This sequence is then followed by the episode "Experiment in
Terra".<P>

[<A HREF="#G">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H2><A NAME="G5">G5.   How much did Battlestar Galactica cost?</A></H2>

There are conflicting numbers for the initial costs of the show. The
<I>Galactica</I> office had announced that the first seven hours (the
premiere, "Lost Planet of the Gods", and "Gun on Ice Planet Zero") had a
$7 million budget, but some sources put the actual cost at $9 million.
Canadian publicity even claimed that the project was $14 million in the
making. In its first seven hours, <I>Galactica</I> worked out to $1 million
per episode, though, in an interview in <I>Fantastic Films #5</I> (February
1979), Glen Larson estimated the true cost was closer to $750,000 per
episode, the price ABC paid for each hour. No matter what the numbers,
<I>Galactica</I> is one of the most expensive shows ever to appear on the
small screen.<P>

The <I>Galactica</I> bridge was estimated at $850,000. The computer hardware
giant Tektronix donated $3 million worth of high tech computer hardware
to dress up the set. Television monitors totaling $35,000 were used. The
six-foot long model of the <I>Galactica</I>, which weighed 60 pounds, cost
$50,000. In 1990, this model was restored for the purpose of a
<I>Battlestar Galactica</I> display at Universal Studios Florida, in Orlando.
35 Cylon Centurion costumes, at $3,400 a piece, were created.<P>

Some of the costs are very visible in the episodes themselves, including
"Lost Planet of the Gods", part of which was shot on location with
doubles at the Egyptian ruins at Luxor. In many ways, the special
effects (especially in the premiere) surpass those of <I>Star Wars</I>.<P>

[<A HREF="#G">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H2><A NAME="G6">G6.   Whatever happened to the lawsuits regarding BSG?</A></H2>

In June 1978, 20th Century Fox, later joined by Lucasfilm Ltd., sued
Universal Studios for copyright infringement of its <I>Star Wars</I> movie,
citing 34 similarities between the two films.<P>

Prior to the lawsuit, Fox had leased its soundstage and John Dysktra's
special effects personnel to Universal. The agreement was beneficial to
both parties, for Dykstra's <I>Industrial Light and Magic</I>, later renamed
<I>Apogee</I>, was not working on any projects at the moment, so leasing the
personnel and sound stages was beneficial to both parties. To not
infringe on the prerogatives of <I>Star Wars</I>, Glen Larson had an
agreement with <I>Star Wars</I> producer Gary Kurtz not to do several things
in the <I>Galactica</I> series, including laser streaks coming out of the
pistols.<P>

According to <I>Skywalking: The Life and Films of George Lucas</I>, 20th
Century Fox initiated the first lawsuit at the urging of <I>Star Wars</I>
creator George Lucas. One possible reason for the lawsuit was
Universal's decision to release the premiere theatrically in Canada, the
same summer 20th Century Fox had planned to rerelease <I>Star Wars</I>.<P>

Universal countersued, claiming that R2D2 was based on the Huey, Duey
and Louis robots in its 1973 release, <I>Silent Running</I> (Universal lost
the countersuit in 1980.) In response, Fox filed a suit attempting to
prevent marketing of <I>Galactica</I> toys and merchandise. Universal
countersued, asking Fox for damages because of a violation of the
California business and professional code. The lawsuit that started it
all was decided on August 22, 1980, when Los Angeles Federal court judge
Irving Hill ruled in Universal's favor, stating that the two films were
very different when viewed as a whole. Glen Larson commented on the
differences between the two in <I>Science Fantasy Film Classics</I> (October
1978):

   <BLOCKQUOTE><I>Battlestar Galactica</I> is <I>quite</I> different. When it comes to who are
   our characters and what our story is, I would have to say that if you
   were trying to compare <I>Shane</I> to <I>Gunfight at the OK Corral</I>, you'd
   say, "Yes, they're both westerns," but I doubt if you'd find many
   parallels beyond that.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The second unrelated lawsuit concerns the December 31, 1978 death of a
four year old boy in Atlanta after the misuse of one of the <I>Galactica</I>
toys. The child aimed a Colonial Viper toy into his mouth and launched
one of the projectile missiles, inadvertently choking himself to death.
On January 11, Mattel issued a recall order for the Viper and three
other vehicles. It also issued a missile mail-in for those who had had
already purchased a missile-firing version of the toys. In exchange for
the little red missiles, Mattel provided a <I>Hot Wheels</I> toys, "for the
loss in play value." Mattel redesigned the vehicle line to have non-
firing missiles.<P>

The boy's death triggered a national outcry to remove projectiles from
all toys. On March 23, the boy's parents sued Mattel. The judge
presiding over the case singled out <I>Star Wars</I> space toys as the
culprit (which upset Lucas very much.)<P>

The controversy had an impact on Kenner's <I>Star Wars</I>' toy line, as it
delayed the shipment of its Boba Fett dolls. The action figure -- whose
character would star in <I>The Empire Strikes Back</I> sequel -- was part of
a mailaway offer on the backs of other <I>Star Wars</I> figurines. Although
Boba Fett's original design and promotion included a rocket-firing
backpack, this mechanism was removed from its design. No rocket-firing
Boba Fett's ever rolled off the line, and only a handful of the
unpainted prototypes exist.<P>

<H2><A NAME="G7">G7.   Why was Battlestar Galactica canceled?</A></H2>

On April 29, 1979, ABC aired "The Hand of God". It would be
<I>Galactica</I>'s last original episode, for the network had just canceled
the series. No longer riding the initial momentum of the premiere, ABC
felt <I>Galactica</I> wasn't getting high enough ratings for the investment
they put in the show, and believed it could maintain or exceed its
ratings in a show with a much lower investment value. ABC's assumptions
were wrong, for when it moved <I>Mork and Mindy</I>, into the same time slot
(Sunday, 8PM EST), it got even lower ratings than <I>Galactica</I> did. The
network realized it made a mistake, but by then it was too late. In a
controversial article in <I><A HREF=
"ff.html">Fantastic Films #29</A></I>, the author claimed that
<I>Galactica</I> was actually a ratings success, and that ABC exaggerated its
ratings loss to kill a series it viewed as too expensive.<P>

In his book, <I>Confessions of the Kamikaze Cowboy</I> (pg. 139), Dirk
("Starbuck") Benedict relates the thinking behind <I>Galactica</I>'s
cancelation:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>For whatever reasons... <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> failed to live up to
   its blockbuster beginning. The ratings sagged and finally settled at
   a level that would have been sufficient for the continuation of any
   other show. But not for a project that had <I>numero uno</I> written all
   over it by everyone months before it went on the air. Anything but
   the top was too near the bottom and not good enough.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Glen Larson described elaborated on <I>Galactica</I>'s cancelation and its
Sunday time slot in <I>Starlog #36</I>:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>When you put the most popular show on the network [Mork and Mindy]
   there and [ABC] has to move it out, it proves the problem... was in
   the time slot, not us...<P>

   The original <I>Galactica</I>, I think, started off just right. It's like
   an airplane that takes off from an aircraft carrier -- it sort of
   dips before it really gets going. <I>Galactica</I> by its sheer weight and
   expectations, took a natural dip as it left the carrier deck. Then I
   think it started to climb. We did better stories and concentrated
   more on the characters...<P>

   [<I>Galactica</I>] had either the good fortune or the bad fortune to be on
   the most successful schedule in the history of television. In the ABC
   schedule last year, literally every show was in the 40's. That was
   just phenomenal. <I>Galactica</I> was canceled with a position of 24th in
   the top 100 shows, according to Cashbox's annual sweepstakes lineup.
   We happened to be on a network that misinterpreted how competitive,
   how tough the eight o'clock time slot was on Sunday night.</BLOCKQUOTE>

[<A HREF="#G">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H2><A NAME="G8">G8.   What is Galactica 1980?</A></H2>

The cancelation of <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> produced a flurry of letters,
phone calls, and even a sit-in at a local ABC affiliate by young fans.
Two weeks after ABC pulled the plug in April 1979, the network
compromised.and ordered the production of a two-hour movie to be filmed
in the fall, where the <I>Galactica</I> discovers Earth. This project evolved
into the three-part <I>Galactica 1980</I> premiere of the same name, which
aired on ABC between January 27 and February 10, 1980.<P>

One of the earliest names associated with the project was the renowned
science fiction writer Isaac Asimov. Just prior to <I>Galactica</I>'s
cancelation, Asimov had agreed to work as an advisor on a story bible
for <I>Galactica</I>'s second season (which would never be.) In an interview
in <I>Epi-Log Journal #14</I> (Spring 1994), Glen Larson explained Asimov's
association with <I>Galactica 1980</I>:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>In our talks with Asimov, we discussed a lot of ideas, and none of
   them had anything to do with discovering Earth. That was just sort of
   a hype that made it possible for us to get in business with ABC
   again. It was all to attract that young seven o'clock audience.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Adama reprised the role as commander, and Boomer is now Colonel, taking
over the role played by Tigh. The remainder of the cast was entirely
new, as most of the original crew were unavailable at the time of its
filming. In fact, the roles for Troy and Dillon were originally written
for Starbuck and Apollo. Xavier's role was originally written for Baltar
(as president of the Council of the Twelve!) Why did the <I>Galactica</I>
discover Earth? According to Larson, "we needed an event and certainly,
<I>Galactica</I> discovering Earth was an event that would bring people back
to the tube for a fresh sampling." (<I>Starlog #36</I>)<P>

Three factors, however, were stacked against <I>Galactica 1980</I>'s favor.
They were working with a whole new cast, at a vastly reduced budget, and
FCC regulations stipulated that the time slot (7 PM Sunday EST) was to
be set aside for younger audiences. Kent McCord ("Troy") discussed some
of these problems in <I>Starlog #162</I>:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>Universal and ABC felt it was too good an idea to let go. They really
   wanted to make it work, but they needed a way to economize, and so,
   when they came up with the idea for <I>Galactica 1980</I>, they decided to
   let us find Earth so they wouldn't have to spend much money on sets.
   Glen's idea was to do something along the lines of <I>The Day the Earth
   Stood Still</I>, in which Barry Van Dyke and I were these peacemakers
   who come to Earth with the knowledge and powers to create either a
   peaceful or warlike situation. I felt a show with that premise was
   really worth doing.<P>

   ABC jumped back into it and started demanding that we put kids in the
   show so that we could attract a young audience. I told anybody who
   would listen that we made Adam 12 in a way that kids picked up on it
   without having to do things to attract a kid audience. But the
   network wouldn't listen, and I felt, by the time it got to the point
   where we saw alien kids playing baseball ["Spaceball"], that much of
   the show's original premise had been stolen from us.</BLOCKQUOTE>

McCord and others believed that the response to the pilot had guaranteed
<I>Galactica 1980</I> as a regular series in the Fall 1980 lineup.  However,
ABC wanted the series rushed into production just three weeks after the
pilot episode aired. One <I>Galactica 1980</I> writer, who wished to remain
anonymous, remarked in <I>Starlog #37</I> (August, 1980):

   <BLOCKQUOTE>I have the greatest amount of respect for Glen Larson. The fact that
   <I>Galactica 1980</I> made it on the air <I>at all</I>  is a tribute to that
   man's dedication and hard work. He was up against incredible odds.
   The audience reaction to the three-hour <I>Galactica Finds Earth</I> movie
   was tremendous. And ABC made a wonderful decision -- do a series. But
   they wanted it in three weeks. There was no time for preproduction,
   which can mean <I>death</I> for a science fiction show.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The same writer revealed that during the filming of the episodes, one
would have seen scripts being written during filming, several episodes
being aired at the same time, scenes shot on Friday and Saturday to air
on Sunday, with production costs close to the original $1 million per
hour. As McCord recalls:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>There was one day that was just nuts. We were shooting on a
   soundstage with about 50 extras, and they came down at noon with
   eight pages of dialogue and told us we had to learn these pages and
   be on another soundstage at 4 PM to shoot scenes from another episode
   that had nothing to do with the scenes we had been shooting. It was a
   mess.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The anonymous writer believed, in spite of its problems, <I>Galactica
1980</I> was building a steady audience. He concluded:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>We needed more time to establish and define our characters, and to
   plan our next moves. Instead of canceling <I>Galactica</I>, I feel the
   network should have moved the show to a time slot where we could
   explore more mature themes and concepts. The series format was, and
   is, incredible. I don't think [viewers] have seen the last of
   <I>Galactica</I>. The <I>Galactica</I> universe has endless story possibilities
   -- like <I>Star Trek</I>.</BLOCKQUOTE>

In all, ten television hours of the show were produced -- consisting of
the three-part pilot, 2 two-part episodes, and 3 one-hour episodes . The
show's ratings were abysmal, and even a guest appearance by Starbuck in
the last episode couldn't save the series from extinction [see also
<A HREF="#E19">E19</A>].<P>

<H2><A NAME="G9">G9.   Will there be a Battlestar Galactica revival?</A></H2>

Three <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> scripts have already been written by
Richard Hatch (Apollo), who is very anxious to revive the series. One
script, "The Journey Home", was submitted to <I>The Sci-Fi Channel</I>, which
largely ignores <I>Galactica 1980</I> and continues where the series left
off. As Richard Hatch explains in <I>Not Of This Earth Special Edition #1</I>
(November 1993):

   <BLOCKQUOTE>It really deals with the journey of how they get to Earth and how
   they have evolved during this great time span in space. The story
   also introduces a second or third generation Cylon. The Cylons have
   evolved as a race into a far more lethal, for more dangerous
   opponent. As we all know, Commander Adama has passed away and I take
   it from that point. I really deal with those questions which have
   never been answered: what happened to Apollo, and what happened to
   Starbuck when he gets lost on that planet (which was part of
   <I>Galactica 1980</I>.)</BLOCKQUOTE>

At the <I>Galactica 15 Yahren Reunion</I> on October 13-15, 1993, in Los
Angeles, creator Glen Larson announced, "the Fox television network
would like to bring <I>Galactica</I> back. There is a good chance we will be
doing... something like a four hour movie that will reexamine the whole
saga of <I>Galactica</I> and its past, present, future." The surviving cast
members seemed more than willing to participate in a <I>Battlestar
Galactica</I> revival.<P>

In June 1994, the news on the proposed revival had somewhat soured, as
Mark Semich (<TT>mas@world.std.com</TT>) reported (see <A HREF=
"gopher://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk:70/0/public/media/tv/collections/tardis/us/sci-fi/BattlestarGalactica/digests/17">Battlestar Galactica
Digest #17</A>):

   <BLOCKQUOTE>I just got off the phone with <A HREF="mailto:hsiri1@aol.com">Dee Jay Driscoll</A>, organizer of the
   <I>Galactica 15 Yahren Reunion</I>... I asked if there was any further
   news about a new movie/series, and was told that Fox (who had been
   interested) recently told Glen Larson that they were now a little
   wary about doing it, as the convention had such a low turnout.<P>

   The con had been extensively advertised in <I>Starlog</I>, on <I>The Sci-Fi
   Channel</I>, and in many other places as well. Unfortunately, the Hilton
   (host of the con) had actually been telling people that there was <I>no
   convention</I>, that it had been canceled, and had been turning away
   fans <I>and guests</I> at the door and on the telephone... Apparently,
   there was some awards ceremony going on at the hotel, and middle
   management didn't want a bunch of skiffy fans around making things
   look bad.</BLOCKQUOTE>

In compensation for its role in the low turnout, the Hilton made a
public apology in <I>Starlog #205</I> (July 1995), and hosted <I>Con Rad</I>, a
mainstream science fiction on October 27-29, 1995, free of charge to the
organizers. Some of the guests at the <I>15 Yahren Reunion</I> were there.
However, there were no new announcements of a <I>Galactica</I> revival.<P>

At <I>Con Rad</I> it was reported that one <I>Galactica</I> cast member, John
Colicos, had a "hold" put on him, reserving him for an untold
<I>Battlestar Galactica</I> project. None of the other cast members have been
put on hold. Previously, at a science fiction convention in Maryland,
Vulkon '95 (March 11-12, 1995), Colicos revealed that somebody high up
at Universal was considering a <I>Galactica</I> animated series, and
approached him about reprising the voice for Baltar. This proposal, like
Fox's previous consideration of a revival, had never flowered.<P>

On the licensing front, <I>Galactica</I> has already made a comeback. In
August 1995, Rob Liefeld's Maximum Press released a <I>Battlestar
Galactica</I> line of comic books, featuring all new stories, including one
scripted by Richard Hatch. Trendmaster toys is set to release a new
series of <I>Galactica</I> toys in 1997. Dart Carts is set to release a 72
trading card set in late 1996.<P>

<DL><DT>Letters in support of a <I>Galactica</I> revival can be sent to several
sources. MCA/Universal can now be reached on the Internet, via the
following addresses:<DD><A HREF="http://www.mca.com/index.html">

Make sure all letters concerning a <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> revival
contain '<I>Battlestar Galactica</I>' or '<I>Galactica</I>' somewhere in the subject
header.<P>

Any revival of <I>Galactica</I> will be incomplete, however. One of the
principal stars, Lorne Greene (Adama), died in 1987. Other deceased
stars include Fred Astaire (Chameleon, Starbuck's father in "The Man
with Nine Lives"), who also died in 1987.<P>

<I>The Sci-Fi Channel</I> has been airing <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> since it
first went on the air in November, 1992. A staple in its weekday
programming, the SFC aired <I>Galactica</I> in rotation with Glen Larson's
other sci-fi counterpart, <I>Buck Rogers</I>. In October 1994, the SFC added
<I>Galactica 1980</I> to its roster.<P>

In December 1994, a <I>Sci-Fi Channel</I> representative sent the following
response to a query about Galactica: "Beginning the first week of 1996,
the 3-4pm time slot (Eastern Time) Mondays through Fridays will feature
a rotation between <I>Buck Rogers</I>, <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>, and <I>Galactica
1980</I> (shown in that order, so <I>Galactica</I> is scheduled to begin on
2/26.)"<P>

The SFC has had a big impact in reviving interest in <I>Battlestar
Galactica</I>. If your local cable operators do not carry it, contact them
and express your interest in it. Note, the syndicated packages aired by
the SFC have been edited to allow for more advertising time.<P>

   <BLOCKQUOTE>There are those who believe that life here began out there, far
   across the universe, with tribes of humans who may have been the
   forefathers of the Egyptians, or the Toltecs, or the Mayans. They may

From <I>The Official Battlestar Galactica Scrapbook</I> (pg. 14):

   <BLOCKQUOTE>The twelve human Colonies in space bore names that are easily
   recognizable on Earth... Caprica, Gemoni, Canceria, Piscon, Sagitara,
   Leo, Libra, Aquaria, Virgon, Aeriana, Taura, Scorpio -- all are

[<A HREF="#E">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H2><A NAME="E4">E4.   What is the lost thirteenth tribe? What is Kobol?</A></H2>

The legend of the "lost thirteenth tribe" (Earth), mirrors Earth's own
legend about the lost continent of Atlantis. Its history goes back to
the time when the original humans left Kobol to search out an
inhabitable system. As Adama once told the survivors before entering on
his quest:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>Our recorded history tells us we descended from a mother colony
   [Kobol], a race that went out into space to establish colonies. Those
   of us assembled here now represent the only known surviving
   Colonists, save one. A sister world, far out in the universe,
   remembered to us only through ancient writings... I wish I could tell
   you precisely where it is, but I can't. However, I also know that it
   is beyond our system, in a galaxy very much like our own, on a planet
   called... Earth.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The <I>Book of the Word</I> described the journey of the tribes of Man away
from Kobol.

   <BLOCKQUOTE>After their home planet Kobol was known to be doomed, the people set
   forth across a Great Void, which seemed to be endless until a bright
   shining star appeared as if from nowhere and guided them to safety.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Kobol itself was considered lost or a legend until its rediscovery in
"Lost Planet of the Gods", its demise attributed to both the variable
radiation of its sun or some ecological disaster. As one cut scene from
the original script elaborates:

   <DL><DD><B>Serina:</B>  Was it their fault their world died?
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   According to the log incredible waste was supposed to have
            occurred. The rivers and oceans were contaminated. The skies
            couldn't support even the heartiest of creatures.
   <DD><B>Serina:</B>  And when they settled the colonies, they turned on the
            technology that could have saved them. They destroyed their
            ships. It took them hundreds of yahrens to revive even the
            most primitive crafts.</DL>

After passing through the Void -- a seemingly endless magnetic sea --
the <I>Galactica</I>, guided by a bright star, rediscovered the lost planet
of Kobol. Adama believed that the secret passage to Earth was to be
found on that planet, buried in the tomb of the Ninth and last Lord of
Kobol. Adama explored his tomb among the remains of the lost city of
Eden. Inside these ruins, he explains:

   <DL><DD><B>Adama:</B>   (pointing to symbol) That refers to the Ninth Lord of Kobol.
            That is his seal. He was the last to rule here before the
            thirteen tribes migrated into the stars.
   <DD><B>Serina:</B>  Twelve to settle our colonies.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  So that's why you entered the Void! You think you can find
            some clue to where they went?
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   Yes.</DL>

Later on, inside the tomb of the Ninth Lord, Adama confronts Baltar and
explained his mission:

   <DL><DD><B>Adama:</B>   Our safety lies somewhere out there, along the path taken by
            the thirteenth tribe, the tribe that colonized the planet
            Earth.
   <DD><B>Baltar:</B>  Earth? You can't be serious. That's nothing but a fable.
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   I believe it is as real as the existence of the thirteenth
            tribe, and the key to that tribe lies here in this place
            locked away somewhere. I am certain of it.
   <DD><B>Baltar:</B>  Listen to reason, Adama. You could adrift forever in search
            of what -- a place that may be the myth of half-drunken star
            voyagers who came back to die here? We may all die here.</DL>

In several <I>Galactica</I> episodes, most notably "War of the Gods" and "The

<H2><A NAME="E7">E7.   What are the Cylons?</A></H2>

On Carillon in the premiere, Apollo explained the Cylons to Boxey:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>They're not like us. They're machines created by living creatures a
   long, long time ago... a race of reptiles called Cylons. After a
   while the Cylons discovered humans were the most practical form of
   creature in this system. So they copied our bodies, but they built
   them bigger and stronger than we are. And they can exchange parts so
   they can live forever... There are no more real Cylons. They died off
   thousands of yahrens ago, leaving behind a race of super-machines,
   but we still call them Cylons.</BLOCKQUOTE>

A dialogue between Count Iblis and the imprisoned Baltar in "War of the
Gods" suggests a more sinister theory behind the original Cylons demise,
that the biological Cylons made a pact with Count Iblis (the Devil.)

   <DL><DD><B>Baltar:</B>  I know you. I remember that voice... the voice of the Cylon
            Imperious Leader.
   <DD><B>Iblis:</B>   The Cylon is a machine.
   <DD><B>Baltar:</B>  Now. But once they were a race of beings who allowed
            themselves to be overcome by their own technology.
   <DD><B>Iblis:</B>   When did this happen?
   <DD><B>Baltar:</B>  A thousand yahrens ago, at the onset of the thousand yahren
            war with the humans.
   <DD><B>Iblis:</B>   And for my voice to be the voice of Imperious Leader, it
            would have to be transcribed to machine leader a thousand
            yahrens ago. I'd have to be a thousand yahrens old.</DL>

There are several kinds of Cylons seen in <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>:

<DL><DT><B>1. Imperious Leader</B>
   <DD>The leader of all the Cylons, Imperious Leader is the only Cylon who
   physically resembles the original biological Cylons.<P>

<DT><B>2. Cylon Centurions</B>
   <DD>A humanform Cylon warrior. Most Centurions have silver armor, though
   senior officers, such as Vulpa from "Gun on Ice Planet Zero", have
   golden armor.<P>

<DT><B>3. IL-series Cylons</B>
   <DD>Lucifer and Spectre are IL-series Cylons, and resemble walking light
   bulbs. These Cylons are more intelligent then Centurions, and have
   personalities. The current Imperious Leader is also an IL-series
   Cylon. The phrase is a play on words for John Dykstra's Industrial
   Light and Magic, which provided special effects for <I>Galactica</I>'s
   initial episodes.<P>

<DT><B>4. Civilian Cylons</B>
   <DD>The Cylon outpost on Gamoray in "The Living Legend -- Part 2",
   introduces for the first time several new types of Cylons, in
   addition to the first three.</DL>

<H2><A NAME="E8">E8.   Who is Count Iblis? What are the beings inside the Ship of Lights?</A></H2>

In a conversation with Apollo, Commander Adama suggested that Count
Iblis and the light entities are members of an advanced civilization. He
speculated that they could in some way have been responsible for the
original founding of Kobol.

   <DL><DD><B>Adama:</B>   The ancient ones, the Lords who first settled our Kobol,
            spoke of visitations from what they in their primitive way
            referred to as angels.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  Angels...
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   Think of them as custodians of the universe, advanced
            beings, very highly advanced, whose mandate it is to make
            certain that their powers are never abused by any one of
            their own.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  And they're watching him [Iblis], meaning he's one of them.
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   Or was.</DL>

Answering questions from Starbuck and Sheba aboard the Ship of Lights,
they revealed their nature and mission to him:

   <DL><DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Is that right? We're dead and you're angels?
   <DD><B>Entity:</B>  Oddly enough, there is some truth to your speculation.</DL>

And later on:

   <DL><DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Why are you doing all this?
   <DD><B>Entity:</B>  Because we fight a common foe, the forces of darkness and
            evil throughout the stars.
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      But why are you bothering with us? We are from a
            simple handful of human survivors.
   <DD><B>Entity:</B>  Because, as you are now, we once were. As we are now, you
            may become.
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Count Iblis, is he one of you?
   <DD><B>Entity:</B>  He now uses his powers to corrupt and lead others away from
            the truth.
   <DD><B>Sheba:</B>   Why can't you stop him?
   <DD><B>Entity:</B>  Because we cannot interfere with freedom of choice. His,
            yours, anyone's.</DL>

Even Count Iblis is bound by these laws. In a dialogue with Apollo,
Iblis revealed his true identity:

   <DL><DD><B>Apollo:</B>  You do not control no one who has not freely given you
            dominion. You have no power over me.
   <DD><B>Iblis:</B>   You know who I am.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  Yes, I finally know. Sheba, think back to the original
            records. The names Mephistopheles, Diabolis, the Prince of
            Darkness.</DL>

Members of this mysterious race include John ("Experiment in Terra") and
Angela (from <I>Galactica 1980</I>'s "The Return of Starbuck".)<P>

<H2><A NAME="E10">E10.  What are the standard Colonial units of measurement?</A></H2>

The relationships between Colonial units of measurements was never
clearly defined in the series. In most cases, only an appropriate table
of closest Earth measurements is provided, based on the usage of the
terms in the actual episodes.<P>

<H3>1. Time units and their closest Earth equivalents</H3>

<UL><LI>micron(s) - second
<LI>centon (sen'-tawn) - minute
<LI>centar, centares (sen'-tar, sen-tar'-ays) - hour
<LI>secton(s) (sek'-tawn) - week
<LI>sectar, sectares (sek'-tar, sek-tar'-ays) - month
<LI>yahren (yah'-rain) - year
<LI>millenium - 1000 years</UL>

Centon, micron and sectar also doubled as units of length, in much the
same way as the light year. The light yahren is the Colonial equivalent
of the light year. The quatron (week or month) was used in the episode
"Magnificent Warriors". Other nonstandard units were almost exclusively
used in the pilot, including millisenton (several minutes) and
microsenton (second), and the senton (day or week). Note, the senton in
the first two episodes is used in a different context than in the rest
of the series, hence its different spelling.<P>

represent, view the separate document <A HREF=

<H2><A NAME="E12">E12.  What happened to Baltar in the premiere? Didn't he die?</A></H2>

Prior to its premiere on ABC, the <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> pilot first
appeared in theatrical release in Canada and Europe. In the theatrical
version of the premiere, after Baltar betrayed humanity, he was beheaded
in front of Imperious Leader. The execution never took place in the
television premiere, as Baltar was spared for a later public execution
(never to take place.)<P>

In an interview in <I>Starlog #138</I>, John Colicos (Baltar), discussed the
evolution of the Baltar character between the two versions of the
premiere:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>Initially, I was <I>only</I> going to be in the pilot. Then, Glen [Larson]
   decided he liked the character and the work that I was doing, so he
   decided to keep Baltar as a running character. He redirected the
   pilot's final scene himself, so that when the sword came down to cut
   me head off, he stopped it at the last second and I was spared if I
   would betray the human race.</BLOCKQUOTE>

[<A HREF="#E">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H2><A NAME="E13">E13.  What happened to Baltar after he was trapped on Kobol?</A></H2>

In the episode "Lost Planet of the Gods", Baltar was last seen trapped
underneath fallen rubble on Kobol. In both the novelization and issue #6
of the Marvel comic, Lucifer rescued Baltar. He fully recovered and
there was no permanent damage, though he was sometimes seen with a
slight limp in later episodes.<P>

[<A HREF="#E">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H2><A NAME="E14">E14.  Did Commander Cain survive in "The Living Legend"?</A></H2>

Commander Cain was last seen taking on two Cylon basestars in "The
Living Legend". The ending of this episode was deliberately left
open-ended by its writers, in the hope that Cain would later return some
time in the second season.<P>

Here is one view of how Cain survived the assault, from Justin Collins
(<TT>jcollin6@mason1.gmu.edu</TT>) (see <A HREF=
"gopher://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk:70/0/public/media/tv/collections/tardis/us/sci-fi/BattlestarGalactica/digests/07">Battlestar Galactica Digest #7</A>):

   <BLOCKQUOTE>I always thought the <I>Pegasus</I> survived at the end of "The Living
   Legend". The <I>Pegasus</I> sustained considerable damage at the hands of
   the Cylon fighters before Baltar ordered them to break off the
   attack. However, when Starbuck and Apollo asked about the damage,
   Cain said she (the <I>Pegasus</I>) would be ready to do the job. By the
   time the <I>Pegasus</I> reached the basestars the fire was put out. Cain
   had also ordered the ship to proceed at "full speed" to intercept the
   basestars and for its electronic defense shields to be brought to
   "maximum power". Judging from the dialogue leading up to the final
   battle, I think the <I>Pegasus</I> was battle worthy by the time it
   reached the baseships.<P>

   Starbuck and Apollo inflicted considerable damage on the weapons
   systems of the two basestars before they could cause the <I>Pegasus</I>
   serious harm. Remember when they knocked out the flank missile
   launchers on both basestars?<P>

   I don't recall a chain reaction blowing up the second basestar. My
   copy of LL shows a close-up of the weapons panel on <I>Pegasus</I> bridge
   after the first basestar was destroyed, followed by a second volley
   of missiles being launched at the remaining basestar. I agree with
   Starbuck, Cain probably jumped to light speed and headed into deep
   space just like he did before.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="E15">E15.  What were the three tasks Iblis had to perform to become leader?</A></H2>

Count Iblis informed the Council of the Twelve in "War of the Gods":

   <BLOCKQUOTE>You have agreed on three tests of my strength. The first is to
   deliver your enemy [Baltar]. The second is to accurately plot your
   course to Earth. The third you cannot agree on. Some of you want to
   know who I am, where I come from. The others are satisfied to accept
   me because of my works and are willing to follow me blindly providing
   I guarantee your safety.</BLOCKQUOTE>

[<A HREF="#E">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H2><A NAME="E16">E16.  What was inside the wrecked ship in "War of the Gods</A></H2>

According to the original script and the novelization, the wreckage
belonged to Count Iblis' comrades. Here is the scene in the script, as
Apollo and Starbuck enter the wreckage.

   <DL><DD><B>Apollo:</B>  Everything is pretty well vaporized. Whatever hit this thing
            must have had the power of a sun.<P>

   Apollo stops dead in his tracks, looks down. He seems to shutter.<P>

   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  Starbuck!<P>

   Starbuck looks over and sees the sober look on Apollo's face. He
   moves over and looks down as Apollo begins to put on some tight
   fitting gloves. A piece of metallic surface, highly scorched but out
   of which protrudes a foot-like extremity, except that it's tip is
   clearly in the shape of a cloven hoof. Apollo and Starbuck exchange
   heavy looks. Apollo bends down and tries to life the metal. As they
   lift it off, tossing it aside, they grimace in horror. Under the
   wreckage is the figure of a devil, a demon.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The networks decided to drop the scene with the cloven hoof for two
reasons. The scene might be scary to younger audiences, and there were
religious implications behind the scene (i.e. "satanic".) For audience
members, the absence of the scene wrongly suggested that the warriors
had peered inside the wreckage of Commander Cain's <I>Battlestar Pegasus</I>.
As Count Iblis told Sheba, "Your father, you will see him again."<P>

[<A HREF="#E">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H2><A NAME="E17">E17.  What do the transmissions in "The Hand of God" mean?</A></H2>

In "The Hand of God", the <I>Galactica</I> picks up transmissions from the
Apollo moon landing in 1969. They came up with two possible theories on
the transmissions. The transmissions could have been a harmonic signal
from something close by, such as the local star system, possibly sent by
the Cylons. If not, the transmissions would have spent a longer time in
space, from a farther system.<P>

The <I>Galactica</I> sent out a Viper patrol to investigate the local system,
which passed by the first three planets. Starbuck investigated the third
planet, where he passed what looked like Earth's moon to find a dead
planet. Hiding behind that planet was a Cylon basestar.<P>

The Viper patrol found five planets in fairly widespread orbits. The
first planet was a giant, composed of 80% compressed hydrogen and 12%
helium. The second planet was almost entirely composed of compressed
carbon dioxide gas. The third planet had no atmosphere, just barren
rock. Contrasted to our own solar system, our first four planets are in
relatively close orbit, and Mercury, our first planet, is small, with
almost no atmosphere.<P>

The transmissions did not come from the local system, but from another,
whose time and distance from the <I>Galactica</I> is unknown. In short, it is
unknown therefore how near or far the <I>Galactica</I> was from Earth.<P>

[ Incidentally, there is an 11 year gap between the Apollo moon landing
and the time frame of <I>Galactica 1980</I>, yet the show itself is based on
the assumption that there is a 30 year gap between the discovery of
Earth and the destruction of the Colonies. ]<P>

[<A HREF="#E">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H2><A NAME="E18">E18.  Did the Galactica eventually find Earth?</A></H2>

In his interview in <I>Epi-Log Journal #14</I>, Glen Larson argued that the
events of <I>Galactica 1980</I>, including the discovery of Earth, could be
explained away and subsequently forgotten:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>If I have my way, <I>Galactica 1980</I> would certainly be Starbuck's
   nightmare, and we'd go back to the original concept. I guess if
   Dallas could turn a whole season into a dream we could make Starbuck
   wake up in the middle of the night after having had a nightmare about
   discovering Earth.</BLOCKQUOTE>

More likely, he argued, the series could be explained away as a computer
projection of what the discovery of Earth could be like if they're not
careful, not unlike the simulated Cylon attack sequence in the
<I>Galactica 1980</I> pilot.<P>

It should nevertheless be taken as given that the <I>Galactica</I> would
eventually find its destination. Earth's location was revealed to the
Galacticans in "War of the Gods":

   <BLOCKQUOTE>Earth -- quadrant alpha, 19 million sectars by Epsilon vector 22 on a
   circular reckoning course of 000 point 9 in a star system of nine
   plants and one sun.</BLOCKQUOTE>

If the transmissions of the Apollo moon landing in the "Hand of God" are
to have any meaning, it is that the <I>Galactica</I> was certainly on the
right track.<P>

[<A HREF="#E">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H2><A NAME="E19">E19.  What was the premise of Galactica 1980?</A></H2>

Officially, <I>Galactica 1980</I> was set 30 years after the events of
<I>Battlestar Galactica</I>. All the original cast members were either dead,
missing or never seen in <I>Galactica 1980</I>, with the exception of
Commander Adama and Boomer (now Colonel, replacing Tigh.) Captain Troy
(a grown up Boxey) and Lt. Dillon were second-rate copies of Apollo and
Starbuck. Other new characters include the teenage genius Dr. Zee, a
renegade Council member (Xavier), and a television reporter (Jamie
Hamilton.)<P>

In the three-hour premiere, "Galactica Discovers Earth", the <I>Galactica</I>
had at last found Earth (c. 1980). Unfortunate for Adama and company was
the discovery that the Cylons had been following them all across the
galaxy. The <I>Galactica</I> found Earth's technology was so backward that
colonization of Earth would be impossible, until Earth could raise it to
a level where it could defend itself against the Cylons.<P>

One plot element involved Galacticans contacting Earth's top scientists
to help Earth bring its technology up to the <I>Galactica</I>'s standards. An
additional time travel element involved Xavier, who traveled back in
time to help out Nazi Germany's rocket plan in his attempt to improve
Earth technology. These elements were generally ignored in the
short-lived series that followed.<P>

The remainder of the episodes were disappointing at best, hindered by
both its time slot and lower budget. Themes ranged from pollution ("The
Super Scouts") to racism ("Space Croppers"). Another storyline had
Cylons crashing in New York on Hallowe'en ("The Night the Cylons
Landed"), and even costarred Wolfman Jack. One of the ongoing storylines
had a group of super-powered children from the <I>Galactica</I> stranded on
Earth. Their "powers" were a result of Earth's lower gravity, and the
super-kids used them to their full extent to win a baseball game in
"Spaceball".<P>

The only memorable episode in the series was its final one ("The Return
of Starbuck"), which revealed the origin of Dr. Zee and his connection
with Starbuck.<P>

[<A HREF="#E">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H2><A NAME="E20">E20.  Wasn't Starbuck lost on some planet? What happened to him?</A></H2>

In <I>Galactica 1980</I>'s "The Return of Starbuck", the Dr. Zee character
has a dream sequence of Starbuck. Starbuck's ship is damaged in battle
and crashes on a desolate planet, along with the wreckage of a Cylon
raider. A need for company and his own survival instinct prompts
Starbuck to revive one of the Cylon centurions ("Cy", or Cyrus.)<P>

The show closely follows the plot of Barry Longyear's novella <I>Enemy
Mine</I>, as Starbuck and Cy are forced to help each other for mutual
survival. After Starbuck cheats at pyramids, Cy runs off, and later
returns with the body of a pregnant woman, Angela. In the course of the
show, Angela delivers her child (the future Dr. Zee), and Starbuck and
Cy put together parts from both the Raider and Viper to send the mother
and child (the future Dr. Zee) off to safety.<P>

At the end of the episode, another Cylon Raider lands on the planet, and
its three occupants start attacking Starbuck. Out of loyalty to his new
friend, Cyrus confronts and kills two Cylons, and in the process, he
himself is destroyed. Starbuck finishes off the third Cylon, and is once
again alone.<P>

Does Starbuck escape? On his own, probably not. In "The Hand of God", it
is revealed that Cylon raiders require a minimum of two pilots to ride
it. Unless Starbuck revives one of the Cylons (perhaps Cyrus), or
jury-rigs the Raider to run with one pilot, Starbuck will remain
stranded.<P>

[ One of the unfilmed scripts of <I>Galactica 1980</I>, "Wheels of Fire",
revolves around the idea that Starbuck, found "worthy" in this episode,
is rescued by Angela and the Ship of Lights (from "War of the Gods"),
and that he becomes an angel himself. ]<P>

<H2><A NAME="E21">E21.  Are there parallels between Battlestar Galactica and Mormonism?</A></H2>

Yes there are. Glen Larson (producer and creator) is a member of <I>The
Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints</I>, hereafter referred to as the
"Mormon" or Latter-day Saint (LDS) church. Some of the ideas in
<I>Galactica</I> are unmistakably Mormon in origin.

1.    In <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>, twelve tribes of man founded the Twelve
Colonies after departing from Kobol. A lost thirteenth colony colonized
Earth. In <I>The Book of Mormon</I>, around 600 BC, the prophet Lehi took a
remnant of the tribe of Joseph from Jerusalem to ancient America, during
the time of the Babylonian captivity and the scattering of the twelve
tribes of Israel.<P>

2.    In "Lost Planet of the Gods", it is revealed that the mankind
originated on Kobol, the mother world of all humans. Kobol is a
rearranging of the word Kolob, which is the star "nearest unto the
throne of God" (see <I>The Book of Abraham, Ch. 3</I>, found in <I>The Pearl of
Great Price</I>.) The "Star Kobol" was also the ship on which armistice
talks between the Colonials and the Cylons were held.<P>

3.    The episode "War of the Gods", with starred Count Iblis and the
Ship of Lights, introduces viewers to various elements of LDS teachings.
The universe is under the law of Free Agency: "We cannot interfere with
freedom of choice. His, yours, anyone's." Even Count Iblis (Satan) is
bound by these laws, for he has only control over those who had "freely
given him dominion." Those who accepted Iblis' words were willing to
follow him blindly provided he guaranteed their safety. According to the
Mormon account of creation (<I>The Book of Moses, Ch. 4</I>, found in <I>The
Pearl Of Great Price</I>), one of the reasons God cast Satan out of heaven
was because he "sought to destroy the agency of man."<P>

4.    The beings on the Ship of Lights are highly evolved brothers of
man, and may also have founded Kobol. The phrase "As you are now, we
once were; as we are now, you may become" is a rewording of a quote from
Lorenzo Snow: "As man is, God once was; as God is, man may become." This
is an important component of the doctrine of Eternal Progression.
According to LDS beliefs, all humans are children of God, who is Himself
an exalted man. By following God's laws, a believer can enter the path
to godhood.<P>

5.    In their sealing ceremony, Adama sealed Apollo and Serina with
these words: "A union between this man and this woman not only for now
but for all the eternities." In a Latter-day Saint temple marriage, a
couple is sealed for "time and all eternity."<P>

6.    There is a similarity in the political structures of the Colonies
and the Latter-day Saint church. Both bodies have a Council (or Quorum)
of the Twelve, and a President.<P>

7.    In the <I>Galactica 1980</I> episode "The Super Scouts", Dillon uses
the phrase "The glory of the universe is intelligence," a rewording of a
passage in <I>Doctrines and Covenants #93</I>: "The glory of God is
intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth." In Experiment in
Terra, aboard the Ship of Lights, the "angel" John tells Apollo "I have
no physical body, as you know it." Apollo, pointing to John's "body",
asks him "What do you call that?" "A reflection of intelligence. My
spirit, if you will."<P>

<H2><A NAME="E22">E22.  Is the expression "F*** Off" visible in the attack on Caprica?</A></H2>

From <I>Epi-Log Journal #14</I>:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>The words "Fuck Off" can be clearly seen spelled out in the lights of
   Caprica about thirty minutes into the [pilot] movie. Watch closely
   just after Serina's news broadcast is cut off by the sound of laser
   fire. The next scene shows four Cylon fighters swarming over the city
   and when the third fighter reaches the center of the TV screen, the
   offending words can be seen to its immediate right. They are even
   clearer in the <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> photonovel published by
   Berkley.</BLOCKQUOTE>
