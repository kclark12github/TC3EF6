VIPER for Windows is an arcade game that resembles the classic arcade game
"Defender".  Fly your Viper in defense of your fleet and EARTH.  You will
also be given the helm of a Cylon Raider for some missions (there was demand
to be the 'bad guys').<p>

Use your sensors on the bottom of the screen to determine exactly where the
Cylon or Colonial craft (depending on which role you are playing at the
time)are attacking, then INTERCEPT.<p>

You also have the opportunity to pilot the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and engage a
CYLON BASE STAR head on.<p>


After downloading, simply unzip the file in a directory of your choice.  Read
