<H2><A NAME="I">Introduction</A></H2>

The differences between the two major versions of the Battlestar
Galactica pilot have been the subject of much discussion over the years.
This document is a list attempting to catalogue all known differences
between the two major versions of the Battlestar Galactica pilot
episode.<P>

Over the years the pilot has been presented several times. Here are all
the known versions:<P>

<B>CV</B> - The Canadian theatrical version of the pilot in July 1978.
Universal released the pilot in theaters in Canada and Europe, to help
recoup the cost of making the show. In this version, and the USV, Baltar
is executed. In the article from <I>Future #6</I> (November 1978) described the
CV as "pared down a bit here, beefed up a bit there" from the network
pilot. Like the USV, it was also around two hours.<P>

<B>OV</B> - The original ABC version, featured on ABC television in September
17, 1978 and aired in three television hours. This is the first of two
major versions of the pilot discussed in this document. It has been
timed at about 2h17 without commercials. The only surviving versions are
second or third generation copies of the original broadcast, either on
VHS or Beta. One individual known to this writer has the actual film
reels. There are eleven new scenes presented in this version that are
absent in the HV, which form the basis for Section I.

There is at least one significant difference between this version and
the CV - the Cassiopeia/Starbuck love scene in the Viper launch tube. A
few weeks before her interview in <I>US Magazine</I> (October 17, 1978)
Laurette Spang received an urgent call to reshoot this scene with
Starbuck. In the CV, the pair were kissing in the launch tube, and
Starbuck had his shirt off. The remake, demanded by ABC, features a
fully clothed Starbuck, and this is the scene as shown here and in all
subsequent versions of the pilot. ABC also demanded a career change.
From the sexy "socialator", Cassiopeia became a med-tech (nurse) in the
rest of the series. "All of a sudden I'm dressed from head to toe.
Before that, my outfits were slashed almost to my hips, I had four-inch
heels and things wrapped around my legs, very sexy."<P>

<B>USV</B> - The US theatrical release of the pilot in May 1979. This is what
forms the basis for the home video, which is 2h03. Based on observations
of several scenes - including Baltar's death (<A HREF="#M4">#M4</A>), the reduced role of
Serina (<A HREF="#M1">#M1</A>), and Starbuck and Apollo's dialogue below Carillon (<A HREF= "#M10">#M10</A>) -
it is highly probable that the HV predates the OV, and may be identical
to the CV (aside from the launch tube love scene remake.) As Section II
of this document indicates, many scenes are available in their entirety
only in the HV, as they have undergone cuts of one kind or another in
other versions (OV, SV.) There are 15 such cuts in the OV, and an
unknown number of other cuts and dropped scenes in the SV and the SFC.<P>

<B>TMV</B> - Telemovie version. Incredible but true, the Galactica pilot,
originally over two hours in length minus commercials, was edited down
to 94 minutes, as part of Universal's second syndication pacakge,
featuring the Galactica series in twelve two-hour telemovies. This
version is not discussed at all in this document. The telemovies did not
circulate as well as their one-hour syndicated counterparts. Sold to
television stations in 1979.<P>

<B>SV</B> - The syndicated three-part version of the pilot. Universal
syndicated all 24 Galactica hours into syndication as one-hour shows.
This version is discussed only where it concerns the 11 "missing
scenes", most of which are complete in this version and the SFC. Also
discussed are where they are placed in the narrative. This is helpful if
one desires to splice together a director's cut based on intact missing
scenes in this version and the OV. Along with the SFC, the most widely
available television version of the pilot. Sold to television stations
around 1979/80, probably in tandem with the Buck Rogers syndicated
package (another Glen Larson production.)<P>

<B>HV</B> - The Home Video. This is the most widely available version of the
pilot, as VHS, Beta and a majority of laserdiscs. Based on the US
theatrical release from May 1979, and timed at 2h03, although the VHS
box label has 2h05 on the box. The video has remained in circulation
since the early 1980's.<P>

<B>SFC</B> - The Sci-Fi Channel version. The Sci-Fi Channel purchased the
rights to the 24 one-hour syndicated episodes, but edited them down in
order to air more commercials during the shows. Like the SV, this
version is only discussed where it concerns the 11 missing scenes and
their completeness. It is really a butchered version of the SV, but
perhaps the most widely available television version of the pilot.
Amazingly enough, 9 of the 11 missing scenes are all intact in this
version, notwithstanding cuts everywhere else. The Sci-Fi Channel first
went on the air around 1991, with Galactica as one of its star shows.<P>

<B>ELD</B> - The "evil" laserdisc. There is a Japanese laserdisc version of the
pilot that is about 2h20 or so minutes. It does not contain new footage,
and is actually the same version as the HV, but stretched to fit the
longer timespan. It is not discussed at all in this document.<P>

In all the versions of the movie, Galactica writer/producer Glen A.
Larson is credited as the writer and Richard Colla as director.
According to Science Fantasy Film Classics (October 1978), Colla 
directed the first two thirds of the pilot, the remainder having been 
directed by Alan Levi, who directed many other Galactica episodes.

Periodically discussed in this document is a copy of the script
(revision date May 8, 1978), and available from private collectors.<P>

This document is presented in three sections.<P>

<OL><LI>In the Missing Scenes section, is a title for all eleven missing
   scenes. Inside the parenthesis is the time of the segment in the OV.
   Where present, the second number represents the shortened version of
   the same scene in the HV. When each missing scene is inserted into
   the HV, it expands to about 2h20, or three minutes longer than the
   OV.<P>

<LI>In the Deleted Scenes section, is a title for each cut scene. Inside
   the parenthesis is the duration of that cut. In one case, the second
   number represents a replacement scene in the OV used to bridge two
   cut scenes and a misplaced scene. There are about three minutes worth
   of cut material, in over 15 separate scenes. The unedited versions of
   these scenes are in the HV.<P>

<LI>Finally, the last section deals with whatever could not be classified
   as either a deletion or a missing scene. These include dialogue
   inadvertently deleted from the HV soundtrack, untranslated Ovion
   dialogue in the OV, and the theme music played over the end credits.</OL>

<H2>I. Missing Scenes From The BSG Pilot Home Video</H2>

<H3><A NAME="M1">M1. The Warrior's Vacuum Tube (11s)</A></H3>

Adama calls battle stations. In crew quarters, Starbuck shovels his
cubit winnings down his pants as the alert is sounded. The lost scene
here is an eleven second segment of Starbuck and his fellow Colonial
warriors being trammed through a vacuum tube to their Vipers. Starbuck
is shown holding his helmet in his hands. This was also shown as stock
footage in <I>Gun On Ice Planet Zero - Part I</I>. This scene is present in the 
May 8 script and intact in the SV (and SFC.)<P>

[<A HREF="#M">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H3><A NAME="M2">M2. Serina's News Report (1m50s/18s)</A></H3>

Most of the following material, including all of Serina's lines, was
deleted in the HV. In the OV it is clearly shown that Serina is a news
reporter, and she was in the middle of a broadcast when the Cylons
attacked Caprica. The segment begins just prior to Omega informing Adama
of a Cylon wave of ships attacking the inner planets, and immediately
after the scene of the three Battlestars in the background. It continues
up to the point where Serina shouts "Boxey!" during the Cylon attack on
Caprica. One sequence of the ship veering away is shown <I>before</I> Omega's 
line in the HV, but <I>after</I> his line in the OV (during Starbuck and 
Boomer's dialogue.) This scene is in the May 8 script and intact in the 
SV (and SFC.)<P>


A good number of Serina's scenes were filmed but never shown. Jane
Seymour discussed them in an interview in <I>Starlog #40</I>. "I was playing a
news reporter who was announcing that everything was being destroyed. 
She went through traumas there, trying to fight for the rights of the 
people who were surviving and then realizing half-way through the film 
that she had the equivalent of galactic cancer. <I>None of this was shown
in the final version</I> [my emphasis]." Seymour suggests that the reporter
sequence was absent in the two-hour version of the pilot shown to her
(undoubtedly the CV), and it is absent in the HV. Its inclusion in the
OV may be related to Seymour agreeing to appear in the second two-hour
episode of the series, <I>Lost Planet Of The Gods</I>.<P>

Here is the complete scene as shown in the HV:

   <DL><DD>Three battlestars in the background. The Galactica veers away from
   the fleet. The scene switches to the main bridge.<P>

   <DD><B>Omega:</B>   Commander, the long-range scanner picks up wave after wave
            of small ships heading towards all inner planets.<P>

   <DD>The Cylons begin their attack on Caprica. Boxey is seen running with
   the crowd down the stairs. Serina, with microphone in her hand,
   shouts "Boxey!"</DL>

Here is the complete scene as shown in the OV:

   <DL><DD>Space shot - three battlestars are in the background. The scene
   switches to the main bridge.<P>

   <DD><B>Omega:</B>   Commander, the long-range scanner picks up wave after wave
            of small ships heading towards all inner planets.<P>

   <DD>Starbuck, Boomer and Greenbean watch in their Vipers as the Galactica
   veers away from the fleet.<P>

   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Boomer...
   <DD><B>Boomer:</B>  I see it...
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Where's she going?
   <DD><B>Boomer:</B>  Don't ask me... the Commander's calling the shots.
   <DD><B>Greenbean:</B>     Hey you guys... What's going on? The Galactica's
            pulling out.
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      There's gotta be a good reason.<P>

   <DD>The scene then switches back to Galactica's main bridge.<P>

   <DD><B>Omega:</B>   We have a civilian broadcast transmission coming up here
            shortly.
   <DD><B>Tigh:</B>    Perhaps we're in time, Commander.<P>

   <DD>On deck, the command staff are watching the monitor as Serina begins
   her news report from Caprica.<P>

   <DD><B>Serina:</B>  Preparations continue through the night here in the Caprica
            Presidium. We can see at the moment it is somewhat deserted,
            but with the new dawn it will be full of Capricans coming
            here, eagerly and joyfully, to usher in a new era, the era
            of peace. So far, details of the armistice meeting going on
            at this very moment on the Star Kobol, are not coming in as
            we had hoped for. It seems that this is due to unusual
            electrical interferences which are blocking out all
            interstellar communcations. However, as soon as they are
            available, we will be showing you the first pictures of
            something which has been described as the most signficant
            event in history.<P>

   <DD>As Serina continues here report, the Cylons begin their attack on
   Caprica.<P>

   <DD><B>Serina:</B>  Oh, my God! It's a tremendous explosion... Are we getting
            this on the camera... People are running everywhere and
            they... are running in all different directions. Ladies and
            gentlemen... It's terrible! They're bombing the city...<P>

   <DD>Boxey is seen running with the crowd down the stairs. Serina, with
   microphone in her hand, shouts "Boxey!"</DL>

At this point the television pilot and the home video converge.<P>

<H3><A NAME="M3">M3. Athena's Locker Scene (2m57s)</A></H3>

After Adama tells representatives of the new fleet of his goal of
reaching Earth, is one infamous "lost" scene where Starbuck decides to
apologize to Athena for his confrontation in the corridor after his
emergency landing. As Athena is undressing in her quarters, Starbuck
makes his entrance. Athena uses her locker door to cover herself while
Starbuck tries not to look in her direction. This scene is intact in the
SV (and SFC.) It is not in the May 8 script, and was probably included
to justify Starbuck's subsequent pursuit of Cassiopeia. Here is the
complete scene:

   <DL><DD><B>Stabuck:</B> Anybody here?
   <DD><B>Athena:</B>  Oh... Starbuck!<P>

   <DD>Athena, caught undressing, hides behind her locker door<P>

   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      I came to apologize for how I treated you. I've seen
            so many guys from my squadron... burned up. I guess I was
            looking to take it out on somebody. I wish it hadn't have
            been you.
   <DD><B>Athena:</B>  It's not important, Starbuck. I don't know what is.
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Look, I'm sorry about Zac... and your mother.
   <DD><B>Athena:</B>  You don't have to say anything.
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Zac pulled my patrol.
   <DD><B>Athena:</B>  He wanted to go!
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Athena, this is the time for sticking together. Maybe
            we can talk about this...
   <DD><B>Athena:</B>  Us, you mean.
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Well, I guess it is a little overdue.
   <DD><B>Athena:</B>  Starbuck, I don't k now. I don't think any of us have any
            kind of future any more...
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Don't say that. Thing's are going to be all right.
            Look, if we can handle what we've just been through... we
            can handle anything.
   <DD><B>Athena:</B>  Later, maybe. But things are so fresh in my mind.
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Athena, I said I was sorry.
   <DD><B>Athena:</B>  Starbuck, I don't want to care about anybody, but especially
            you. Zac couldn't wait to get out there... get all shot up.
            And you, you're worse than Zac.
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      I think of it as an obligation.
   <DD><B>Athena:</B>  No you don't. You like to pretend that they're out there
            dragging you by the boot straps, but you really can't wait
            to get up there in that machine of yours.
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Well, I guess we see things differently.
   <DD><B>Athena:</B>  I guess we do.
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      I said what I came to say.</DL>

[<A HREF="#M">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H3><A NAME="M4">M4. Athena Consoles Adama (1m56s)</A></H3>

In this missing scene, Adama is sitting alone in his chamber, depressed,
and is consoled by his daughter Athena. In the May 8 script, this scene
is present between the scene were Apollo is on the shuttle, pledging to
see "what's on the bottom of the conspiracy of silence" on the food
shortage, and the following scene which took place on the Rising Star.
In the OV, this scene appeared after Dr. Wilker presents Boxey with his
droid daggit, and before Starbuck's famous love scene in the launch
tube. Why was it inserted here in the OV? Perhaps to replace <I>another</I>
Adama/Athena scene in the original script which was never shown (the
subject of that scene was Starbuck and Athena's relationship with him.)
This scene is intact in the SV (and SFC.) Arguably, this makes more
sense before the Rising Star scene, where it is placed in the script,
making it appear prior to Adama's confrontation with Apollo (<A HREF=
"#M5">#M5</A>.)

   <DL><DD><B>Athena:</B>  Father... Father? Are you all right?
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   If any one amongst us says that he is all right after what
            has happened, I recommend him for catharsis treatment.
   <DD><B>Athena:</B>  That's not the warrior I'm used to. Whatever happened to the
            joy of living to fight another day?
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   Ah yes, the joy of living. You were aboard the Galactica.
            You didn't see them down there, their faces. The old, the
            young, desperate, begging, screaming for a chance to come
            aboard, a chance to live. And there I was like God, passing
            out priorities as if they were tickets to a lottery. There
            was one woman with a child in her arms. She tore at my arms
            as we were boarding the launch to come back.
   <DD><B>Athena:</B>  Father, don't...
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   The guard came up - I saw him out of the corner of my eye, I
            stried to stop him - he shoved her away, pushed her. He
            didn't see the child. I don't know what happened to that
            woman... Oh God, I don't want it any more.
   <DD><B>Athena:</B>  Father
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   Let someone else do it. Take this burden from me...</DL>

[<A HREF="#M">TOP OF DOCUMENT</A>]
<H3><A NAME="M5">M5. Apollo Confronts Adama (1m46s)</A></H3>

After Apollo tells the Council of his mission to go through the Nova of
Madegon, there is another missing scene - where Apollo engages in a
heated argument with his father. Adama accuses Apollo of playing into
Sire Uri's hands, and Apollo says his father isn't willing to take
risks. While this scene is not in the May 8 script, there are several
other scenes where Apollo confronts Adama, sometimes in the company of
Athena. He even accuses him of cowardice. Adama actually resigns his
command in this script and the novelization, fulfilling Adama's desire
in the previous missing scene (<A HREF="#M4">#M4</A>) to have the burden of command lifted
from him. This scene is incomplete in the Sci-Fi Channel version, where
it is missing the last three lines, and may be incomplete in the SV on
which it was based. Here is the complete scene:

   <DL><DD><B>Adama:</B>   And just what did you think you were doing volunteering for
            a mission like that? Sire Uri must be laughing up his
            sleeve.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  What's worrying you more, the mission or your being made to
            look foolish by Uri? I'm sorry, I know better than that, but
            there was no choice. You didn't seem to have a viable plan.
            It was his way or mine.
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   Now you see. He's got us doing it. Turning one against the
            other. If he weren't such a prima donna I'd say let him
            lead. But we must not allow ourselves be fractioned off,
            there are so few of us left. A single voice is imperative.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  But not his! He's only interested in himself. I don't
            understand how he ever got elected to the Council of the
            Twelve. And you voted for him.
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   You should have known him back in the renaissance days of
            Caprtica. He was one of the best, a builder, an architect of
            dreams. Now he just sits and decays himself. No wonder our
            world fell apart.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  Looking back is contagious. Decay and corruption go hand in
            hand with defeatism and lack of action. Uri moved in because
            you failed to act, to have an alternative to his plan.
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   I believe it is sometimes prudent to steer away from the
            flames once you've been badly burnt.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  And I'd say you'd better look around more carefully. You're
            nursing wounds while we're still in the fire.</DL>

<H3><A NAME="M6">M6. Baltar Escapes Execution (8s/2s)</A></H3>

This is perhaps the most well known of all the missing or altered
scenes. Shown after the Colonials reach Carillon, and before the actual
landing procedures, is the scene of Baltar's execution. Baltar was
originally slated to die in the pilot. Versions with Baltar's execution
include the CV, the USV, the HV, the May 8 script and the novelization.<P>

However, this scene was altered for the television version of the pilot
(both HV and SV), as Baltar was "spared" to became a regular cast member
of the show (see also <A HREF="#M11">#M11</A>.) According to John Colicos (Baltar), the new
sequences were redirected by Glen Larson himself. This scene is intact
in the SV (and SFC.) Here is the complete scene, including those parts
common to all versions of the pilot:

   <DL><DD><B>Leader:</B>  Baltar, I have grave news. A handful of Colonials prevail,
            but we will soon find them.
   <DD><B>Baltar:</B>  What of our bargain? My colony was to be spared!
   <DD><B>Leader:</B>  I altered the bargain.
   <DD><B>Baltar:</B>  How can you change one side of a bargain?
   <DD><B>Leader:</B>  When there is no other side... You have missed the entire
            point of the war.
   <DD><B>Baltar:</B>  But I have no ambitions against you?
   <DD><B>Leader:</B>  Could you think me so foolish as to trust a man who would
            see his own race destroyed?
   <DD><B>Baltar:</B>  Not destroyed, subjugated... under me.
   <DD><B>Leader:</B>  There can be no survivors... So long as one human remains
            alive, the Alliance is threatened.
   <DD><B>Baltar:</B>  Surely you don't mean me?
   <DD><B>Leader:</B>  We thank you for your help, Baltar... Your time is at an end<P>

   <DD>In the HV, the Centurion on Baltar's left pulls his hair back, as the
   one on his right full unsheathes his knife. Baltar cries "No!" His
   head is held back and his throad exposed as the Cylon is shown
   applying his knife. It quickly cuts away to the next scene on the
   Carillon surface.<P>

   <DD>In the television version, Imperious Leader interupts the Cylon at
   the moment that he unsheathes his knife. He utters:<P>

   <DD><B>Leader:</B>  No, not now, Centurion.<P>

   <DD>The camera then focuses on Baltar a little longer, as Imperious
   Leader utters these words:<P>

<H3><A NAME="M7">M7. The Carillon Landram Scene (1m58s/15s)</A></H3>

Only a few seconds of this scene are shown in the HV. Here Apollo
instructs Boxey to look for high concentrations of Tylium, and tells him
of the origins of the Cylons, and human attitudes to artificial
intelligence (including Cylons and drones like Boxey's new pet Daggit.)
Radically altered from the same scene in the May 8 script, where the
subject is not of the Cylon's origins, but of prejudice and hate. In the
development of the series, the Cylons were downgraded from humanoid
lizards in armor, to cyborgs, to finally the genocidal robots as
presented in the series. This scene is intact in the SV (and SFC.) Here
is the complete scene:

   <DL><DD><B>Apollo:</B>  We can't aford to stay in any one place for too long.
   <DD><B>Boxey:</B>   Why? Why do these people want to hurt us. What did we do to
            them?
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  It's not what we did to them. It's what they fear we could
            do. You see, they're not like us. They're machines created
            by living creatures a long, long time ago.
   <DD><B>Boxey:</B>   If they're machines, why don't we just turn them off?
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  Boy, I wish we could. But these machines aren't all that
            simple. You see, some machines are smart so that they can
            function better than a lot of living creatures.
   <DD><B>Boxey:</B>   They're not smart.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  In some ways they are. They're programmed to think a lot
            faster than than we do. On the other hand, they're not as
            individual. We can do a little more of the unexpected. It's
            about the only advantage we have.
   <DD><B>Boxey:</B>   Why did we make them?
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  We didn't. Another race did, a race of reptiles called
            Cylons. After a while the Cylons discovered humans were the
            most practical form of creature in this system. So they
            copied our bodies, but they built them bigger and stronger
            than we are. And they can exchange parts so they can live
            forever.
   <DD><B>Boxey:</B>   Maybe the Cylons who created these machines could just turn
            them off.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  There are no more real Cylons. They died off thousands of
            yahrens ago, leaving behind a race of super-machines, but we
            still call them Cylons.
   <DD><B>Boxey:</B>   Will that happen to us too? Will our drones and machines
            take over?
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  We are very careful not to make our drones quite that
            intelligent or individual  - present company excepted,
            Muffit.<P>

   <DD>Muffit lets out a mechanical bark. Apollo humorously adds:<P>

   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  As a matter of fact we'd better have this drone checked. I
            think he's been listening awfully closly.</DL>

<H3><A NAME="M8">M8. The Tylium Mine Mystery (1m39s)</A></H3>

This scene with Tigh and Adama takes place in Adama's private quarters
just after Adama's "Commander's Journal" scene in the OV, which has been
clipped (see <A HREF="#C10">#C10</A>.) It also appears at the start of the SV's second hour
(the first hour ended with the woman screaming in the elevator.) Here,
Adama wonders about the mystery of Carillon and reveals to Tigh that
Baltar's people discovered the Tylium mine. This sequence and the
following missing sequence (<A HREF="#M9">#M9</A>) are best viewed after the screaming
woman and before the Council's Carillon session, to preserve the
integrity of the other Carillon sequences. This scene is intact in the
SV (and SFC.) It is not in the May 8 script, but is portions of it,
including Baltar's intelligence report, are alluded to in the Council
Session on Carillon. Here is the complete scene:

   <DL><DD><B>Tigh:</B>    You wanted to see me?
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   I've been sitting here for yahrens, it seems, examining our
            military intelligence on this Carillon outpost.
   <DD><B>Tigh:</B>    I didn't think we had any beyond our exploration for fighter
            fuel.
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   That's the disquieting part. It was Baltar's people who
            engineered that expedition. It declared the Tylium too
            miminal for mining, and our military intelligence is based
            on that report.
   <DD><B>Tigh:</B>    And now we find one of the largest Tylium mining opration
            sin the star system.
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   Exactly. So the mystery is, what's behind such a hugh mining
            operation. There's no local food source to feed the
            laborers, they must be bringing it from who knows how far.
   <DD><B>Tigh:</B>    They have plenty of it to share. Some of our peple are
            getting downright obese.
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   Yes. And there's another mystery. There seems to be no
            connection the Ovion workers underground and the resort on
            the surface, and yet there must be some connection.
   <DD><B>Tigh:</B>    Do you suspect a tie-in with the Cylon Empire?
   <DD><B>Adama:</B>   Where Baltar's involved, I suppose I suspect everything.
            You've had no reports of anything odd, or out of the
            ordinary?

<H3><A NAME="M9">M9. Hope It's The Grog (1m03s)</A></H3>

This scene appears in the OV, after the woman screams in the elevator.
Here, as Serina and Apollo go down to the gambling resort, Apollo
overhears Sire Uri talking to a fellow council member about his plans
for disarming the Colonial fleet. Immediately following this scene is
the special Council meeting where Uri makes his disarmament proposal.
This scene is mangled in the SFC version and may not be intact in the
SV, on which it was based. Here is the complete scene:

   <DL><DD><B>Serina:</B>  It's a circus... a wonderland.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  Why don't we win a fortune.
   <DD><B>Serina:</B>  Why don't we, my beautiful captain!<P>

   <DD>Scene switches to Sire Uri talking to a fellow Council member.<P>

   <DD><B>Uri:</B>     We have here the food and necessities to feed our people. We
            have the support of a culture quite content to be
            subservient to our needs. We are far away from the Cylons so
            as not to post a threat to them. At least we ought not to
            pose a threat, and would not, if we destroyed our war
            machines.<P>

   <DD>Apollo overhears Uri's conversation.<P>

   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  What's this?
   <DD><B>Uri:</B>     Ahh... our young warrior or should I say savior. I was just
            pointing out that the Cylons destroyed our cities because we
            were a threat to their order. Here, isolated from them, we
            pose no threat, or would not, if we disposed of ships and
            weapons. What do you think of my proposal?
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  Hope it's the grog.

<H3><A NAME="M10">M10. Conversation Below Carillon (54s/11s)</A></H3>

One truly interesting new scene is a dialogue below Carillon between
Apollo and Starbuck, just moments after they saw an Ovion followed by
two Cylons down the corridor. They are hiding in a corner, and any
minute, Boxey is going to appear out of the elevator. What makes this
scene fascinating is that there are elements in the HV that are not in
the OV, but the OV (and the SV) is longer.<P>

A copy of the script dated May 8, 1978, supports the HV version. The
dialogue may have been reshot for one principal reason - to change the
context of Carillon's destruction. The two versions support two
fundamentally different theories. Here is the complete scene as shown in
the HV:

   <DL><DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Me and my big mouth.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  At least we know the secret of Carillon.
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Do we? What's the connection between the casino and
            all this?
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  Let's get out of here, then figure that one out.</DL>

In the HV, the destruction appears to be accidental. The snuffing out of
an untold number of Ovions, Cylons (and even humans) was a result of a
stray spark misfired from laser fire between Colonials and Cylons. This 
is morally unsatisfying in a show where everything is part of a greater
battle between the greater battle of Good versus Evil. Hence, new
dialogue had to be added to give "meaning" to Carillon's destruction.
Here is the complete scene as shown in the OV:

   <DL><DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Me and my big mouth.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  ... Carillon. Let's get out of here.
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Wait, you go.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  What are you talking about?
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      We still don't know the connection between the casino
            and this mining operation? For all we know, they could be
            supplying half the fuel for the Cylon empire. We just can't
            leave it fully operational.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  We've got out entire population up on top - that includes
            women and children.
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Well, you get up there and warn them. I won't do
            anything until you've had a chance to get away.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  What can you do by yourself?
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      This whole planet is loaded with Tylium. If I can
            ignite it with my lasers it will blow the entire planet
            apart.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  Starbuck, I can't lose you down here, you'll never get out
            allive.
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      You don't have a choice.
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  Starbuck:</B>, I had to leave Zac behinid, I can't leave you
            too. You go up, I'll set fire to the Tylium.
   <DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      Apollo, by the time we get to arguing about this it
            will...
   <DD><B>Apollo:</B>  Shhhhh.... somebody's coming.</DL>

In the OV, the act is clearly premeditated, for the purpose of crippling
Cylon fuel resources and protecting the human population from the forces
of Evil. That the fire may have been accidental doesn't change the facts
- Starbuck and Apollo were ready to ignite the Tylium and "blow the
whole planet apart." The Cylons were out to exterminate the humans, and
the Ovions used them as carrion. In this context, the destruction of
Carillon and its inhabitants becomes morally satisfying and Good
triumphs over Evil.<P>

Starbuck's statement about blowing the planet apart makes his later
statement - that if they don't stop the Cylons "we're going to go back
and live on that rock", confusing and contradictory. Did Starbuck know
that planet was going to blow up or didn't he?<P>

In this scene, the new Imperious Leader (the old one perished with his
base star over Carillon) gives Baltar a Base Ship, and a new companion,
Lucifer. An edited version of this scene, with additional footage, is
also in <I>Lost Planet of the Gods Part I</I>. Lucifer's role is unclear from
this scene, as it is never stated. Nevertheless, Lucifer is assigned the
role of Baltar's assistant (see also <A HREF="#M6">#M6</A>.) This scene is intact in the
SV (and the SFC.) Here is the complete scene, as presented at the
conclusion of the pilot:

   <DD><B>Leader:</B>  No, to serve your people, to help us extend the hand of
            truce.
   <DD><B>Baltar:</B>  Truce?
   <DD><B>Leader:</B>  My predecessor was present at a time when our Empire was
            less capable of tolerance. Now that we are omnipotent, we
            can afford to be more charitable. You will explain my policy
            of good will. I have spared you, I will spare them.
   <DD><B>Baltar:</B>  They are not likely to be receptive.

<H3><A NAME="D2">D2. The Ovion's Words</A></H3>

The translation of the Ovion's words to the Cylon Centurion were dropped
in the OV. Here is the complete transcript, taken from the HV:

   <DL><DD><B>Ovion:</B>   The humans are in full attendance.
   <DD><B>Cylon:</B>   How many warriors?
   <DD><B>Ovion:</B>   We have counted over 200.
   <DD><B>Cylon:</B>   Nearly their full complement of warriors. See that they
            remain entertained until the end. Then they will be yours in
            the lower chambers.</DL>

<H3><A NAME="D3">D3. Battle Over Carillon</A></H3>

   <DL><DD><B>Starbuck:</B>      [If we don't stop them, we're going to go back and
            live on that rock.]<P>

   <DD>In the HV, there is a 13 second sequence between these spoken lines,
   which ends with the destruction of one Cylon ship by Starbuck. In the
   OV, it is a 25-second sequence, which results in the destruction of
   three Cylon ships. The latter appears to be stock footage taken from
   the earlier battle for the Colonies. The HV appears to be the
   original version, as it is accompanied by music absent from the OV
   version of the sequence.<P>

<H3><A NAME="D4">D4. The End Credits</A></H3>

The musical soundtrack accompanying the end credits is different. In the
HV, it uses the main credit musical theme (used only in the pilot
episode.) In the OV, the familiar series theme is used.<P>
