<B>ST.PAUL, Minn.</B> Aug. 25, 1979 (AP) -- The parents of a 15-year-old boy who
jumped 200 feet to his death from a bridge after <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>
was canceled say the boy's whole life was wrapped up in the television
space show.<P>

"I hope we never ever see it on TV again, because it would just crush
us," Dawn Seidel, the boy's stepmother, said Saturday.<P>

Eddie Seidel Jr. was buried Friday. He committed suicide in the pre-dawn
darkness Wednesday after telling police from his perch on the High
Bridge railing that he was upset that <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> had been
dropped by the ABC network.<P>

"I talked about suing ABC or doing something," Mrs. Seidel said. "But my
husband said to just leave things like they are and not make a big
hassle out of it.<P>

"I know it's not their fault because they had the program."<P>

Like many a teen-age boy, Eddie was deeply absorbed with outer space
subjects.<P>

For Eddie, said Mrs. Seidel, it meant a roomful of posters, magazines,
plastic models and other paraphernalia about <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>.<P>

"They made a lot of money off him," she said. "He bought everything put
on the market. He also took tape recordings of all the shows."<P>

Eddie's world was wrapped up in the programs he viewed in his own
bedroom, on a TV set he bought.<P>

His father, Edward Seidel Sr., described Eddie as a sometimes brilliant
boy who couldn't find enough in life to keep him interested.<P>

The father said he learned about four years ago the boy had been
sniffing gas with friends so he sent him to a psychiatrist.<P>

"The psychiatrist said he was just kind of bored with life, that there
was nothing here for him to excel in," said Seidel. "There was no real
challenge here on this earth.<P>

His stepmother said he got Bs and B-pluses in school, and an occasional
A, but that he was mostly bored with classes.<P>

Seidel said his son came home from his job as a supermarket stockboy
about 5 p.m. Tuesday, apparently in good spirits.<P>

The boy went to his room to watch television. The family did not see him
the rest of the night. When his 19-year-old sister, Crystal, passed
Eddie's door later that night, she found a note -- his last will and
testament. He had gone off on his motorbike.<P>

He told his parents in the note they'd find his body under the High
Bridge, a half-mile, two-lane link between downtown St. Paul and the
suburb of West St. Paul. The Seidels reached it about 10 minutes after
Eddie had jumped and landed on ground beside the river.<P>

Seidel said when Eddie learned last spring that <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>
was being canceled, he contacted the ABC network to ask officials to
keep it on. The last rerun of the program was shown Aug. 5.<P>

"I really should have tried to get him into a gifted chldren type
situation," Seidel said. "But it's too late to look back and say I
should have."<P>

He said he didn't realize what an influence a TV program could have on
his son.<P>

"I was never sure it did influence kids that bad, but now I'm convinced
it does," he said.<P></BODY>
