Chris Scalf has been doing some very impressive Battlestar Galactica comic book art. He's been contacted by Maximum Press, who are interested in having him work on their <A HREF=comic.html>BG comic series.</A><p>

These thumbnails are links to several large pages of Chris's art.  The image shown on the thumbnail is, in most cases, only about a quarter of the actual image.  These are pretty big files.<p>

If you're interested in Chris's art, you can phone/FAX him at (810) 685-0335 for more recent information. I suppose you could also call or write to Maximum Press. They'd probably know more about Chris' role than he would.<p>
