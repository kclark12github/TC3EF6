<H1>About This Site</H1>
This Battlestar Galactica collection is maintained by Mark F. Heiman (<A HREF=mailto:mheiman@carleton.edu>mheiman@carleton.edu</A>).  It's running off of my Power Macintosh 7100/66, so if it's down occasionally, that's probably because I've crashed the machine doing something else.<P>

All of the original graphics were created in Adobe Photoshop.  These pages aren't specifically "Enhanced for Netscape" (what an unfortunate phrase!), but they do make use of some Netscape extensions, where appropriate.<p>

Comments, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome.  I have a real job, though, so while everything gets answered, it may take me a few days.<p>

<H2>Why a Battlestar Galactica site?</H2>
Well, I've always had a soft spot in my brain for BG, and when interest in the series began to revive with the Sci-Fi channel broadcasts, I thought it would be nice if BG fans had a central source for information and resources about the show. This site has been that source since late 1994.<P>

To be honest, I think the show was often somewhat silly and occasionally even campy, but it's still good fun. That's more than you can say for a lot of TV.<P>


<H2>Can I use this on my page?<br>(An Editorial)</H2>
Strictly speaking, a lot of the material on these pages belongs to Universal Studios, but I think we're just within the realm of "fair use" insofar as it applies to the net.  If you want to use something, take it in that spirit.<p>

Everything else I consider to be copyrighted by the person who created it, whenever that information is available.  For the most part, it's safe to say that if I have something published here, the author intends it to be available.  If you take something, just retain appropriate credits.<p>

However, I firmly believe that one of the current weaknesses of the World Wide Web is needless duplication.  As someone who maintains a TV-related site, I've seen at least five or six <b>dozen</b> "Ultimate TV Show Lists" all of which try to be a little better than the last (and those are just the ones who linked to me).  It's a sad waste of effort and a source of confusion and headache to users.<p>

Mind you, I have nothing against duplication.  If one site had to maintain the single "Ultimate TV Show List" they'd be swamped by the traffic and probably have to kill the service.  What makes sense, though, is for multiple sites to cooperate to build a single list which is either segmented or mirrored across several servers.  Everyone gains, and no one has to reinvent the Wheel of Fortune (I'd like to buy a vowel!).<p>

So... if you're borrowing my stuff to start your own Battlestar Galactica page, let me know.  I'll be flattered, and then I'll suggest we come up with some way to avoid pointless duplication.  If I discover that you're already mirroring some portion of my site, I may suggest that you take it over officially, thus reducing the traffic on my server.  At the very least, credit me for my efforts.<p>

The key is cooperation.  I hate to see effort and creativity going to waste.<br>
