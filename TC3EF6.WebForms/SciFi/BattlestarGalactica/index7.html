Battlestar Galactica has been on people's minds lately.  Last year, Maximum Press began to publish a <A HREF=comic.html>comic based on BG.</A>  Some people have chosen to see this as an indication that a TV revival may be in our future.<p>

<h3>Revival Information</h3>

There's been an ongoing campaign to revive Galactica.  The documents below describe this campaign and its current status.  If the information here seems old to you, that's simply because there hasn't been any new news.  As soon as something happens, you'll see it here.<p>
(And, of course, if you hear anything, let me know!)<p>
