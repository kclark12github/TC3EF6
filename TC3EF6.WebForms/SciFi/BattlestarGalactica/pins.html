 As we Battlestar Galacticans know, there have been - to say the least - heated debates on this most prestigious of mailing lists with us trying to make some sense out of the Colonial Uniforms which seem to defy all laws of rank/award/unit designation as well as most items of consistency. In attempting to contribute to the chaos I decided to try and solve one aspect of this mystery - that of the ranking system since I have had so military experience and my share of promotions in the 6 years that I served in the California Cadet Corps [:).<P>

   I wanted to study the collar pins with my computer, but because the pins are too small to analyze as they appear on television (maybe if we scan the actual film reel with a 5000 dpi scanner, NAAAH) and I cannot scan in the pictures of Our Heroes from the supplement books I decided to let someone else do the work for me and turned to our Official Battlestar Galactica Worldwide Web Page. There I downloaded all 2 images (pathetic, isn't it?) with Our Heroes wearing their dress uniforms and snipped and enlarged the best views of their collar pins. Naturally, the amount of data available was limited by I decided to give that 'ol Colonial try!<P>

   My initial attempts looked very promising. You guys probably remember my joyful e-mail proclaiming that I solved this little paradox. I originally believed that there was a different pin for each rank, and although some may resemble the U.S. Army Intelligence Insignia they are indeed different in shape and color. Michelle, you asked me for ascii art so here it is:<P>

        Rank: Captain    Rank: Commander

           Apollo             Adama
</PRE>
 


   We assume that in the BSG universe Commander outranks Captain, sort of like how an Army Major outranks a Navy Lieutenant but in reverse. I couldn't draw Starbuck's because I couldn't do a Pentagon using ascii art, but I originally thought that it was a pentagon with a star in the middle with all points connecting the corners of the pentagon and 5 lines going outwards from the middle of each of the 5 sides. I was pretty sure Tigh, Athena, Omega, and Cassie would be just as simple.<P>

   What I failed to realize was that pictures can look different when viewed on a Sun, Silicon Graphics, Intel, and Macintosh. Although there was a limit as to how much I couldn enlarge and enhance the pins, I was sure that there was enough visual evidence to support my theory. Unfortunately, rewatching the pictures on my Intel at home and the school Power Macs revealed picturees that were a little sharper and that seemed to contradict everything that I did so far. As I was putting this picture together for you I realized that all the pins appear to be a pentagon with a 5-pointed star inside and rays going outwards from each side! By the Lord of Kobol, a total disaster!<P>

   I was ready to surrender in shame when I realized that even this is not definite evidence. Because the pictures are not perfectly sharp because of their limited resolution from the original pictures we can only speculate. Picture #1 is Apollo's pin from the picture where he's standing with Adama. We can clearly see that it has a bright, silver 5-pointed star in the center of what looks like an Octagon with 4 long rays going in a cross and what appear to be 4 shorter stubs. The bottom picture was darkened a little to enhance the star.<P>

   Picture 2 is Adama's pin (duhhhh) and the most obvious difference is that it is only silver, but I suspect that this is because of this different uniform class like Starfleet has and not a ranking system like the U.S. now uses for its insignias. The bottom picture was sharpened a little. I'm not exactly sure what shape it is anymore. It could be a square as my ascii art shows or a pentagon, but it all depends on which computer you view it. However, and I always suspected this even from the TV episodes, the rays on his corners appear longer than Apollo's on whose pin the vertical ones are dominant. On Adama's the diagnol ones appear to be almost the same length.<P>

   Picture 3 is another of Apollo's pins on his dress uniform. The quality is worst because the original is the smallest. Detail enhancement on the bottom doesn't help but it confirms that there is a 5-pointed star in the middle, 4 horizontal and vertical rays, and shorter, stubbier, diagnal rays which appear to be triangular in shape, similar to a leaf which cannot be seen clearly in Picture 1.<P>

   Picture 4 is Starbuck's pin. I think it is the best evidence yet that the central star is inside a Pentagon but for some reason  think that the diagonal "leaves" are a little different, but that might just be because of the poor, fuzzy quality of the enlargments themselves.<P>

   So, the evidence is inconclusive. Until we raid Universal Studio's soon and have a field day for ourselves in the costume department (I'll take you all on a tour of the San Fernando Valley!) or unless someone takes the original film and scans it in using a 5000 dpi $45,000 scanner we will never know. I wouldn't trust buying the uniforms from a SF supply place, because they might not have all versions available or only 1 rank pin which would ruin the fun. I personally believe that these collar pins denote rank, NOT what ship a Colonial Warrior serves on because that's how it's done in the real world, with the shoulder patches or another set of collar pins denoting branch. Actually, they probably were meant supposed to denote rank but because of production costs and too many deadlines someone never had the chance to come up with a cute system and so they grabbed whatever was available and hoped that the viewers would never notice. Yeah, like being a Star Trek fan doesn't turn some of us into nit pickers!!<P>

   BTW, Leave the Pegasus pins and the decoration system out of this! This machinery is already too complicated as it stands. We don't need any more monkey wrenches being thrown in, sort of like Baltar's "was his head cut off or not" thing.  Oh one more thing: remember when Apollo gave Boxey his pin and made him an honorary Colonial warrior? That HAD to be a rank pin! Captain Picard did the same when he was trapped with those honor students in that turbo lift. Besides, it was easier to give Boxey a collar pin that ripping off the whole damn shoulder patch [:), which in my opinion represents either the battlestar one is on or the squadron to which one belongs. <P>
