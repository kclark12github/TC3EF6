<H2>I. Introduction</H2>

Most of the following articles were extracted from the SF Lovers archive
at Rutgers University (ftp://sflovers.rutgers.edu), originally posted in
the newsgroup rec.arts.sf-lovers and its successor, rec.arts.sf.tv.<P>

Jerry Boyajian was a regular poster on the Internet, and is the author
of the original massive <I>Twin Peaks Timeline</I> file. He contributed regularly
to the rec.arts.comics.misc forum, and his name appears on the Bill
Sienkiewicz comic book list. Jerry vigorously defended <I>Battlestar Galactica</I>
when it came under attack from more serious science fiction fans. A
man of many interests, his presence on the Internet is missed.<P>

Elliott C. Buchholz is the author of several episode guides on the Internet,
including the <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> guides at Tardis and the Carleton WWW
site. He can be contacted at the following addresses:

   <DD><B>MSNetwork:</B> buc@msn.com
   <DD><B>Compuserve:</B> 71034.2464@compuserve.com<P>

Jeff Standish is also the author of a <I>BSG/Star Trek: The Next Generation</I>
crossover story, one of the first BSG fan stories circulating on the
Net.<P>

The last article was posted by <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> casting directory Patti
Hayes in 1992 in the rec.arts.sf.movies forum, in response to a thread on 
Baltar's beheading in the <I>Battlestar Galactica</I> pilot. It is not in the
Rutgers archive and is represented here for the first time. I tried to
contact her regarding the story bible but could never reach her.<P>

Additional excerpts of Arpanet and Usenet posts also appear in the
separate file "Information on the Upcoming Battlestar Galactica Revival",
which has posts going back to 1985. Three press articles from 1979
(the suicide, Soviet and <I>Galactica 1980</I> articles) were originally
posted on Arpanet (precurser to Usenet), and are archived at Rutgers,
along with a separate article on <I>Buck Rogers</I>' second season.<P>

Much of the information here was used in the first edition of the
"Battlestar Galactica Frequently Asked Questions" file, released in May
1994, and subsequently updated in October of the same year. It has
gone through several versions, the latest released July 1, 1996
(version 3.3).<P>

<H2>II. The Posts</H2>

Subject: Battlestar Galactica Info.</B>

Here is some information that might answer some questions that have been
raised on the net.  This posting includes:

     1.)  Episodes released on home video (at least the ones I can
          remember).
     2.)  The beginning words (There are those who believe...) from the
          original movie.
     3.)  Titles of novels that have been released.
     4.)  Definitions of the units of time, distance, and measurement that
          have been used.

1.)  There have been several episodes of BG released on MCA Home Video.
     Most of these episodes are:

      Battlestar Galactica (2 hour version of the original 3 hour pilot)
      The Lost Warrior
      The Long Patrol
      The Magnificent Warriors
      The Young Lords
      Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack (A combination of "The Living
         Legend" and "Fire in Space")
      The Man With Nine Lives
      Murder on the Rising Star
      Baltar's Escape
      Conquest of the Earth (From Galactica: 1980 - a combination of
         "Galactica Discovers Earth" and "The Night the Cylons Landed")
      The Return of Starbuck (Released on Goodtimes Home Video under
         license from MCA Home Video)

      IMHO, the episodes "War of the Gods" and "The Tombs of Kobol" were
      among the best of the series and have not been released on video.
      MCA stated they did not have any intentions of releasing any more
      episodes on video.  If they do release any more videos, I would hope
      they don't combine any more episodes together like they did with
      "Conquest of the Earth" and "Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack".

2.)  Here are the beginning words from the original BG movie (note: they
     are slightly different from those used in the weekly series).

      There are those who believe that life here began out there, far
      across the universe, with tribes of humans who may have been the
      forefathers of the Egyptians, or the Toltecs, or the Mayans - they
      may have been the architects of the great pyramids, or the lost
      civilizations of Lamuria or Atlantis.  Some believe that there may
      yet be brothers of man who even now fight to survive far, far away,
      amongst the stars.

3.)  Titles of BG novels that have been released.

      Battlestar Galactica
      Battlestar Galactica 2:  The Cylon Death Machine (adapted from the
       episode "The Gun On Ice Planet Zero")
      Battlestar Galactica 3:  The Tombs of Kobol
      Battlestar Galactica 4:  The Young Warriors
      Battlestar Galactica 5:  Galactica Discovers Earth (from Galactica
       1980)
      Battlestar Galactica 6:  The Living Legend
      Battlestar Galactica 7:  War of the Gods
      Battlestar Galactica 8:  Greetings From Earth
      Battlestar Galactica 9:  Experiment in Terra
      Battlestar Galactica:  The Photostory (Contains over 700 scenes from
       the original movie)

4.)  Units of time, distance, and measurement.

      Time Units:

       Milli Centon - 1/1000th of a Centon
       Micron - 1/100th of a Centon
       Centon - 100 Microns
       Centaurie - 100 Centons
       Sectarie - 2400 Centons
       Secton - 12 Sectaries
       Yahren - 100 Sectaries
       Hetari - 6 Sectons

      Distance Units:

       Hectar - 100 meters
       Metron - measure of distance

      Weight Unit:

       Laxar - unit of weight

All information on units of time, measurement, and weight were taken from
the "Colonial Warriors Technical Manual".  This book contains info on
definitions, flags, seals, blueprints, etc.  If anyone is interested in
getting a copy, e-mail me and I'll send you the address of where it can be
bought and it's cost.

All other information was compiled from various other sources.  It is
complete to the best of my knowledge.

These are indeed different from those in the weekly series.  Could you post
those from the series?

      Battlestar Galactica 10: The Long Patrol
      Battlestar Galactica 11: The Nightmare Machine
      Battlestar Galactica 12: "Die, Chameleon!"
      Battlestar Galactica 13: Apollo's War
      Battlestar Galactica 14: Surrender the Galactica!

Note that 11 to 14 are original novelisations of never-aired shows (except
possibly for 12, I haven't read that one) and are very good, IMHO.

Here goes  :-)

There are those who believe that life here began out there, far, far across
the universe, with tribes of humans, who may have been the forefathers of
the Egyptians, or the Toltecs, or the Mayans.  Some believe that there may
yet be brothers of man who even now fight to survive somewhere beyond the
heavens.

Well, you're slightly confused. The "three movies" you cite were not shown
in the summer of 1978, but that fall, as the pilot and four of the first
six episodes of the series. Though "Gun on Ice Planet Zero" was actually
the third one made (or fourth and fifth, depending on how you want to count
the two-parters) it was shown after two other episodes. (It also, by the
way, marked the end of John Dykstra's direct involvement in the show; most
of the effects shots thereafter were "canned" shots).

Here is a listing of the episodes and their original broadcast dates. (As
I said above, I also taped them during their original run, and I was very
methodical about noting down the date on the tape label.)

1   17 Sep 78   "Battlestar Galactica"     [3-hour pilot]
2   24 Sep 78   "Lost Planet of the Gods"  [Part 1]
3   01 Oct 78                              [Part 2]
4   08 Oct 78   "The Lost Warrior"
5   15 Oct 78   "The Long Patrol"
6   22 Oct 78   "The Gun on Ice Planet Zero"  [Part 1]
7   29 Oct 78                                 [Part 2]
8   12 Nov 78   "The Magnificent Warriors
9   19 Nov 78   "The Young Lords"
10  26 Nov 78   "The Living Legend"  [Part 1]
11  03 Dec 78                        [Part 2]
12  17 Dec 78   "Fire in Space"
13  14 Jan 79   "War of the Gods"  [Part 1]
14  21 Jan 79                      [Part 2]
15  28 Jan 79   "The Man With Nine Lives"
16  18 Feb 79   "Murder on the Rising Star"
17  25 Feb 79   "Greetings from Earth"  [2-hour episode]
18  11 Mar 79   "Baltar's Escape"
19  18 Mar 79   "Experiment in Terra"
20  01 Apr 79   "Take the Celestra"
21  29 Apr 79   "The Hand of God"

And later in the US as well -- it was one of the movies that was shown in
Sensurround -- but, as said in an early article, it was shown in Canada
*earlier* than the first US broadcast of the 3-hour pilot version.

>BALTHAZAR was killed in the 3 hour version, but was NOT in the edited

Shouldn't that be the other way around?  Since the 3-hour version was the
pilot for the series, Baltar was *not* killed, as he had to stick around
for the rest of the series. Since the 2-hour theatrical release was, in
essence, a "one-off", he was killed.

>the 2 hour version was and probably is still available on Video Cassette.

And laserdisc. A number of other random episodes were released on videotape
as well, though the only other one released on disc was the aforementioned
MISSION GALACTICA: THE CYLON ATTACK.

First came: Battlestar Galactica: The Three-Hour Tv "Mini-series" (That was
interrupted for political felgercarb!).  Then came Battlestar Galactica the
edited-down-to-under-2-hours theatrical release. The tv series was (I'm
pretty sure) at the same time as the theatrical release, but the tv
premiere was definitely first. I don't think it has been shown in its
entirety EVER AGAIN.  When shown on tv, it is chopped up into three
episodes, and heavily edited for time.

>Does anyone know of any good books on the subject

Well, there was the Battlestar Galactica Scrapbook, a real nice piece of
info put out before Galactica:1980. It's out of print, but I believe it's
advertised in the back of Starlog by some dealers.

>or if the show is out on video?

There are about 9 episodes released on video. Also released is the 2-hour
version of the movie, and an edited-together, chopped up, version of the
Pegasus 2 parter and "Fire In Space" called "Mission Galactica: The Cylon
Attack" (not too bad, at least until they release the episode in it's
entirety"

There are only 2 videos available from Galactica:1980. One is "The
Return of Starbuck," the best episode from that series. The other
video is an edited-together piece of dreck from the original 3-hour
premiere, the Wolfman Jack-humanoid Cylon episode, and bits and pieces
from a few more. If I had to vote for the worst ever edited-together
piece of anchovy-infested, slime-covered, putrid, reeking,
larva-infused, vomit-smelling piece of video butchery to ever be
released, THIS WAS IT!!! I mean, not only does the editing mesh
together like splicing a Bugs Bunny cartoon to Gone With The Wind, but
they had the audacity to dub in new dialog, with voices that matched
the original as much as Dolly Parton would being dubbed in for Darth Vader!
It was apparently decided that some love interest was needed to make
this video work, so in the middle of lines like, "C'mon, let's get
back to the Galactica!" came a sudden bass-voice saying, "And I love
you too." And never mind how they tried to explain 2 different actors
for "Dr. Zee". Can you say, twin brother, Dr. Zed? (or Zen, or
something of equal ridiculousness)

Sorry, I tend to REALLY rant and rave when talking about that.
But I agree that Galactica:1980 was doomed by ABC from the start. 7:00
on Sunday (with its special rules for kiddie-viewing) was a message
from ABC saying, "Sure we'll show it. But it ain't goin' to be around
long!"

Ah, well. Alas poor Galactica. We hardly knew ye'.

Might as well post it as well, for other BG fans.

   As some one that worked on the show at an executive level, may I
help you?

   BG was to be made as an 8 hr mini series. After the first 4 hrs were put
together (and tested in a few markets because they thought they had
something REALLY marketable) Glen Larson made arrangements to show the
first 2 hrs in Europe (Scandinavia too) and the reaction was lines around
the block. By then the same 2 hrs had aired and the young folks went
crazy and the order was in for a full 22. Universal and Larson NEVER miss a
chance to make a buck on anything and the network was excited too. I came
on board when they were just finishing the last of the mini series and
worked the show until it changed to BG 80 (what a piece of crap that was).

   I can tell you that it was a costly show to do for the time, over a
million an episode. We were always behind and over budget and scripts would
come in 2 days before we were to start shooting! There were 6 full time
editors working 24 hrs a day. About half way through the season when you
saw the previews for the next week, they were the dailies shot from Fri or
Sat. We shot 7 days a week as well. Rough cuts were run at 1 or 2 AM on
Thurs or Fri or Sat, the final print often delivered 20 minutes before you
saw it on the air on Sunday.

   Not an easy show for overtime, which cost 1/4 of the show's budget. But
the 2 hrs or 2 part episodes were all released as films because of the
stars that were in them and the need to recoup the some money.

   Mr. Larson at the time was getting a million a week in re-run fees from
his other shows (Quincy, etc)

   I have the only BIBLE for Galactica so if you need names of actors or
can give me an episode # (not the name: they usually change) I can help you
identify someone.

   By your command!
