<h1>Chris Scalf's Comic Book Plot Summary</h1>
<h2>THE MISSION:</h2>
The Galactica and her fleet are running low on certain resources...Most importantly, fuel, and a particular energy filled mineral that is vital to charging most of their laser weaponry and some life support, as well as energizers.<p>
They come up on a cluster of planets which their scanners indicate they find these important nessecities. Apollo, Starbuck, Boomer, Sheba, and a couple of newly trained cadets are sent to check these planets out in their vipers.

<h2>THE PROBLEM:</h2>
The vipers enter the atmosphere of the main planet, where they are to find what they are looking for, and scan it's surface.<p>
Apollo commands the two cadets to return to orbit and maintain long scan. But as they ascend, both crafts immediately destruct.<p>
After computations on their computers, they arrive at the conclusion that an energy field is holding them trappedin the planet's atmosphere. As they are forced to land they come upon a mysterious alien city, where they assume they will find some answers...

<h2>SUBPLOT:</h2>
Meanwhile, due to the high content of the energy mineral ( or crystal ) the Galactica is unable to establish communication with the vipers. To make matters worse, ships at the far end of the fleet report that they are recieving cylon signals, indicating that basestars may be approaching in their direction.
But lacking fuel and fire power, the Galactica can neither run nor fight.
Eventually as the story progresses, this subplot becomes more severe as the cylons draw nearer and Tigh and Adama are faced with a crisis. A plan is conjured up to scatter the fleet apart, and hide them among the many moons in the planet cluster. Inevitably, an alternate plan is also devised in which they will richochet signals off of a radiation belt on the far solar system. This gives the cylons a decoy signal to chase after buying them more time getting what they need from the planet.

<h2>THE ALIENS:</h2>
As Apollo and gang come up on the city, they are greeted by a strange race of beings, who welcome them in their "city of peace". They claim that their lifestyle is exempt of war, and that their god, Ahlahd is protecting them.
The building structures in the city are very strangely shaped, and in every area in the city, strange mirror like orbs hover in corners. The aliens claim that this is how Ahlahd surveys and watches over them.<p>

Apollo questions them about the force field holding them there, and the aliens are puzzled by this, insisting that their leader must confront Ahlahd at the temple on this matter.<p>
Upon returning from the temple, the leader declares the humans evil, and a threat to their peace. He orders them to be contained until put to death.
As this story evolves and details unfold, we eventually find out that this alien race is nothing more than a race of very naive beings, and their god, Ahlahd turns out to be the Cylons. Therefore, our heroes' goal would inevitably be to escape confinement, and find the main source projecting the energy forcefield nand destroy it.

<h2>THE CLIMAX:</h2>
Eventually, after a turn of events, a plan is devised by our heroes to destroy the main energy source, which we find is located in the heart of the city.
After a previous escape, Starbuck and Boomer are recaptured and taken to the head Cylon centurion. Meanwhile, Apollo and Sheba are trying to make it to where their vipers are being held, where they are to rendezvous after accomplishing their plan of action.<p>
Starbuck and Boomer are facing the head centurion in a gigantic structure, where the force field originates. A huge greenish yellow static like ray emerges from the main structure, and extends straight up into the sky.
A battle ensues as Starbuck and Boomer manage to break free from the alien guards holding them. With one of the aliens staff weapons, Starbuck suddenly smashes the head off of the centurion.<p>
There is a sudden stillness as the aliens stand shocked at the sight before them. Starbuck shouts, "This is your god! This is what you worship! It's nothing more than machine!"<p>
He then turns and throws the head into the energy beam causing a violent reaction as arcs of energy shoot out all over, exploding everywhere. Choas unfolds as the city begins to destruct slowly in a chain reaction.<p>
Green bolts of energy shootacross the sky as the force field is disrupted. Starbuck and Boomer make their way vipers while ensuing in a laser gun fight with the Cylons. They are just about outnumbered, and about had it when Apollo, already in his grounded viper, activates his lasers, turns his viper, and fires on the entire Cylon army, blowing them to bits while still on the ground. ( This will make for a dramatic build-up to the final climatic sequence. )<p>
As all of this is taking place, a Cylon basestar is hovering low, almost in the planets atmosphere. (This is the same basestar that the Galactica signals picked up earlier in the story. It was originally on it's way to this planet to investigate the capturing of the humans. )<p>
Suddenly, achain reaction from the energy force field going haywire causes the baseship scanners to malfunction. Almost in a reverse mode, the energy force field pulls the basestar towards the main energy structure, in the center of the city...<p>

The vipers launch just in time as the basestar comes crashing down into the city, creating an enormous explosion. Apollo and gang head back to the Galactica. The Colonials will now have a limited time to get what they need before Cylon reinforcements arrive.
