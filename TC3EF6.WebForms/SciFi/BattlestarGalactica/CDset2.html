<H2>I. Introduction by Co-Producer Ford A. Thaxton</H2>

The Stu Phillips Battlestar Galactica Anthology is a promotional
four-disc set done for the composer's use.<P>

The disc is taken from Stu's own tapes and overall the sound is pretty
damn good (IMHO of course). Stu wanted his music perserved in a manner he
was happy with and was very happy with the finished product.<P>

Only about 300 or 400 copies will be available from "The Usual Mail order
outlets" after that it's history.<P>

The box set features music from the Pilot film "Saga of a Star World", and
from such episodes as "War of the Gods-pts. 1 &amp;2", "Gun on Ice Planet
Zero-Pts. 1 &amp;2","The Living Legend Pts. 1 &amp; 2", "Lost Planet of the Gods
Pts. 1 &amp; 2","The Lost Warrior", "The Young Lords","The Magnifcent
Warriors", "The Long Patrol", and the final episode of the series "The
Hand of God".<P>

All of Stu Phillip's score that appeared on the original LP release is
featured on disc one, but it's from the soundtrack recording that you
hear in the show. Portions were re-recorded due to some major sound
problems during the first sessions for the show and were used instead of
what you hear in the finished program.<P>

The set includes both the feature version of the Main Title as well as the
weekly series version, also included the Main Title (and a alternate
version) of the "Galactica 1980".<P>

<H2>V. About Stu Phillips</H2>

Stu Phillips has enjoyed a career spanning several aspects of the music
industry. He trained as a composer at the Eastman School of Music for
three years and also studied at the High School of Music and Art, now
known as the LaGuardia School of the Performing Arts. From 1960 to 1978
he was an A&amp;R producer for Colpix Records, Capitol Records and Epic
Records. Stu produced and arranged three #1 gold records <I>Blue Moon</I>,
<I>Goodbye Cruel World</I> and <I>Johnny Angel</I>.<P>

In 1972 he first worked with Glen Larson on the pilot episode of <I>The
Six Million Dollar Man</I>. Says Stu, "Glen called Bob Simard and asked for
a list of recommended composers. Glen noticed my name on the list and
asked if this guy Stu Phillips was the same man who produced for Capitol
Records. Glen then immediately called me to write music for <I>The Six
Million Dollar Man</I>." It was the beginning of a teaming that would last
for over 14 years and span many popular series including <I>Battlestar:
Galactica</I> and other shows such as <I>Quincy</I>, <I>The Hardy Boys and Nancy
Drew Mysteries</I>, <I>Buck Rogers In The 25th Century</I>, <I>The Fall Guy</I>,
<I>Knight Rider</I>, <I>Manimal</I> and others. Stu currently resides in Studio
City and continues to write music.<P>
