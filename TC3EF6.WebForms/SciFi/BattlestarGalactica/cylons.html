The following are excerpts for several entries pertaining to Cylons, as
published in "Encyclopedia Galactica: From the Fleet Library aboard the
Battlestar Galactica".

<h2>CYLON</h2>

The original Cylons were a technologically advanced reptilian race from a
far corner of the galaxy. As they died out a millennia ago, little is known
of their society. They must have been warlike and imperialistic since at
the time of their extinction they had already conquered hundreds of other
worlds. The key to the success of the early Cylon's conquests was their
development, first of sophisticated robots, and then of fully intelligent
androids. These machines were build to withstand enormous stress and to
have great strength and powerful computational capacity. Armies of them
swept through sector after sector of the galaxy. But ultimately, the
machines became the superiors of their creators, and the Cylons themselves
were destroyed by their own machines.<p>

The Cylon androids, reptilian in form like their masters, continued the
mission of destruction to which they had been assigned. Machines that they
were, they swept through the galaxy even more ruthlessly than their
creators. The directives of their programming crystallized into a single
Edict of Extermination, that called for the destruction of all intelligent
life forms in the Galaxy.<p>

The Cylons have occasionally combined forces with beings like the Ovions,
but few creatures are more useful to the Cylons alive than dead. Therefore,
the number of members of the Cylon Alliance is likely to remain small.
Cylons have no concept of friendship of loyalty, and are programmed to
exterminate their living allies at the earliest convenient date.<p>

Modern Cylons are basically humanform. The most common type is the
Centurion, a heavily armored soldier capable of operating a Raider and
piloting a Baseship, and also adaptable to planetary invasion and
extermination. They are not of high intelligence, but can be cheaply
mass-produced. A common Cylon strategy, therefore, is to overwhelm the
enemy with large number of Centurions, many of whom will be destroyed,
leaving a sufficient number of survivors to carry the day.<p>

The most advanced Cylons are from the I-L Series. Both Lucifer, aide to
Commander Baltar, and the Imperious Leader itself are of this type. I-L
series Cylons have acute reasoning abilities, and can directly monitor
electronic telemetry from up to fifty sources simultaneously. Much more
than simple automatons, the I-L's at times exhibit humanlike drives for
power. Human cylonologists speculate that this ambition response was
deliberately programmed into the I-L's to insure prompt replacement of
incompetent leadership.<p>

The first human-Cylon contact occurred a thousand yahren ago, when combined
human forces came to the defense of their allies, the Hasaris. The humans
were unprepared for the massive Cylon offensive, and their fleet was soon
forced back to the outer defense perimeters of their own Colonies. This was
the beginning of the thousand-yahren Great Cylon War.<p>

The humans proved to be the most formidable foes the Cylons had ever faced.
Lacking imagination to respond to human advances creatively, the Cylons
adapted in the only way they could: by imitation. The Centurions were
designed to resemble humans more and more, and their weapons were
redesigned accordingly. Human weapons advances were quickly met by Cylon
copies, so that the war remained in stalemate for hundreds of yahren. The
Colonial Unification Movement and the military genius of Commander Cain had
pushed the Cylons to the breaking point, when the treachery of Baltar led
to the near-final destruction of humanity.<p>

<h2>IMPERIOUS LEADER</h2>

An I-L series Cylon known as the Imperious Leader commands the vast Cylon
Empire. Although the other I-L series Cylons treat the Imperious Leader
with great respect, all secretly aspire to its role. No orderly means of
succession has been developed; if an Imperious Leader show weakness, it is
replaced by whatever Cylon unit has the power to eliminate it.<p>

The first Imperious Leader engineered the overthrow of the reptilian
Cylons. Today, of all Cylons, only the Imperious Leader retains reptilian
form.<p>

<h2>BALTAR</h2>

Baltar is without a doubt the most hated human in Colonial history. His
greed and lust for power led him to deceive his fellow Councilors into
relaxing their defenses, opening the door to the massive Cylon offensive in
which at least seventy billion humans perished. The Cylon Imperious Leader
promised Baltar safety for his own Colony, and personal rulership over the
rest of humankind. Baltar, in return, persuaded the Quorum of the Twelve
that the Cylons were sincerely interested in peace, and that they had
already shut down most of their attack forces in a gesture of friendship.
The humans then disabled most of their weapons.<p>

Baltar, himself, was betrayed by the Cylons, who attacked all twelve
colonies equally. Furthermore, their goal was not the enslavement of the
human race under the dictatorship of Baltar, but rather the elimination of
every human being from the galaxy. It was too late then for Baltar to
return to the humans. The Cylons gave Baltar a choice between helping them
complete their mission against the humans or slow death under torture.
Baltar cast his lot with the Cylons, and appears now to enjoy his new rank
of Commander of a Cylon Baseship. Although Baltar is not an inspired
strategist by human standards, his imagination and knowledge of human
nature make him indispensable to the Cylon Empire.
