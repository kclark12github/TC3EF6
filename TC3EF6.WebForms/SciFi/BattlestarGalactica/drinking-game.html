<H1>Battlestar Galactica Drinking Game</H1>
<H2>(a.k.a. Picking Nits in the Fleet)</H2>

<H3>Rules:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>One "drink" is one sip.
<LI>Two- and three-part episodes are counted as separate episodes. Exceptions to this are: The movie or three-hour ABC pilot version of the first three episodes and the original two-hour ABC version of "Greetings from Earth."</UL>

<I>WARNING!: This is one of the more deadlier drinking games ever devised, guaranteed to knock you blotto after a half-hour. We suggest using a non-alcoholic beverage if you don't want to hate yourself the next day. Or better yet, simply read and enjoy.</I><p><hr>

<p>

<H4>Three drinks</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Rigel says something other than "Transferring control to all vipers. Launch when ready."
<LI>Every time Athena appears more than once in an episode after "War of the Gods."
<LI>Whenever you notice that Athena has inexplicably changed profession, though it lasts for exactly one episode. (Continuity? We don't need no stinkin' continuity!)
<LI>When you realize Athena probably kept her day job because she was so rotten at the new one. (To a bunch of 5-year-olds: "That's because they are in something called 'suspended animation.' Can any of you tell me what that is?")
<LI>You actually see Starbuck romancing a woman (Cassiopea does not count) AFTER "The Living Legend."
<LI>Adama says something mysterious that goes completely over everyone's head.
<LI>Boxey actually does something useful.
<LI>Whenever same stock footage is used more than once in an episode. (The three drinks is for consolation. Watch the wrong episode, you could get plastered. Make it three small drinks.)
<LI>Starbuck makes a joke and Apollo takes him seriously enough to run with the idea.
<LI>You see Omega somewhere other than behind the big rotating console on the bridge.
<LI>Starbuck goes along with Apollo, even if his opinion is totally different as expressed elsewhere in the same episode.
<LI>A character who is not mentioned in the opening credits and not the special guest star has a significant role in the episode.
<LI>Whenever some non-Cylon (discounting Baltar, who probably is a Cylon cleverly disguised as a human being) is in league with the Cylons.
<LI>We get to see a different uniform other than the duty or dress uniforms of the warriors, bridge personnel and security officers. (Remember those cool leather jumpsuits?)
<LI>Boomer loses his temper.
<LI>Tigh loses his temper.
<LI>Athena loses her temper.
<LI>Apollo reacts emotionally to a situation, despite the fact that everyone else is being rational about it.
<LI>Any male colonial warrior seen in civilian clothes. (The triad uniform does not count.)
<LI>The title of the episode doesn't even match the plot. (e.g., "Greetings from Earth")
<LI>We see Cassiopea wearing that little red number she was wearing when she first came aboard the Galactica as a socialator.
<LI>Someone's past (other than Starbuck) from before the Destruction is actually explored, no matter how slightly.
<LI>Apollo has a vague shot at "getting the girl" after Serina dies.
<LI>Apollo actually kisses someone.
<LI>Boxey joins Our Heroes on a mission to a planet.
<LI>Any episode that looks like it belongs on "Bonanza," Cylons and other weird aliens not withstanding.
<LI>Every time you see Starbuck and Athena actually kiss. On the mouth. Pecks on the cheek do not count.
<LI>Someone is clear about what all those time units (micron, centon, secton, etc.) mean.
<LI>Someone comes out and asks Our Heroes what these time units mean.
<LI>You see a close-up Bojay or Greenbean or any other pilot besides Our Heroes (Starbuck, Boomer, Apollo, Sheba) in the cockpits of their vipers.
<LI>Apollo refers to Adama as "Commander."
<LI>Athena calls Adama "Father" at an inappropriate time. (I.e., while working on the bridge.)
<LI>Starbuck disobeys Apollo's orders.
<LI>Any reference is made to Starbuck being thought of as a son by Adama.
<LI>Dr. Wilker suddenly turns into a complete git, even though he seems pretty nice in every other episode in which he appears. (Ya'll know the episode we're talking about)
<LI>Warning! Complicated rule with bonus drinks ahead. A one-shot character, who allegedly has a long history with one of the main characters, comes out of nowhere, throwing the whole known history of the character in doubt. Take four MORE drinks if the character was believed to be dead. Take ANOTHER five drinks if it was obvious that the one-shot character was created for a "name" guest star. Take ANOTHER six drinks if the main character in question is NOT Starbuck. (Warning: Watching "The Living Legend" will get you totally smashed under this rule since Commander Cain counts for 18 drinks)
</UL><p>
<H4>Four drinks</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Any line that makes you say, "Did I really just hear that?" (Those of you who have seen "Lost Planet of the Gods" can envision what we're talking about.)
<LI>Boomer disobeys (or tries to) Apollo's orders.
<LI>Someone OTHER than Starbuck or Apollo has to make a forced landing on a planet. (We know. It never happens. But, we can always hope.)
<LI>The Ship of Lights plays Deus ex Machina.
<LI>Baltar actually helps someone, either by accident or on purpose.
<LI>Starbuck actually WINS a card game.
<LI>Starbuck's winning the card game lands him in even deeper felgercarb.
<LI>Starbuck mentions "the m-word." (Sealing in Galacticese.)
<LI>Apollo (or anyone else) refers to Serina by name or obliquely after her death.
<LI>Starbuck sees a pretty woman and he does not immediately make advances.
<LI>Every time you see Jolly in any episode for more than one scene.
<LI>Anytime someone actually announces Jolly's rank.
<LI>Bojay is mentioned after "The Living Legend."
<LI>Boomer has any meaningful interactions with a member of the opposite sex.
<LI>Whenever you notice any of the actors looking in the "wrong" direction. (e.g., during a conversation they suddenly glance in another direction as if they were distracted or are reading cue cards before looking back again.)
<LI>The second you realize that any Cylon basestar that does not have Baltar on it shouldn't have oxygen on it either. (Kinda blows "Hand of God" outa the water, donnent it?)
<LI>You realize that a Cylon colony should not have food supplies on it that a roving battlestar could use to feed its crew. (Kinda blows the Pegasus' reasons for raiding Gomorray outa the water, too.)</UL><p>

<H4>Five drinks</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Someone even makes a vague reference to Cassiopea's former profession AFTER she becomes a medtech.
<LI>Someone actually explains within the episodes WHY and HOW Cassiopea became a medtech overnight. (Only the network censors know for sure.)
<LI>You actually see one of those battle jackets buttoned. (We dare you to find even one fastener closed.)
<LI>You actually hear someone, or something, SINGING.
<LI>You hear Starbuck call Apollo "captain."
<LI>You hear Apollo call Starbuck "lieutenant."
<LI>Whenever a backdrop is clearly generated by a rear projection screen instead of actually "being there." (Five sips is consolation for bad special effects.)
