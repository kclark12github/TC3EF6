        <p align="center"><font size="3"><em>Tales from the
        Nightside</em> is a collection of macabre stories by
        Charles L. Grant. I accepted a commission to do the cover
        art in the gloomy winter of 1980-81. There had been
        recent deaths in my family and among friends; the weather
        was bleak; John Lennon had been shot, and so on. Closing
        my eyes, all I could visualize was a spot of red on a
        deep, dark velvety black.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="3">The first material that
        came to hand were pastels, so I drew the art directly
        onto black pastel paper. Unfortunately, black pastel
        paper looks dark gray under photo lights, so the
        reproduction wouldn't have been faithful to my original
        idea. The absolute velvety blackness was essential. In
        the end, I repainted the whole thing in acrylics, <em>over</em>
        the pastel rendering.</font></p>
