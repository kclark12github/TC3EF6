        <p>When I was contacted for this assignment, a cover
        painting for <em>Golden Witchbreed</em>, by Mary Gentle,
        the publishers balked at my fee. Uncharacteristically, I
        chatted them up a bit by telling them I would do them one
        of my &quot;best pieces of work to date&quot; and that
        &quot;the book would sell great&quot; as a result. They
        went for it. The reason I had asked for a steep fee in
        the first place was that they needed the finished piece
        in a hurry, and I knew that accepting the commission
        would mean working 'round the clock until it was done.</p>
        <p>After reading the manuscript, developing a concept,
        and working on the painting for a while, I had to admit
        that my efforts were doomed. I hadn't though the approach
        through adequately, and it was time to face the fact that
        I would have to start over.</p>
        <p>When I called the client to tell them this (probably
        the worst phone call I ever had to make), they wouldn't
        accept my word for it. &quot;Are you sure you're not just
        being overly picky?&quot; they asked. &quot;Why don't you
        sent it to us and let us decide.&quot;</p>
        <p>I sent it in. Soon after, they called me and said,
        &quot;You're right. Better start over.&quot; (In terms of
        my careers, one of the worst calls I ever received!) It
        was then that I realized what was missing from the first
        attempt was an element that would tie the composition
        together. Re-reading the manuscript gave me a key clue:
        the aliens all had six fingers. I began to think about an
        alien numbering system based on the number six, and the
        image of a hexagon sprang to mind. I realized then that
        the interaction between human and alien was the most
        significant plot aspect and I was on my way at last.</p>
