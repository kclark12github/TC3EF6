        <p><font size="3">Unlike a lot of other series for which
        I've painted cover art, the Fuzzy books were well spaced,
        so I didn't have to do them on a regular basis. It always
        seemed that a new Fuzzy book would need a cover just as I
        had finished some dreadful horror painting. The timing
        was good; the change of mood was welcome. Of course,
        after doing such cute stuff I'd have to get into another
        &quot;serious&quot; concept of the next work, to balance
        things out!</font></p>
