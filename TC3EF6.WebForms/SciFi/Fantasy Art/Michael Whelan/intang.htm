        <p><font size="3">This painting is one I wanted to do for
        myself. When I got a call in regard to the book project,
        an Arthur C. Clarke short story collection titled <em>Tales
        from Planet Earth</em>, I told the client that I had
        already set aside the month to work on a personal
        project. He was interested in seeing if the painting
        could be made to work as a cover to the book, and indeed
        it all worked out. The only glitch was a little
        submarine/spaceship object that had to be included. It
        was needed to make the painting work as a cover for the
        book, but I wanted to keep the egg in the painting. My
        answer was to paint the spacecraft on removable tape.
        When I got the painting back I peeled off the ship and
        restored the piece to its intended state.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">In the interim, the book company
        decided that their transparencies weren't good enough. I
        sent the art to them to reshoot, and the next day someone
        called me up to say, &quot;Where's the ship? It seems to
        have turned into an egg!&quot;</font></p>
