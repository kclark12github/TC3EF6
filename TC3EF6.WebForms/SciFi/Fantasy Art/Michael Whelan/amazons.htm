        Art of Michael Whelan</u></strong></h3>
        <p><font size="3">Although covers for anthologies don't
        pay well, they offer as close to complete freedom as a
        book cover commission can get. Usually I only have to
        come up with an image that communicates the theme tying
        the stories together, and then run with it. This makes it
        much easier to realize my oft-stated goal of creating a
        work that both satisfies the requirements of the
        publisher and expresses my own artistic themes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">This painting for the anthology <em>Amazons</em>
        was the first cover in which I deliberately set out to
        use a symbolic element. In this case, the moon: a symbol
        (and source?) of feminine spirit and strength.</font></p>
