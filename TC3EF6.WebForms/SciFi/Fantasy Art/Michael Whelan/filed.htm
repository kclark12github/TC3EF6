        <p><font size="3">Ace Books contacted me about doing a
        cover painting for one of a two-book series: <em>Dragons
        of Light</em> and <em>Dragons of Darkness</em>. My art
        was to be for the second volume. The book was an
        anthology, but I chose to depict a specific scene from
        one of the stories because it was appropriately gloomy
        and lent itself to the suggestion in the title very well.
        I completed the painting-- if I ever have to paint that
        many dragon scales again I'll commit ritual suicide--
        delivered the piece, and bent my mind to the next task. I
        forgot about it until a proof copy arrived in my mailbox:
        <em>Dragons of Light</em> had been published, but with my
        painting on the cover. The first artist had missed his
        deadline, so they put my cover on the book instead. this
        prompted a few fans to comment to me, &quot;If this is <em>Dragons
        of Light</em>, what will <em>Dragons of Darkness</em>
        look like? All black?&quot;</font></p>
