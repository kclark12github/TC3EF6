        Michael Whelan</u></h3>
        <p><font size="3">In April 1992, my family and I went
        traveling in Australia. During the trip I realized how
        much my daughter had grown and how fast she would be
        changing from that point on. It's a wonderful but
        bittersweet emotion, strange and hard to grasp, yes
        subtly shocking when the realization suddenly comes into
        focus as it did on our climb up Australia's most famous
        natural monument.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Up on Ayers Rock, I felt Alexa and I
        were poised in time between Alexa's childhood and the
        rest of her life. While on the top, someone dropped a
        handkerchief, which the strong wind immediately carried
        away. Sailing off, first seen against the blue sky, and
        then falling against the vermilion rock faces, I felt
        what I was experiencing was a sublime vision perfectly
        timed to coincide with my thoughts and emotions. Later,
        with this painting I attempted to pull it all together in
        one image.</font></p>
