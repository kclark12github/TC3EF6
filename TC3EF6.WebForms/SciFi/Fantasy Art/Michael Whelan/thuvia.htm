        another one of the Barsoomian beasts that was basically
        an Earthly one with more legs. To portray the <em>banth</em>
        (Barsoomian &quot;lion&quot;) in all his fierceness
        without having him look silly, I curved his body around
        in such a way as to make his multileggedness less
        apparent. I also had to be careful in doing Thuvia
        herself, as everyone on Barsoom goes nude, and yet
        full-frontal nudity was unacceptable for the cover. By
        turning her away from the viewer, I thought I had this
        problem solved, but Lester del Rey had me add the
        G-string just to be on the safe side. The rest of the
        painting is in acrylics, but I did that G-string in
        gouache in case I ever get the urge to wipe it off. </font></p>
