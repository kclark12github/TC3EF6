        Art of Michael Whelan</u></strong></h3>
        <p align="center"><font size="3">The biggest challenge in
        painting alien creatures is in finding ways to
        communicate information about the way they think, via the
        gestures available to their peculiar forms. Of course the
        more humanoid the alien creatures, the easier the job,
        for everyone has an innate knowledge of the subtleties of
        human nonverbal expression. With non-human creatures
        though, this can lead to misinterpretations. Take chimps,
        for example-- they seem to smile when they are afraid and
        yawn when they are feeling aggressive. If aliens were to
        meet us humans, even if they were to have humanoid forms,
        the chances are that each other's expressions would cause
        both species considerable confusion.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="3">However, in the world of
        illustration, my goal is to communicate something of the
        aliens' nature to the viewer. Since my audience is made
        up of humans, it is fitting for me to use the human
        library of gesture to convey my point. Such is the case
        here, in my painting for the novel <em>Chanur's
        Homecoming</em>, by C.J. Cherryh. </font></p>
