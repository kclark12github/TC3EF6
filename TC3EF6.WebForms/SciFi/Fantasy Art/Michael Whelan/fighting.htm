        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since I was endeavoring to
        be the illustrator most faithful to Burroughs'
        descriptions, Lester del Rey and I had a lengthy
        discussion about whether the white lizard I wanted to
        show had six or eight legs. The Barsoomian counterparts
        to four-legged creatures on Earth always had eight legs,
        but Burroughs specifically described the white lizard as
        having only six. We could not decide if this was his
        mistake, or if Burroughs intended to have six legs
        because it had spent its life in isolation in the cave.
        But the author wrote six, so I painted six. </font></p>
