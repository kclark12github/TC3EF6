        Heinlein does create memorable characters! Not even
        halfway through this book I had a nearly photographic
        image of Friday in my mind. By the time I was finished
        reading I felt confident about the substance and approach
        my painting would have. It is Friday's character that
        dominates the story; I felt, then, that Friday front and
        center should dominate the cover. The attendant details
        support her and hint at the other aspects: The planet
        where she settles down in the end (center of which is at
        her heart), the egg-shaped window (motherhood), and, of
        course, the zipper pulls (her vibrant sexuality).<br>
        <br>
        Upon exhibiting the painting I received numerous requests
        for the model's phone number. While I did pose someone in
        a jumpsuit to study the fabric and folds, the face and
        figure are from my imagination and Mr. Heinlein's! </font></p>
