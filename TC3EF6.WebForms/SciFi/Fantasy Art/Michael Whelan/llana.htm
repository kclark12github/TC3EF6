        did the eleven books over the course of a year, as time
        went on some things became less important. This time we
        did not worry about the title of the book, and Llana
        herself does not even appear in my painting. I realized
        that after doing nine covers I still had not shown one of
        the unique Barsoomian airships so commonly featured
        throughout the series. To tell the truth, I felt there
        was little point in doing so, since Robert Abbett had
        done such a great job visualizing them on the covers he
        painted for the books in the 1960s. Nevertheless, this
        scene involved an airship and also conveyed the feeling
        of the book very well. </font></p>
