        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Some come easy, some
        come hard,&quot; said Norman Rockwell, when someone asked
        him how long it took for him to complete a painting. Like
        him, I'm somewhat of a perfectionist. Often, after I've
        made my plans, it takes me twice as many work hours as I
        allotted to complete an assignment. It's hard to stay
        awake into the late nights week after week; one of the
        ways I keep going is by listening to recorded books. When
        I'm almost through a painting, just rendering
        embellishments and details, I enjoy listening to the
        tapes-- as I did while completing this cover painting for
        Melanie Rawn's <i>The Star Scroll</i>. This practice has
        a long and honorable history: such luminaries as Rockwell
        and even Leonardo himself employed people to read to them
        while they painted. </font></p>
