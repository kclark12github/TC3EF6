        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">All the concepts I
        submitted for the 1982 <i>Year's Best Horror Stories</i>
        cover were strong. If I had tried to guess which one
        would be chosen, the one that became this painting would
        have been my <i>last</i> guess. But Don Wollheim saw the
        possibilities in the concept better than I did and
        selected it to develop for the cover.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For an allegory on the use
        of opium and its derivatives, specifically heroin, I
        posed the Angel of Death amid a field of poppies,
        offering a false mask of friendship. He is accompanied by
        diverse symbols and various accouterments of the drug
        user. He wears on his head a single wing, representing
        false freedom of thought and the illusion of flight, and
        he wears a crown of Destroying Angel mushrooms. The tree
        is meant to suggest the dendritic branching of blood
        vessels, but it is withered. And the background consists
        of a purple haze-- a reference to the reason I got to
        ruminating on the whole subject to begin with, the death
        of Jimi Hendrix.</font></p>
