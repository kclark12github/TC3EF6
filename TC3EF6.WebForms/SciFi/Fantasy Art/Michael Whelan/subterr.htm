        <p><font size="3">My original conception of the image
        didn't seem right somehow, and I had been wondering how I
        could improve on it. While attending my daughter's winter
        music concert at her school, the answer came to me and I
        could see it in my mind's eye. Fortunately I had a little
        pad of paper and a pencil in my pocket on which to sketch
        it while it was still fresh in my mind.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The perspective is false. For some
        reason whenever I tried to make the picture do what I
        wanted it to do via the conventional laws of perspective,
        it lost something vital, the feeling of curving immensity
        going on forever. So I chucked what I've learned about
        true perspective and painted it the way it felt right.</font></p>
