        Art of Michael Whelan</u></strong></h3>
        <p>I love doing covers for anthologies, and I especially
        enjoy doing covers for horror anthologies. This piece was
        commissioned for one of DAW Books' annual collections of <em>The
        Year's Best Horror Stories</em>.</p>
        <p>This painting was pure fun. I had always wanted to do
        a boogeyman, and had submitted the idea to DAW Books
        years earlier for a previous cover. It wasn't chosen, but
        I kept the sketch and resubmitted it with other concepts
        every year after that, until it was finally chosen for
        this anthology.</p>
        <p>Someday I'll paint the boogeyman I imagined when I was
        young, which I still remember. As funny as it sounds, he
        was shaped like a big turkey drumstick!</p>
