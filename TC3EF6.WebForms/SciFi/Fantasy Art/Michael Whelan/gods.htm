        </strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is
        one of my favorite books in the series, and there were
        many scenes I could have chosen to illustrate. I selected
        this scene from the fist chapter because it is so full of
        action, in contrast to the statuesque grandeur of the
        cover scene on </font><a href="princess.htm"><font
        size="2" face="Arial"><em>A Princess of Mars</em></font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial">.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I'd like to do it over. In
        spite of my enthusiasm then, I think I would do a much
        better job at depicting the scene now. In retrospect, I
        believe I was thrown by two factors inherent in
        Burrough's narrative. First, the plant men are described
        as &quot;hideous,&quot; &quot;ghoulish,&quot; and
        &quot;awful travesties of nature.&quot; In an attitude of
        self-censorship, I was reluctant to paint them too
        hideous, knowing that the image would be used as a book
        cover. Since Lester del Rey certainly gave me free rein
        to be as accurate as possible, in retrospect I don't know
        why I assumed such an attitude. Second, I felt
        overwhelmed by Burroughs' florid descriptions of the
        visual aspects of the scene-- everything was a brilliant
        color of one sort or another and in attempting to portray
        the scene as described I lost any feeling for balance or
        unity in the color scheme. All things considered, I'm
        looking forward to someday having the opportunity for a
        second try. </font></p>
