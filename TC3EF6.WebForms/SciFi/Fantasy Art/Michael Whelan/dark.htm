        <p><font size="3">The winter months of 1980-81 were
        tough. My wife and I became parents with the arrival of
        our daughter in November, and I needn't tell anyone who
        has children what that means in terms of life-style
        changes... like lack of sleep. A number of coincident
        upsets and tragedies seemed to beset us then, as well, in
        addition to a fairly heavy workload and miserably cold
        weather.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Set against the background was the
        commission to fully illustrate one of the most
        unremittingly bleak (though engaging) Stephen King novels
        I've ever read, The Dark Tower. If the book hadn't been
        so interesting, it would have been hard to maintain my
        enthusiasm through the completion of the work. </font></p>
