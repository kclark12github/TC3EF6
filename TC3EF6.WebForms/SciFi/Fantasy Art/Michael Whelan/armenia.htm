        Art of Michael Whelan</u></strong></h3>
        <p><font size="3">This painting is part of a series
        dealing with what Barbara Tuchman describes as the
        disillusionments of twentieth-century man. Among the most
        crushing of these is the death of two cherished notions:
        that of progress and that of perfectibility of mankind.
        Man of the symbolic elements in the painting are derived
        from aspects of and variations on that theme.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">However, as is usual with my art in
        general and my personal works in particular, this
        painting is also a confluence of thoughts, themes,
        symbols, and feelings. Therefore it has a number of
        layers of meaning for me. For example, on one level it is
        a reaction to the naive futurism underlying the pristine
        &quot;floating city&quot; cliché so often seen in SF
        art. The creators of those works never seem to take
        account of unchanging human nature: I always wonder where
        the graffiti, the police, and the litter are-- the
        negative aspects of society as it is and probably ever
        will be.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The title refers to a song recorded by
        The Who.</font></p>
