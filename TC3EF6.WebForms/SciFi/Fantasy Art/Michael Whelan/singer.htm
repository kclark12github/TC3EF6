        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">Most of my
        sketches for this cover dealt with the interrelationship
        between the protagonist Killashandra and the black
        crystals she has a special affinity for.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">Unlike my
        other concepts for this book, this scene features the
        Killashandra front and center in an emotionally charged
        scene where she is transported into a sort of harmonic
        ecstasy via the black crystal. The pose is interesting in
        its own right and, in fact, proved to be something of a
        challenge to the model I hired. As the position was
        extremely difficult to maintain, we resorted to
        photography in order to capture it in detail. Even so,
        she held the pose for a remarkably long time, and I
        imagine she had some stiff muscles the following day!</font></p>
