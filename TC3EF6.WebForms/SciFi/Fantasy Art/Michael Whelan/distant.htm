        <p align="center">I was stuck for a while as I tried to
        come up with a design structure to unify the elements I
        wanted to include in this composition. Later I was
        driving on a highway and as I passed beneath a bridge, I
        glimpsed two yellow and black caution markings on the
        concrete pillars on either side of the road. That was it.</p>
        <p align="center">When I was commissioned to do the art
        for the cover to this anthology, I was told I could have
        all the freedom I wanted. I came up with several concepts
        inspired by my meditations ont he title <em>Distant Stars</em>,
        but they were all rather metaphysical in feeling and the
        clients were unimpressed. Instead, they gave me a sketch
        of the idea <em>they</em> wanted: on the front cover, a
        spacesuited man coming through a porthole; on the back, a
        woman in a diaphanous gown, &quot;waiting for her man to
        come home.&quot;</p>
        <p align="center">This is what they got. Maybe someday
        the woman will get on the front cover. </p>
