        Michael Whelan</u></h3>
        <p><font size="3">Unlike most of my works, I painted this
        image for the cover of Michael Moorcock's <i>The
        Vanishing Tower</i> without the benefit of a detailed
        preliminary concept. My primary guideline was a rough
        charcoal sketch. Though I was pleased with the final
        painting, I was dismayed to realized that the sketch had
        more of a sense of movement than the finished piece.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">I puzzled over the problem for some
        time before I saw the answer. In the painting, the shape
        formed by the two combatants is a triangle with its base
        on the ground plane: the most stable and solid shape of
        all. When I reexamined the sketch, I saw that I had used
        a vaguely triangular shape, but the base was tilted,
        creating a subtle but effective unbalanced feeling more
        in keeping with the scene.</font></p>
