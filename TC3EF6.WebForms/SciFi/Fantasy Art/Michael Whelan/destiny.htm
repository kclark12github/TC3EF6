        <p>After doing six painted concepts in an effort to
        distill Larry Niven's novel <em>Destiny's Road</em> into
        one image, I settled on a mountaintop perspective that
        gave me the chance to offer an aerial view of the road
        and its environs. The publisher agreed and I went to work
        on the finished piece; but upon rereading the material, I
        realized that I have the view wrong. If I followed
        Niven's text to the letter, it would be impossible to
        view the road from the angle I had chosen. Back to the
        drawing board! I labored to make a corrected color sketch
        that offered an analogous scene that was literally
        correct and sent it to the publisher. But the art
        director and publisher said the mistake didn't bother
        them-- they liked the first version better.
        Compositionally, I did too... so here is the painting as
        conceived in the original concept.</p>
        <p>The painting may eventually turn out to be true to the
        novel after all. It wasn't finished at the time I painted
        the cover illustration, so I worked from sample chapters,
        Niven's detailed notes about the story, and, in
        particular, his commentaries on virtually every important
        aspect of the science and history of the planet. When
        Larry saw the painting on display at the 1992 World
        Science Fiction Convention art show, he liked it. Maybe
        it will influence him to make a change here and there so
        that the art will be one hundred percent true to the text
        after all.</p>
