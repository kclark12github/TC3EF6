        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">When
        Judy-Lynn del Rey asked me to do this assignment she
        said, &quot;What we're looking for here is a 'big book'
        look.&quot; I had only a vague idea of what she meant
        (except that &quot;big books&quot; usually do not feature
        narrative cover art), but I know that the painting I
        created would have to be different from most others I had
        done. it was my first Clarke cover, and as 2001 is one of
        my all-time favorites I thought that 2010 would be a joy
        to do.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">It didn't
        turn out that way. I ended up having to do ten comps
        instead of the usual two to four because of Ballantine's
        reluctance to leave any detail to chance in the marketing
        of such a potential bestseller. Also, I decided to give
        the painting a more diffuse, soft-edged quality than I
        usually want, and this necessitated using an airbrush,
        which I tend to dislike. Nevertheless, I was pleased with
        the final result.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">An
        interesting note: in one of those comps I mentioned, I
        placed the ship at an angle over the Star Child's hands.
        At a science-fiction convention where I had it on
        display, someone complimented me on the inspiration of
        portraying the Discovery spacecraft as the Star Child's
        baby rattle. I thanked him, but to be honest, though it
        was an interesting concept it was altogether
        unintentional!</font></p>
