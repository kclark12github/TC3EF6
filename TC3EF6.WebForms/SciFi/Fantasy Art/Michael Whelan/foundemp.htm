        size="2" face="Arial">Once again there was a clear choice
        for the central subject of this cover painting: the
        clownish &quot;Mule,&quot; the one variable Seldon
        overlooked in his massive plan. outwardly a buffoon, the
        Mule is the greatest concentration of power in a single
        individual in the Galaxy, and thus threatens to undo
        generations of Foundation efforts to restore peace.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In this scene, hopeful
        dawn gives way to harsh light of midday. The once stately
        columns of the Empire now lean crazily in broken
        disarray. Perching over the scene like a comic vulture is
        the Mule. He is gaudily clad in his harlequin outfit, but
        his eyes reflect his tragic character and his Achilles
        heel-- his love for Bayta-- is symbolized by the bright
        pink cloth tied to his leg.</font></p>
