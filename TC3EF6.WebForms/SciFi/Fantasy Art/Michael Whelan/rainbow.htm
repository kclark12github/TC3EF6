        <p><font size="3">The surface meaning of my
        &quot;Passage&quot; concept is technical in nature: I
        wish to develop my oil painting technique further so that
        I am more comfortable with the medium. It signifies a
        passage from working nearly exclusively in acrylics to
        attaining a greater technical flexibility in oils. In
        spite of the resolution, I painted this vision in
        acrylics because I saw the sky, in a dream, as looking
        very airbrushed and smooth. It would have been pointless
        travail, then, to try to capture the atmosphere in oils.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">In doing this painting, I altered some
        details from what I originally had in mind. I'm quite
        satisfied with it, but I think I'll eventually try to
        render the original vision more exactly.</font></p>
