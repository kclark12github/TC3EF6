        <p><font size="3">When I finished this painting it worked
        for me as a &quot;window into another world,&quot; but
        that was in the confines of my studio. When I displayed
        it at a show shortly thereafter, I was surprised to note
        how the painting was lost among a number of larger works.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">After the show I cleared a large area
        of wall space in order to determine an optimum size for
        future work. I stood away from the wall at about the same
        distance I usually put myself when viewing art in a good
        setting. Taking a long stick with a piece of charcoal on
        the end, I marked a square on the wall. That for me was
        the minimum-size painting I would work on henceforth...
        four feet on a side.</font></p>
