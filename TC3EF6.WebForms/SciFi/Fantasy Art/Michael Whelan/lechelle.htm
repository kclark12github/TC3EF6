        Michael Whelan</u></h3>
        <p><font size="3">An ad agency commissioned me to do a
        painting for a Waldenbooks promotion. The painting was to
        be used in a poster campaign, and the artwork itself was
        to be given away in a sweepstakes. Before I even started
        coming up with ideas, I agreed to sell the original art
        and all rights-- something I rarely do.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Then I started work on this painting.
        As I gradually arrived at this scene, I became more and
        more enamored of the thought behind it. A story evolved
        that was good enough to generate at least another
        painting or two. I could visualize the other works rising
        out of this one, then a book perhaps, even a movie, who
        knows!? I panicked: I had sold all the rights.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">I ended up buying back out of the
        contract enough rights to the painting to allow me the
        option of eventually developing the concepts further. For
        me, the &quot;free&quot; in &quot;freelance&quot; is all
        about self direction and keeping one's options open.</font></p>
