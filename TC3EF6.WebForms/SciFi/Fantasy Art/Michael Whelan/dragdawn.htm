        Michael Whelan</u></h3>
        <p><font size="3">I'm the kind of person who hates having
        projects hanging over his head. Before leaving on a trip
        I'll do everything possible to finish up my work so I can
        start fresh on something new when I return.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">This time, I resisted the impulse. I
        left for the 1987 World SF Convention in Brighton,
        England, with the painting for Anne McCaffrey's <em>Dragonsdawn</em>
        still in my studio. It seemed to be finished to me.
        Usually I would have a messenger take it out of my hands
        and deliver it to the publisher so I could leave with a
        free mind. But something held me back.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">One of our side trips in the U.K. was
        to the coast of Wales, and we were having a wonderful day
        at the spectacular Three Cliff's Bay. At one point, I
        walked out into the water and looked back to the shore.
        Instantly, a flaw in the painting that I'd left back home
        became apparent. I could see how the water should have
        been rendered in the painting. The way I had painted the
        scene-- not having a handy beach by my studio to study--
        wasn't as convincing. When I returned I repainted that
        part and <em>then </em>sent it in... with confidence.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">There's no substitute for studying the
        real thing.</font></p>
