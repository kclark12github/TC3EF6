        <p><font size="3">One cool, foggy morning I went to take
        pictures at the reservoir near my home. I was standing at
        the water's edge, and everything was dead silent. The
        water was a mysterious deep organic green color, and the
        air was so full of mist that the color of the water
        seemed to leach out, turn transparent, and fade to
        nothing before me. There were two ducks out there just
        beyond my range of vision; I could barely hear the subtle
        sound of their floating on the water. Then I noticed them
        smoothly gliding, moving in and out of the mist as if
        they knew exactly where the line was for me between
        perception and obscurity. Back and forth they drifted
        there on the water, in the silence, teasing me visually,
        looking for all the world like apparitions shimmering in
        and out of reality. It was a magical moment and the
        feeling inspired me when I was creating this painting.</font></p>
