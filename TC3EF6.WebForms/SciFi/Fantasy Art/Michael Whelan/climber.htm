        day I finished it I brought the painting to Audrey's
        frame shop to show it to her. She was busy with a client
        on a frame job, so I left the painting on a table and
        went to get some lunch. When I cam back I was rewarded
        with the sight of the client running her hand over the
        upper third of the painting to feel the texture of the
        surface... which, of course, isn't real but painted.</font></p>
