        </strong><em><strong>Michael Whelan's Works of Wonder</strong></em><strong>...
        </strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">For the
        first book in the series, it was important to me to do a
        painting that captured the feeling of the series as a
        whole: the otherworldliness of Barsoom and its two moons,
        the valor of its main hero, the weird and colorful
        life-forms, and the splendor of the civilization.<br>
        <br>
        To accurately portray the Tharks, the green men of
        Barsoom, I sculpted a model in olive-green Plasticene,
        using white plastic for the tusks. I so enjoyed working
        in a three-dimensional form that I kept the model long
        after the completion of the paintings for the series. In
        fact I kept it a little too long on a high shelf in my
        studio where it grew so much brown mold <br>
        that when it fell off and broke, I didn't try to repair
        it. </font></p>
