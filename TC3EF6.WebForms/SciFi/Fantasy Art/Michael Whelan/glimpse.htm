        size="3">The concept of &quot;prudence&quot; is an
        important theme to me. It doesn't refer to the modern
        notion of prudence with its uptight moralistic
        connotations. Instead, it hearkens to the classical
        notion of the virtue Prudence. That is, possession an
        accurate knowledge of and ability to learn from the past,
        a clear perception of the present and where current
        trends are leading, and the clarity of vision to foresee
        the results of one's actions.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The inference is that a person who has
        cultivated the virtue of prudence is a person who has
        learned from the past and acts in the present so as to
        ensure an ideal future.</font></p>
