        <p align="center"><font size="3">Patricia A. McKillip is
        a terrific writer, very inspiring. My cover concepts for
        her novel, <i>The Changeling Sea</i>, taken together,
        were some of the best I'd done up to that point. Choosing
        among them was extremely difficult. When the editors
        asked, &quot;Well, which one do you prefer?&quot; I
        didn't know what to say. I liked them all. Then I pointed
        out that other things being equal, the one with the
        largest face would probably be the most attractive on the
        bookstands, so that decided the issue. </font></p>
