        one of my favorite books in the series, but probably the
        least successful of the covers. My selection of yellow as
        a dominant color may be part of the reason for my
        dissatisfaction with the painting, as it's my least
        favorite color. Also, if I were to do it over I would
        repose the figures and do a better job of painting them.
        As usual though, I couldn't see any of these problems
        when I was working on the painting! </font></p>
