        Whelan's Works of Wonder...</strong></em></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;I am
        glad that you are here with me,&quot; said Frodo.
        &quot;Here at the end of all things, Sam.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Yes,
        I am with you, Master,&quot; said Sam, laying Frodo's
        wounded hand gently on his breast. &quot;And you're with
        me. And the journey's finished. But after coming all that
        way I don't want to give up yet. It's not like me,
        somehow, if you understand.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Maybe
        not, Sam,&quot; said Frodo; &quot;but it's like things
        are in the world. Hopes fail. An end comes. We have only
        a little time to wait now. We are lost in ruin and
        downfall, and there is no escape.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Well,
        Master, we could at least go further from this dangerous
        place here, from this Crack of Doom, if that's its name.
        Now couldn't we? Come, Mr. Frodo, let's go down the path
        at any rate!&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Very
        well, Sam. If you wish to go, I'll come,&quot; said
        Frodo; and they rose and went slowly down the winding
        road...</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">Frodo and
        Sam could go no further. Their last strength of mind and
        body was swiftly ebbing. They had reached a low ashen
        hill piles at the Mountain's foot; but from it there was
        no more escape. It was an island now, not long to endure,
        amid the torment of Orodruin. All about it the earth
        gapes, and from deep rifts and pits smoke and fumes
        leaped up. Behind them the Mountain was convulsed. Great
        rents opened in its side. Slow rivers of fire came down
        the long slopes towards them. Soon they would be
        engulfed. A rain of hot ash was falling.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">They stood
        now; and Sam still holding his master's hand caressed it.
        He sighed. &quot;What a tale we have been in, Mr. Frodo,
        haven't we?&quot; he said. &quot;I wish I could hear it
        told.&quot; ...</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">But even
        while he spoke so, to keep fear away until the very last,
        his eyes strayed north, north into the eye of the wind,
        to where the sky far off was clear, as the cold blast,
        rising to a gale, drove back the darkness and the ruin of
        the clouds.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">And so it
        was that Gwaihir saw them with his keen far-seeing eyes,
        as down the wild wind he came, and daring the great peril
        of the skies he circled in the air: two small dark
        figures, forlorn, hand in hand upon a little hill, while
        the world shook under them, and gasped, and rivers of
        fire drew near.</font></p>
