        </strong><em><strong>Michael Whelan's Works of Wonder</strong></em><strong>...</strong></font><p><font
        size="2" face="Arial">I was already fascinated with Larry
        Niven's free-fall environment, and then in this book I
        was especially taken with his descriptions of life in and
        around the &quot;Clump.&quot; The Clump is a LaGrange
        point wihtin the Smoke Ring where curious matter of all
        types has collected; in the deepest part of the interior
        it is flowing &quot;soup,&quot; an area the inhabitatns
        call the &quot;Dark.&quot; given the already strange
        ecology of the Smoke Ring proper, the addition of
        organisms peculiar to the Clump made for an intriguing
        proposition irresistible to an illustrator.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In this view, the Clump
        flows into our field of vision from the lower left
        corner. Spherical green puffball plants and
        &quot;jungles&quot; provide shelter for some inhabitants
        of the region, while (from the painter's angle) providing
        an essential reference to the Earthbound viewer for
        spatial distance and perspective. Strange life forms, the
        peculiar geometric &quot;huts&quot; of the human
        inhabitants of the region, ponds, clouds, and other
        strange objects flaot around the scene like shapes in a
        Miro painting. In fact, there is so much going on in
        there that I was concerned that the human activity on the
        right would clutter things up too much! Unlike the
        painting I did for the cover of <em>The Integral Trees</em>,
        this one encompasses both suns within its field of view
        though they are somewhat obscured by haze or Clump
        material.</font></p>
