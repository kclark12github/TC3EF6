        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">Chief
        menace to Pern is &quot;Thread,&quot; a corrosive and
        devastating life form which migrates from the Red Star
        (seen in the sky of each of the first three covers) to
        fall on Pern at regular intervals. Only the dragons, with
        their ability to literally burn the Thread out of the sky
        before it reaches the ground, can save the inhabitants of
        Pern. The excitement of the Thread-fighting episodes was
        an irresistible subject for my second painting in this
        series.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately,
        I seemed to have made a good. McCaffrey visualized the
        Thread as falling like straight strands of spaghetti,
        whereas my concept of it was of squirming ribbon-like
        things descending in clumps and tangles. It's much too
        late to correct it now, but I'm left with the problem of
        what to do if I ever paint another such scene in the
        future: should I use my own precedent or McCaffrey's text
        as a guide? </font></p>
