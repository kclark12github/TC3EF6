        <p align="center"><font size="3">An opportunity to paint
        C.J. Cherryh's catlike Hani is always welcome. I am
        fortunate to have done several covers for the books in
        this popular series, yet for <em>Chanur's Legacy</em> I
        came up with more new concepts than ever before. I think
        the reason is that the changes in the personalities of
        the characters are so engaging, and the other aliens in
        the series are great. I haven't had much of a chance to
        paint them yet, so I hope I get to do at least one more
        cover before the series draws to a close.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="3">In my initial concept
        for this image, the eyes of the second Hani glowed in the
        dark of the lead Hani's shadow. The publisher didn't like
        the effect because it seemed to draw attention away from
        the cat in front. I went along with her opinion, but I
        never felt comfortable with the decision: I made the
        change by painting the eyes on removable plastic tape, so
        I have the option of restoring the painting to its
        original state! I still haven't decided.</font></p>
