        <p align="center"><font size="3">My schedule gets booked
        up many months in advance, so Del Rey Books commissioned
        me to do this cover before the book was even written.
        They outlined the plot of the book (<em>All the Weyrs of
        Pern</em>) for me, and the author, Anne McCaffrey, gave
        me a scene she had written which she suggested I use as
        inspiration for the cover.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="3">Before I started work on
        the preliminary concepts, I had a dream about this scene.
        It resembled what you see here except that there were no
        trees. Anne liked the idea and gave her okay. But since I
        often second-guess myself, not believing that my first
        idea can possibly be the best, I did several alternate
        concepts. Though I had some other good ideas, I kept
        coming back to the one from my dream. </font></p>
