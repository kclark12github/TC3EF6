        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">As on my
        other Piers Anthony covers, the focus for <em>Green
        Mother</em> is the protagonist of the story. But this
        character appears only briefly in the story as a mother
        with green hair-- usually she is described as an
        attractive young adult. That is how I chose to depict
        her, though the former guise would probably have
        &quot;captured the title&quot; better.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">I did about
        five concept renderings for this commission. Four of them
        featured the lady dancing in various active and flowing
        poses. The remaining one was rather sedate in comparison:
        the woman seated, playing the harp, in a woodland scene.
        I included it with the others I sent to the art director
        never thinking that he might choose such a
        straightforward approach! But that is exactly what he
        did. I don't see why, even now. In any case, I am quite
        pleased with the results, so there are no complaints on
        my part.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">Most of my
        art now is infused with some symbolic or metaphoric
        elements, and this piece is no exception. Some examples
        include the flowers (for instance, the red lilies
        representing the Earth Goddess, regeneration, and
        immortality), the astronomical symbols for the Earth and
        Moon in the Woman's jewelry, and the little devil-headed
        snakes on the sound board of the harp, a reference to her
        dismayed discovery that she is destined to become Satan's
        bride. All these are merely supporting elements intended
        to make the union between the artist's and the writer's
        worlds more complete on the cover, our point of tangency.</font></p>
