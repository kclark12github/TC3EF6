        <p><font size="3">As I mentioned elsewhere, the greatest
        measure of my satisfaction as an illustrator is when I
        can produce an artwork that reflects my artistic concerns
        just as much as it illustrated the book. This painting is
        one of the best examples I have of this happy condition.
        It is a piece I would have done anyway, and it would
        stand on its own in a gallery without reference to any
        book; yet it also works well as a cover for the book,
        Tanith Lee's novel <i>Death's Master</i>.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><i>The Narrow Way</i> is one of the two
        paintings I have done outdoors. I felt I needed to paint
        the mottled tree shadows near real trees throwing their
        shadows on the ground around me.</font></p>
