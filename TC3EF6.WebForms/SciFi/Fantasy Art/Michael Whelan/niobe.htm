        size="2" face="Arial">Since 1975, I have worked almost
        exclusively in acrylics, but I still love to paint in
        oils. Not long before doing this cover, I moved to a new
        studio that was larger and better organized than my old
        one, and it provided me with a space for an easel and
        taboret just for oils. I could have each medium in its
        own area to save the time of switching my whole setup
        from one to the other. After a ten-year hiatus I did
        three oil paintings. &quot;Niobe&quot; is the second one.
        She is attended by her chief attributes, a spindle and
        scissors (with the symbolic Death's head in the pattern),
        and is seen measuring a glowing &quot;Thread of
        Life.&quot;</font></p>
