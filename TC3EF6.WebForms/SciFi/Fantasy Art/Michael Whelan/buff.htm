        <p><font size="3">Reading a novel by M. John Harrison
        always leaves me with the feeling that I've experienced
        some vivid, chaotic dream full of important but
        indecipherable symbols and images. This painting attempts
        to take the mood and give it a visual expression. The
        title is the name of the character wearing the mask.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">This is one of the few paintings I've
        traded for a piece of work by another artist. in this
        case the other artist was the fantasy sculptor Hap
        Henriksen. I feel safe in saying that we both believe we
        got the better of the deal... which is how such things
        should be.</font></p>
