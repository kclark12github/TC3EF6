        <p><font size="3">Sometimes a cover concept blazes into
        my vision while reading the book, and I know that <em>that</em>
        idea will do and no other. Unfortunately, even after
        finding the best approach, I will spend a couple of days
        trying to outdo it just to make sure that my first
        instinct was the correct one.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">So it went with the cover to <em>Catspaw</em>,
        by Joan D. Vinge. The title character possesses latent
        psi abilities that enable him to sense other people's
        thoughts... provided he takes a certain seductive and
        addicting drug. To heighten his powers he is compelled to
        get hooked on the drug. To heighten his powers he is
        compelled to get hooked on the drug, which he administers
        to himself via a skin patch placed behind his ear. Cat is
        always checking to see if the patch is there, and it
        occurred to me what an evocative gesture that was. It
        suggests his nervousness about coming down from the drug
        as well as the idea of him listening to other people's
        thoughts. he is poised between the hot, fast-paced world
        of the urban underground and the cool, rarefied
        atmosphere of the moneyed elite-- thus the even split in
        the composition between cool and warm hues.</font></p>
