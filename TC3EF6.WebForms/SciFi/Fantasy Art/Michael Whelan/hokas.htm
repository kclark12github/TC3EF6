        <p align="center"><font size="3">The &quot;Hoka&quot;
        books, by Gordon R. Dickson and Poul Anderson, have been
        favorites among SF fans for many years. The Hokas are an
        intelligent teddy bear-like race of extraterrestrials who
        possess an outrageous propensity for imitating the fads
        and icons of popular Earth culture. So in the pages of
        the Hokas stories, one can find a Hoka Sherlock, a Hoka
        Napoleon, a Hoka... well, you name it. The surreal
        juxtaposition of characters from wildly different times
        and sources is at the heart of these satires.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="3">I was invited to
        contribute the preliminary conceptualizations for a Hoka
        movie project, and with the popularity of both science
        fiction movies and teddy bears, it seemed a great idea. I
        enlisted David Wenzel to help with realizing some of the
        characters and scenes. not only did David offer
        invaluable advice regarding period details and
        atmosphere, but his preparatory drawings and watercolors
        for paintings such as these were right on the mark.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="3">Despite all the effort,
        and some eye-boggling work by Rick Baker (an Academy
        Award-winning makeup artist), the movie was never made.</font></p>
