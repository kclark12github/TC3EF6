        Whelan's Works of Wonder</strong></em><strong>...</strong></font><p><font
        size="2" face="Arial">My first challenge in doing a
        painting for this novel was to decide whether or not to
        attempt to fit the cover concept into the unifying scheme
        of my first four <i>Foundation </i>covers. The planet
        Trantor would not be an appropriate background for this
        cover-- though it appears on the previous covers-- since
        it is not a part of this story. Yet I felt some of the
        already developed symbolism worked well and could be
        applied to this painting, too. So what I ended up with
        was a &quot;yes-and-no&quot; answer to my problem: no
        backdrop featuring Trantor, but some symbolic links to
        the other covers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The most obvious of these
        links was to be the moon, which is very important to the
        story and also could be represented in the circular shape
        used in the previous covers to represent the galaxy and
        its destiny. All save one of the sketches I submitted to
        the art director used the moon in the sky as a background
        element. Of course, that single moonless sketch was the
        one that was chosen!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fortunately, the scene
        from the book that the painting illustrated involved a
        character wearing a spacesuit; the bubble helmet provided
        the circular element that I was looking to include in the
        rendering. The scene also describes the discovery of a
        long-lost civilization. What I added is the <i>model</i>
        of the statue: none other than the heroic robot Giskard.
        Daneel's friend and closest ally, Giskard is ultimately
        the primary reason for humanity's exodus into space--
        thus the field of stars around his head.</font></p>
