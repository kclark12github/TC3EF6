        <p><font size="3">There is ample evidence on the
        bookstands for the truth behind the saying &quot;Don't
        judge a book by its cover.&quot; The most important thing
        I seek as an illustrator is consistency between the art
        and the text.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">In doing the cover art commission for
        Melanie Rawn's <i>Sunrunner's Fire</i>, I had submitted a
        color sketch with everything in place, as in the final
        version, but by mistake the anatomical structure of the
        dragon's wings was inconsistent with the wings of the
        dragons on the previous three covers I'd done for the
        series. For the full-scale painting I corrected the wings
        to match the earlier ones.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">My client liked them better the first
        way.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">I tried to explain that it was
        important to maintain uniformity between the dragons and
        the text, but they wanted the wings like the ones in the
        concept and that was that! My response was to start over
        entirely and do a painting with the wings designed as in
        the color sketch. That way, I thought, if a fan remarked
        unfavorably about the differences I could point to the
        first version. I sent in the second version, and not one
        person has commented to me regarding the dragon's wings!</font></p>
