        </strong><em><strong>Michael Whelan's Works of Wonder</strong></em><strong>...</strong></font><p><font
        size="2" face="Arial">Being suspended in space, floating
        unencumbered yet in control of one's flight, is as close
        to experiencing pure freedom and tranquility as I can
        imagine. It seemed inevitable that I would enjoy reading
        this book and attempting to visualize an entirely
        credible alien environment based on that weightless
        feeling. It suggested an infinite number of pictorial
        possibilities.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As an artist, I am also
        intrigued by the physics of the lighting in Niven's
        &quot;Smoke Ring.&quot; For example, there is a sharp,
        cool light source orbiting a warm, diffuse light source.
        This would mean a constantly shifting color balance and
        intensity as well as a gradual change from one light
        source to two, in addition to eclipses with one star over
        another, or occasional eclipses by clumps of matter in
        the system, and so on. Given the complexity, I thought it
        best to portray the Smoke Ring Itself rather than to
        focus on one character in particular. Though the front
        cover features a female inhabitant, the painting as a
        whole is dominated by the central star.</font></p>
