        <p><font size="3">After reading Stephen King's <i>Firestarter</i>,
        there was only one image I could envision for the cover:
        the moment of supreme realization of the protagonist's
        power. I used my niece, Laina Madsen, for my model
        because she fit King's description of his character so
        well. I originally visualized her with an angry face, so
        I hung around the house and waited until Laina had an
        argument with someone. In all the pictures I took of her
        that day, she looks pretty grouchy! Anyway, in typical
        fashion, I changed my mind after consulting the text
        again. A look of trancelike fascination, as if she were
        enthralled by the experience of her power blossoming into
        fullness, would be more true to the novel.</font></p>
