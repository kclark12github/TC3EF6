        <p align="center"><font size="3">I'm used to being
        pigeonholed by my clients, who often hire me to paint
        only certain kinds of subjects. So I admit I was thrown
        when I started reading Paula Volsky's novel <em>Illusion</em>.
        I couldn't understand why bantam had given me the book.
        yet in almost no time I was enthralled. here was a big
        novel, rich and full of living detail, that demanded the
        best effort I could manage.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="3">The story has so many
        twists and turns that it was an exceptional challenge to
        find an image to capture the feeling of the whole. As in
        past efforts, symbolism came to my rescue. Essentially,
        the book is about the changes the main character goes
        through. With metamorphosis as the key concept, I painted
        the gates in the shape of a butterfly. Then came the
        concept of the heroine passing from one life to another,
        as represented by the gate separating darkness from
        light, and the rest fell into place. </font></p>
