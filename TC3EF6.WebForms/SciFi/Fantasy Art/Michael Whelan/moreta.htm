        size="2" face="Arial">For the six weeks prior to doing
        this cover, my hand had been in a cast. Although I had
        the cast molded with a brush in my hand so that I could
        still paint, my hand movements were greatly restricted. I
        did two paintings with the cast on, but both involved
        painstaking detail; with my restricted movements, the
        experiences were very tense. When the cast came off, my
        tremendous sense of freedom prompted me to use sweeping
        motions and bright colors. This scene was not my first
        choice, but I enjoyed painting the surging energy of the
        dragon's leap in a larger-than-usual format.</font></p>
