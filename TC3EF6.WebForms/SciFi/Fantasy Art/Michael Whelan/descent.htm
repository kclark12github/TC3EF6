        <p>This painting was commissioned for the cover of Ray
        Bradbury's <em>The Martian Chronicles</em>. What moved me
        the most about the novel was the sense of inevitable
        tragedy that permeates the first half of the book and the
        weirdness of the Martian culture.</p>
        <p>At some point in the narrative, the cities are said to
        be like bones; and though the phrase may have been
        inteded as metaphor, I liked the suggestion enough to use
        bonelike and corallike forms in the painting.</p>
        <p>The chief symbolic element is the trail of the
        descending craft from Earth, harkening back to legends of
        comets as harbingers of doom. It hangs like a scimitar of
        death over the heads of the Martians.</p>
