        face="Arial">Unlike most cover illustrations I've done,
        the artwork for the &quot;Incarnations of
        Immortality&quot; series is set within a box without any
        type running over it. This is both good and bad for me.
        It's great to be able to compose art without having to
        allow for the title and the author's name, but when the
        illustration is reproduced so much smaller than usual it
        demands a very simple composition. The latter is my main
        reason for taking a &quot;portraiture&quot; approach to
        these covers. In this case, I chose <i>Chronos</i> with
        his major attributes: his hourglass and cape.</font></p>
