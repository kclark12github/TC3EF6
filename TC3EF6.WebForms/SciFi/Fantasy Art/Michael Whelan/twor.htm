        <p><font size="3"><i>Two Worlds</i> is an oil painting
        done as a commission for DAW Books, for one of their <i>Year's
        Best Horror</i> collections. Nevertheless, it's a
        personal work, really... an allegory on Western
        disassociation and insulation from the suffering going on
        in the third world. It abounds in symbolism; the owl, for
        example, is a classical symbol of wisdom... in this case,
        though, he is blindfolded and carrying coins in his
        clutches. &quot;Now what do you suppose Michael means by
        that?&quot;</font></p>
