        size="2" face="Arial">The Lovecraft panels were done for
        Del Rey Books. They wanted 7 HPL novels but only had a
        budget for two paintings, so I offered to do two
        paintings worth of horror that they could then dissect as
        they saw fit for the book covers. When I started on the
        works it was a beautiful spring May morning (complete
        with happily chirping birds, etc.) ...so to get in the
        mood I blacked out all the windows of my studio and put
        on &quot;X&quot; by Klaus Schulze, cranked up my
        compressor, and jumped right into the painting. </font></p>
