        Whelan's Works of Wonder</strong></em><strong>...</strong></font><p><font
        size="2" face="Arial">Hari Seldon, the benevolent grand
        architect of the next millennium is seen here against the
        splendor of Trantor at the height of its power. It is a
        world completely sheathed in metal: one gigantic city
        which is the hub and nerve center of the Empire. Hari
        Seldon and Trantor inspire and permeate the whole series;
        they are the books' ultimate symbols, and so the only
        choice for the first cover. The composition is meant to
        suggest the stately grandeur of the monumental
        civilization. As in the Greek and Roman columns of
        antiquity, the towers represent the tradition, law, and
        bureaucracy of the thousand-year empire.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Seldon is poised in his
        wheelchair; the light is coming from low on the horizon--
        it could be dawn or sunset, or both-- signifying the
        impending doom of Trantor and the birth of the
        Foundation. On his lapel is a raven, representing the
        nickname given Seldon by the citizens of Trantor. He is
        bound to confinement, but he has the stars and planets in
        his lap as he looks with confidence to the future he so
        clearly sees.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was only later that I
        noticed another aspect of the symbolism in this painting.
        I have always had a horrible fascination for the A-bomb
        and I painted this during the fortieth anniversary of the
        bombing of Hiroshima-- that's the only explanation I can
        think of for my subconscious design of the peculiar
        shapes of the towers.</font></p>
