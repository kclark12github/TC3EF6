        size="2" face="Arial">When a book has a character as
        interesting and well delineated as Killashandra, the best
        cover approach is simply to render an accurate portrait
        of her. If the painting works, the force of the
        character's personality alone confronting the viewer
        should be sufficient to draw the attention of the casual
        observer to the book.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In this instance, I had
        just finished a painting of similar approach (<i>With a
        Tangled Skein</i>, a very direct front-and-center
        composition). To avoid the feeling of duplication, I
        turned Killashandra's attention away from the viewer and
        toward the impending storm threatening on the left. This
        change turned the illustration into a narrative one,
        added the symbolism of the storm, and heightened the
        tension and interest in the painting. The result is a
        whole lot better than my first sketches for this book.
        There is an interesting extended interlude in the story
        where Killashandra is marooned on a small island in a
        vast sea, and my earliest sketches illustrated that
        scene. After re-examining the pictures, I realized that
        such a cover would give the casual observer the
        impression that the book was a &quot;Ms. Robin
        Crusoe&quot; story, &quot;so out they went...</font></p>
