        Michael Whelan</u></h3>
        <p><font size="3">I was glad to learn that Joan D. Vinge
        was writing a sequel to <i>The Snow Queen</i>, and even
        more so when I got a call from Warner Books for the cover
        assignment. From the moment I finished the manuscript, I
        knew how the cover art had to look... a mirror of the
        first, with some obvious differences.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">As in the painting for <i>The Snow
        Queen</i>, the mask becomes the framing structure for
        symbols of various ideas and elements in the novel. The
        central figure is seen holding vials representing the
        &quot;water of life&quot; and the &quot;water of
        death.&quot; In the background is a spaceport in sunset,
        with the converging lines on the tarmac pointing to a new
        horizon. The middle of the sun disk in the center of the
        woman's mask is a slightly altered biohazard/mutagen
        symbol, and important reference to the plot.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Whatever the specific elements of the
        composition, I was very concerned that the color scheme
        have a dark, yet golden summery quality to it.</font></p>
