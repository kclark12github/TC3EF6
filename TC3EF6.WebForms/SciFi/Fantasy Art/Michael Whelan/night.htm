        <p><font size="3">If I don't take the time to keep notes
        during the creation of a painting, I often forget the
        meaning of some of the symbolism in it. The plants in
        this illustration for Tanith Lee's novel <i>&nbsp;Night's
        Daughter</i> have some sort of symbolic rationale for
        their presence in the painting, but I can't for the life
        of me remember what it is. It was important enough to me
        when I was doing the painting that I went out looking for
        a house in the area that I knew was landscaped with some
        of the flowers seen in the foreground of the image. I
        recall receiving curious looks from the occupant of the
        house as I stalked around making sketches and notes about
        the plants.</font></p>
