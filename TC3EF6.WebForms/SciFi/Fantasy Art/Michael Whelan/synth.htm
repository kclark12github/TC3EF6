        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After experiencing the
        look of the Plant men on the second cover of the series,
        I was hesitant to follow exactly Burroughs' description
        of the Synthetic Man. He is described as being all mixed
        up physically, and his brain actually belongs to someone
        else, so he is unavoidably cartoony, but he is also a
        great guy and the hero of the story! A real quandary for
        me, but I had a lot of fun with the actual execution of
        the work. </font></p>
