        <p align="center"><font size="3">The most unusual aspect
        of this commission is that it was largely painting while
        I was being videotaped for a local TV show. I was taking
        a big risk in allowing this to happen. I had come to
        think that I couldn't really create in anything other
        than the womblike studio in which I'd been working for
        the past several years. I presumed that the tangle of
        wires, the lights, and the presence of other people in my
        studio would distract me to no end, preventing me from
        completing any work of consequence.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="3">To my surprise, these
        things hardly affected me at all. I blocked out enough of
        what was around me to do my work without great
        difficulty. Probably the knowledge that it was strictly a
        temporary situation made it endurable.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="3">I knew from the start
        that the painting would appear on half the books as
        painted and on the other half &quot;flopped&quot;-- with
        the back side front, so to speak. This had a sort of
        playful appeal: Which books would sell more, the ones
        with the alien on the front or the ones with the human?
        In addition, I was intrigued with the idea of seeing the
        two different books in stores side by side on the
        bookshelves, the two forming a whole image of the cover
        art. </font></p>
