        <p><font size="3">Ever since I started using symbolism in
        paintings, I've naturally defined different types and
        uses of it. All symbolism serves the basic desire to
        convey thoughts and feelings that can't be expressed
        adequately (or as economically) in other ways.
        &quot;Literary&quot; symbolism is a way to communicate
        ideas found in a test I am illustrating. In my
        &quot;personal&quot; symbolism, I hint at unifying themes
        and idiosyncratic concepts that go beyond the fundamental
        subject base of the piece.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><em>Golden Dream</em>-- for the novel
        by Ardath Mayhar based on the original stories by H. Beam
        Piper-- contains narrative symbolism. once a
        technological, space-faring race, the Fuzzies of the
        novel have lost their high technology and reverted to
        hunting-and-gathering tribal culture. Thus, the brightly
        colored butterfly flying just out of reach of the younger
        Fuzzy is a symbol of the loss of precious knowledge
        through the succession of generations.</font></p>
