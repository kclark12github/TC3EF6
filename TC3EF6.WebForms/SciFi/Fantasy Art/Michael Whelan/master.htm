        the only John Carter cover in which I intentionally
        deviated from the story. In the actual scene, the Master
        Mind does not appear, but Lester del Rey thought the
        cover painting should go along with the title, so I took
        the liberty of placing the character in the scene. The
        composition reflects my concern for uniting the front and
        back sides of the cover painting. The arch of the wall
        and the tubes and equipment in the foreground form an
        oval that both focuses attention on the center of action,
        the operating table, and involves the white ape in the
        scene. </font></p>
