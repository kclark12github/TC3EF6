        Works of Wonder...</strong></font><p>This is the only
        cover painting I have done for Del Rey Books in which I
        was &quot;art-directed&quot; into doing something I did
        not want to do. On the odd occasion came that Don Munson,
        the del Reys, and I had a detailed discussion about a
        cover, I selling the away feeling that they had pulled
        out of me not only the best image for that I felt was
        important. This one went against my grain: it gave away
        book, but also an image that I was happy to do because it
        communicated something the mystery of what aliens looked
        like; there was no indication that the creature was an
        alien (it looked more like a mutant elephant
        characterizations of the aliens virtual portrait of them.
        In fact, the most on a rampage); although much was made
        in the e engaging enough to interest me in doing a story
        of the aliens being herdbeasts, this creature was alone.
        Nevertheless, the werenjoyable thing about doing this
        painting was detailing the texture of the alien's skin.</p>
        <p>Though I am satisfied with the resulting painting <em>as
        a book cover</em>, I plan to &quot;finish&quot; it when
        it's returned to me-- adding mushroom clouds, contrails,
        brilliant though tiny specks in the sky, and burning
        buildings in the far distance.</p>
