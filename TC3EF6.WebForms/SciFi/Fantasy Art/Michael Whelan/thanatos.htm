        size="2" face="Arial">Just before beginning this painting
        I broke my right hand-- my painting hand! --and I found
        myself forced to function with my fingers, wrist, and arm
        immobilized in a cast. Determined not to let the injury
        stop me from painting, I employed several tricks to
        circumvent my temporary infirmity.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">First, I took a paintbrush
        with me to the doctor's office so that the cast could be
        molded around my hand holding the brush. That way I could
        still paint large areas with that hand. Then I relearned
        how to paint with my left hand. Although I am not
        ambidextrous, I had done some left-handed artwork before
        and I managed. The most interesting trick though, was
        devised by my good friend John Crawford, who is a
        top-notch engineer. John masterminded a radio controlled,
        solenoid-operated airbrush for me, which allowed my left
        hand to work the airbrush strapped to the cast on my
        right arm! However there was one hitch-- the crystal in
        the transmitter was set on a frequency that allowed
        interference from local CB traffic... and at times my
        airbrush would mysteriously sputter into life and begin
        spraying on its own!</font></p>
