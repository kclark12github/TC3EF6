        <p><font size="3">Though the cover illustration by Leo
        and Diane Dillon on the first edition of <i>The Snow
        Queen</i>, by Joan D. Vinge, was excellent, Warner Books
        decided to commission me to do a new one. Perhaps the
        sequel was in the works, and they wanted a consistent
        style on the covers of the two volumes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">It's a terrific novel, but painting a
        cover for it was a real challenge. I knew there would be
        plenty of inspiration to be found within its pages, and
        in fact, my first response was that there was <i>too</i>
        much-- too much epic quality to capture in one
        illustration.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Eventually, it occurred to me that the
        mask, important in so many ways to the story, would be an
        ideal way to feature several of the themes and characters
        of the book within a design context that wasn't a
        montage. It was a solution that satisfied me-- I loath
        the montage as a book cover approach.</font></p>
