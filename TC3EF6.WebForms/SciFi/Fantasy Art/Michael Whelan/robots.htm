        the best solution to a problem. As a reflection of my
        great enjoyment of this book, my early concept drawings
        were complex arrangements of thematic symbols-- my
        attempts to portray most of the interesting facets of the
        novel. However, none of these sketches seemed quite
        right, and as I worked, I found the concepts evolving
        gradually into more basic compositions. I decided that
        the pivotal plot element was the robot Giskard, and the
        most interesting metaphors were of dawn/dusk and trees.
        So I posed Giskard against a Solarian landscape.
        Giskard's pose echoes the tree shapes, as he shields his
        eyes from the light and gazes skyward to the stars where
        the destiny of man-- and robot-- ultimately awaits.</font></p>
