        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">Although
        this is the third book in the series, this was my first
        Pern cover, and I was determined to create the dragons as
        faithfully to Anne McCaffrey's description as possible. I
        studied crocodiles and bat wings, and wrote to Anne with
        many questions. After all that, it was somewhat of a
        let-down to have Judy-Lynn Del Rey tell me that based on
        their descriptions, it would be physically impossible for
        the dragons to fly. It's because they &quot;think&quot;
        they can that they do.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial">This
        painting represents a major benchmark in my career as an
        artist. It was my first painting to appear on a hard
        cover (and a best-selling on, at that) and seemed to
        bring me a small measure of national recognition. It has
        been a successful print, and the original has been
        popular in shows all over the country. I guess I couldn't
        miss with red-white-and-blue as a color scheme!</font></p>
