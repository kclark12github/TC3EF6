        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The main problem in doing
        what are called &quot;wraparound&quot; covers-- cover
        paintings that wrap around from the front to the back of
        the book-- is in trying to avoid pieces that look like
        two different paintings stuck together. Sometimes I work
        hard at wedding the two halves, and other times I like
        the demarcation between the two sides and I seek to
        exploit it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The two sides of this
        painting flow together. But it obviously contains two
        main objects of interest vying for attention... there is
        just enough extra interest on the right to cause the eye
        to settle on that side, which is fine for western eyes,
        used to reading from left to right.</font></p>
