        <p><font size="3">Some paintings are fondly remembered
        because the simple act of creation was so enjoyable. This
        cover art for Tanith Lee's novel <i>Red As Blood</i> is
        one of these paintings.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">I regret selling the painting. There
        are collectors out there who I strongly suspect are
        psychic. They always manage to call me with offers to buy
        art on days when I am feeling down on my work, and I
        foolishly let some piece or another go because I'm tired
        of looking at it. Then I find I miss it. If I hadn't
        started using an answering machine, I might not still own
        any of my work.</font></p>
