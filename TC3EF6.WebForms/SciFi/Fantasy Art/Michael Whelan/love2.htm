        Whelan's Works of Wonder</i></b><b>...</b></font><p><font
        size="2" face="Arial">During a visit to the Del Rey
        offices, Judy-Lynn, Lester, and Don Munson posed this
        problem: &quot;We have seven re-issues of H.P. Lovecraft
        books to publish and a budget for only two covers. What
        can you do?&quot; I love to do Horror and have done many
        covers for that genre for other publishers, but I hadn't
        yet had the chance to do one for Ballantine/Del Rey, so I
        was delighted to take up the challenge. Seen here in
        their original form are the two paintings I came up with.
        They meet side by side either way with one flowing into
        the other, and portions of them were used to make the
        cover art for the seven books.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Technically speaking,
        these paintings were executed with virtually no
        preparatory work. For my larger pieces, I usually do at
        least one value and one color study, but I launched into
        the Lovecraft panels armed only with my airbrush and my
        feelings for the &quot;horrific.&quot; Using the airbrush
        as a sketching tool, I started with black on a gray
        ground. Gradually several conceptual areas began to
        develop. After achieving some definition in the light and
        dark areas, I introduced a very light gray color and
        refined the images further.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a while, I put away
        the airbrush and continued to sharpen the focus with
        conventional brushwork until the panels were completed.
        Wanting to do a single, long image but not having the
        space in my studio to do so, I split the imagery into two
        panels. They function together as a long piece anyway:
        the edge of one panel blends into the other either way
        you put them</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">An unplanned obstacle to
        the execution of this painting was the weather: it was
        beautiful outside! Only by blacking out my studio windows
        and playing a nonstop selection of abysmally depressing
        music was I able to maintain the nightmarish mood
        necessary for the completion of these works.</font></p>
