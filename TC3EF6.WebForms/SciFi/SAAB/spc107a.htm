	<H2>THE ENEMY</H2>

	<font size=4>
	<b>MISSION:</b> Cargo Drop (supplies) on Planet Tartarus
	<p>

	<b>SUMMARY:</b>
	Vanessa Damphousse is under a preliminary inquiry by Ross for the "failure to
	obey an order" and "misbehavior before the enemy." She recalls this episode as
	she looks at the blood on her hand.
	<p>

	The 58th is on its way to drop supplies on Planet Tartarus which has experienced
	the worst casualties since the beginning of the war; not from aliens, but from
	friendly fire. As they land, a private without a helmet is killed from behind
	by a Marine. The Marine stalks the 58th citing the following camp cadence, and
	is eventually killed by a laser mine (buzz beam);
	<p>

	<blockquote>
	"Born in the woods, trained by a bear,<br>
	double set of dog teeth, triple coat of hair,<br>
	'M-mean as hell,' 'A-all the time,' 'R-rough and tough,'<br>
	'I-In the mud,' 'N-never quit,' 'E-every day!'"
	</blockquote>
	<p>

	As they retreat to the ISSCV, the 58th is hit with strobing lights which causes
	burns on their skin. Wang, in trying to kill a cockroach, ruins the radio.
	Damphousse, after seeing blood on her hand, feels covered in it and tears her
	uniform trying to get away from it. Hawkes, affected by his feeling of
	claustrophobia, can't stand to wear his helmet and tries to pull it off while
	outside. West could swear he hears a woman screaming. Vansen, afraid of the
	dark, insists on using her flashlight exposing the squadron's whereabouts.
	<p>

	To fix the radio, all but Damphousse exit to locate a cluster of 'uplink proms'
	from the dead Marine's field pack. After the proms are collected, they enter a
	bunker filled with eight Marines who apparently killed one another. After
	evaluating the bunker massacre and their own experiences, the 58th discovers
	that the strobe lights release an electronic nerve gas which intensifies a
	person's greatest fears.
	<p>

	Upon their return, Damphousse, unable to enter the radio room because of her
	intensified fear of blood, instructs Vansen on how to fix the radio. They
	succeed in making contact with McQueen and are evacuated from the planet.
	<p>

	In closing, McQueen tells Damphousse that the Inquiry Panel has acquitted her of
	all charges and voted against further investigation.
