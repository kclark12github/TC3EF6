PREFACE

    i.  What is this document?

      This document is the Space: Above and Beyond Frequently and 
        not-so-Frequently Asked Questions list.  
        It is a completely unofficial document, compiled by David French 
        (phoenix@paranoia.com), and attempts to pose and answer some of
        the more commonly asked questions about the hit Fox show 
        Space: Above and Beyond. 

    ii.  I've read the FansFAQ, but I still have questions.  Who can I ask?

      While I've made an effort to be as complete as possible in this document, I
        obviously can't know everything.  Luckily for everyone, there are some 
        excellent sources of information out there.  For starters, try Fox themselves,
        at their Web site 
        (http://www.foxworld.com/spcindx.htm)
        Another excellent source of information is the space-l, maintained by 
        Pat Moss.
        For instructions on how to join space-l, check Section III, Part A of this 
        document.  Also, the SAAB Encyclopedia 
        (located at http://www.microserve.net/space:aab/encyclopedia/), which is also
        maintained by Pat Moss, is a very excellent compilation of a lot of information,
        much of which was used to compile this document.  If you still have questions,
        I think it's safe to say that only Morgan and Wong can help you...  
        Keep watching!

    iii.  There is a HUGE blunder in the FansFAQ!  How can I correct it?

      Alas, humanity is frail in its capacity to err, and I am no exception.  If you spot
        something that is blatantly (or even slightly) incorrect, just contact me at
        my mail address (phoenix@paranoia.com), and I will make every effort to 
        ascertain whether your keen observation is correct.  If so, the FansFAQ will be 
        amended, appropriate credit will be given.

    iv.  The FansFAQ is great!  To whom can I send money? 

      Ahh, the generosity of the masses.  Alas, I cannot accept any money for this 
        document; it is simply a labor of love, and to accept remuneration would violate
        my principles (not to mention certain legal issues).  Therefore, please only
        send your comments, questions, emotional tirades, and/or divine inspirations,
        and send them to phoenix@paranoia.com.

I. General Information about Space: Above and Beyond

    A.  TV information

      1.  What is Space: Above and Beyond all about?

        Space: Above and Beyond (SAAB) is a futuristic show about a group of 
          United States Space Marines (the 58th Squadron, "Wildcards"), on the 
          front lines of a galactic war with a mysterious enemy.

      2.  When does Space: Above and Beyond air?

        SAAB normally airs on the Fox Network, at 7 P.M EST, Sundays.  
          Each episode is an hour in length.
  
      3.  Why is Space: Above and Beyond always being pre-empted?

        Good question.  I have no idea why Fox continues to bump SAAB in favor 
          of sports, or worse yet, moronic movies.  Perhaps one day they will get the 
          hint that we fans get a little upset when our favorite show is continually 
          pushed back.

      4.  Is Space: Above and Beyond a spin-off of the X-Files?

        The only connections between SAAB and the X-Files are that they are 
          both Fox shows, and they have both been co-produced by Messrs.  
          Morgan and Wong.  Thus, it can be expected that both shows are excellent, 
          and this proves to be true.  I'm sorry to say that there probably won't be any 
          anomalous space-time continuum lapses which mysteriously transport two FBI 
          agents onto the deck of the Saratoga, or which suddenly create an inter-
          dimensional wormhole which traps five Hammerheads in a secret government
          installation outside of Washington, D.C.  But then again, I might be wrong...  
          We'll just have to keep watching to find out.

    B.  Show information

      5.  What is the background for Space: Above and Beyond?
    
        [from the Fox Network's World Wide Web site]
        Space: Above and Beyond is set in the year 2063.
          After years of universal peace, the people of Earth have begun colonizing other 
          planets.  Suddenly, a previously unknown alien race annihilates two fledgling
          communities. Earth's top fighter squadrons are decimated and our group of 
          military cadets is unexpectedly hurled onto the front lines of an intergalactic 
          war. 

      6.  What are the Wildcards?

        The Wildcards are the United States Marine Corps Space Aviator Cavalry,
          58th Squadron.  They are a group of young Space Marines, fresh out of the
          academy, who have been assigned to the front lines of the war against the
          enemy (known only as 'Chigs').  Their current assignment is aboard the 
          SCVN U.S.S. Saratoga.

      7.  What is the Saratoga?

        The U.S.S. Saratoga is an SCVN (Space Carrier Vehicle (Nuclear)), registry
          number SCVN-2812, currently under the command of Commodore Ross.  It is
          the base of operations for multiple squadrons, including the 58th.

      8.  What are the Chigs?

        The Chigs received their name because they allegedly look like Earth chiggers
          (which are small, six-legged larvae of mites).  The Chigs are an alien race,
          who, according to reports, decimated the two Earth colonies Vesta and Tellus,
          thus beginning the galactic war in which the 58th currently find themselves
          fighting.  Chigs appear humanoid, though they are rarely (if ever) seen sans
          their armored environment suits.  Contact with human-breathable atmospheres
          apparently causes Chigs to dissolve, as does exposure to regular water.   Chigs
          have also apparently allied themselves with the A.I.'s; however the true nature
          of this alliance is yet unknown, and is possibly one of mutual necessity.

      9.  What are AI's/Silicates?

        [from the Fox Network's World Wide Web site]
        The Artificial Intelligences (AI's, or Silicates) are human-looking, walking
          personal computers built to be servants and soldiers for the human race.
          Designed to be visually pleasing, the A.I.'s are beautiful physical specimens.
          However, their eyes are eerie white with rifle sight-like crosshairs in place 
          of pupils. These computers are programmed to comprehend abstract concepts
          such as philosophy and ethics, but they were restricted from creating and 
          acting on original ideas. 

      10. What were the A.I. wars?

        [from the Fox Network's World Wide Web site]
        When a disgruntled programmer inserted a virus program into the A.I. 
          mainframe system which gave the A.I.'s a risk-taking perspective on life, 
          they revolted against their human masters and the A.I. wars began. 
          "Take a Chance" became the new A.I. motto and the Earth became a deadly
          battleground.  The War moved into space after numerous years of terrorism on
          the ground. Following their "Take a Chance" philosophy, an aggressive group of 
          A.I.'s commandeered a military spacecraft and launched themselves into space,
          expanding the boundaries of their bloody battle against the "Carbonites" -- 
          their technical name for humans. 

      11. What are InVitros?

        [from the Fox Network's World Wide Web site]
        Since human casualties were dangerously high, the inhabitants of Earth created 
          a race of people conceived by in vitro fertilization and bred for war. This new 
          race of humans were conceived in artificial gestation chambers or tanks 
          (from which the derogatory term "tank" derives). They remain suspended in 
          cryogenic sleep until age 18, at which time they are awakened and sent into 
          battle.  Unfortunately, since In Vitros were born from parents who never
          lived and never benefited from a loving family life, they turned out
          to be very poor soldiers -- having neither a love of family nor a
          feeling of patriotism for their country. Out of guilt and dissatisfaction, the 
          In Vitro platoons were eventually dissolved by the government and the "tanks" 
          soon evolved into a rebellious race of political untouchables. The "navel" 
          present at the back of their necks (where the artificial umbilical cord was 
          attached in the gestation chamber) became the only visible distinguishing 
          feature, making them easily recognizable and an easy target of constant
          discrimination. 

      12. What is AeroTech?

        [from the Space: Above and Beyond Encyclopedia]
        Not much is known about AeroTech.  We know that they are a government 
          organization responsible for the only two human colonies on other worlds, 
          the ill-fated Vesta and Tellus colonies. It is run by a Board of Directors, 
          among which is a man named Sewell, who is becoming somewhat of a thorn
          in Commodore Ross' side.  Diane Hayden, the current Secretary General, was 
          also a member. The Board is apparently under the jurisdiction of the Senate.
          It is possible that AeroTech has had dealings with both the Chigs and the A.I.'s
          (which has lead to wild speculations on the part of the fans, particularly
          those on space-l.  See Part I, Chapter E more info)

    C.  Character information
  
      13. Who are the major characters?

        [from the Fox Network's WWW site and from the SAAB Encyclopedia]
        [for more information, consult the Space: Above and Beyond Encyclopedia]
 
         a.  Nathan West
          Nathan West, First Lieutenant, Serial Number <classified>
          5th Wing, 58th Squadron, US Marines, Callsign "King of Hearts"
          West was originally slated to be a member of the Tellus colonization program,
          along with the woman he loved, Kylen Celina.  Nathan was bumped at the last
          minute, due to a political decision which required a certain percentage of the
          colonists to be InVitros.  Nathan attempted to stow away on the ship to Tellus,
          but was discovered and was forced to join the Marine Corps.  He harbours a
          fear that he will never find Kylen.  He now serves as a member of the 58th 
          Squadron, under Lt. Colonel McQueen, aboard the Saratoga.

         b.  Shane Vansen
          Shane Vansen, First Lieutenant, Serial Number 560-51-03318
          5th Wing, 58th Squadron, US Marines, Callsign "Queen of Diamonds"
          Vansen was scarred during childhood by witnessing the death of her parents at
          the hands of A.I. terrorists, and has harboured a hatred and fear of A.I.'s since.
          Shane harbours an intense fear of the dark, which possibly stems from this
          experience.  She cared for and raised her two sisters, and finally joined the 
          Marines, both to honor her parents, and to escape the responsibility for their lives. 
          Ironically, Vansen naturally surfaced as the leader (honcho) of the 58th, and now 
          serves in that capacity in the 58th squadron, under Lt. Colonel McQueen, 
          aboard the Saratoga.

         c.  Cooper Hawkes
          Cooper Hawkes, First Lieutenant, Serial Number 948-98-01446
          InVitro Batch: 2040 Alpha 3439, Gene Pool16A, Philadelphia facility
          5th Wing, 58th Squadron, US Marines, Callsign "Jack of Spades"
          Hawkes, an InVitro, was 'born' just after the InVitro platoons were disbanded,
          and escaped from the InVitro Education Centers onto the streets.  He was
          arrested for smashing a police car, and sentenced to join the military, where
          he was a troublemaker until his friendship with Mike Pagodin ("Pags").  After
          Pags was killed on a training mission to Mars, Hawkes swore revenge on those
          that had killed him, the Chigs.  Cooper harbours a fear of closed spaces (aka
          claustrophobia.  Duh.)  He now serves as a member of the 58th Squadron,
          under Lt. Colonel McQueen, aboard the Saratoga.

         d.  Paul Wang
          Paul Wang, First Lieutenant, Serial Number 948-30-34828
          5th Wing, 58th Squadron, US Marines, Callsign "Joker"
          Wang joined the military out of curiosity, and is seemingly shy and insecure.
          He has a great sense of humor, and uses it to handle some of the more intense
          situations in which he finds himself and his comrades.  He is a huge football fan,
          and roots for his hometown Chicago teams.  He harbours an intense fear/hatred
          of cockroaches, which was spawned by his childhood exposure to them.  He
          now serves as a member of the 58th Squadron, under Lt. Colonel McQueen, 
          aboard the Saratoga.

         e.  Vanessa Damphousse
          Vanessa Damphousse, First Lieutentant, Serial Number 943-20-02419
          5th Wing, 58th Squadron, US Marines, Callsign "Ace of Hearts"
          Damphousse (or 'Phousse, as her comrades call her) joined the  Marines to find
          direction in her life.  She has a relationship back home with a previously-married
          man, whose daughter has trouble accepting her.  She has a background in
          nuclear physics, having studied at Cal-Tech and interned at the San Onofre
          Nuclear Power plant.  Vanessa harbours a sickening fear of blood.  She now 
          serves as a member of the 58th Squadron, under Lt. Colonel McQueen, aboard
          the Saratoga.

         f.  T.C. McQueen
          Tyrus Cassius McQueen, Lieutenant Colonel, Serial Number <classified>
          InVitro Batch: 2025 Kappa 9757, Gene Pool 13C, Anchorage facility
          Commanding Officer, 58th Squadron, US Marines, Callsign "Queen Six"
          Early on, McQueen served as a miner on Omicron Draconis to release him from
          indentured status.  McQueen was a member of the InVitro platoons, but stayed
          on after they were officially disbanded.  He eventually came to be the CO of
          the 127th Squadron ("Angry Angels"), which was decimated one of the first few
          battles of the war with the Chigs.  This battle left McQueen without a squadron,
          and with 20% of his body burned, he was grounded.  He then took command of
          the 58th, and presently serves in that capacity aboard the Saratoga.

         g.  Commodore Ross
          Ross, Commodore, Serial Number <classified>
          Commander, USS Saratoga, US Space Navy, Callsign "Old Man"
          Ross serves as the Commander of the SCVN U.S.S. Saratoga.  Not much is
          known about his previous career, but he seems to be familiar with McQueen
          (whom he affecionately refers to as "Ty")  Since the start of the war with the
          Chigs, he has become well-versed in Chig tactics and is an effective Commander.
          He has a fondness for his guitar and for his rum, the combination of which has 
          undoubtedly led to his affinity for the blues.
 
      14.  Who are the minor characters?

         a.  Howard Sewell
          Sewell is a member of the Board of Directors of AeroTech.  He is a somewhat
          shady character, always appearing whenever something interesting happens
          aboard the Saratoga.  He may be privy to information regarding the Chigs that
          the WildCards are not, and has been involved in at least one of the 58th's
          missions (to the Chig world and subsequently Kazbek).  More information on 
          Director Sewell is unavailable at this time.

         b.  Feliciti
          Feliciti is an A.I., and a recurring nightmare for the 58th.  The first Feliciti 
          encountered was model Feliciti OH-519, who led a band of A.I.'s on a raid of
          the Icarus Mining colony.  Model Feliciti OH-483 was encountered aboard the
          Saratoga in a meeting of delegates to elect a new Secretary General.  Whatever
          the model number, Feliciti remains a constant threat to the WildCards.

         c.  Diane Hayden
          Diane Hayden is the newly elected Secretary General of the United Nations.
          She came to power after the previous S.G. was assassinated by an InVitro.
          The means by which she were elected are clean enough, though the
          circumstances preceeding that election are not.  She might have been involved
          in an assassination attempt against Nicholas Chaput, who was her competitor
          for the S.G. seat.  It has also been speculated that at the time she was a 
          member of AeroTech, AeroTech knew of the Chigs' existence and went ahead 
          with colonization plans anyway.  She remains a potent unknown to the
          WildCards, especially Nathan West, who confronted her about AeroTech 
          and the Chigs.

         d.  Sergeant Major Bougus
          Master Sergeant Bougus was the 58th's Drill Instructor in Boot Camp.  He 
          was a hard-case, and demanded the very best of them while they were training.
          In an unforgettable training exercise, where Hawkes' behavior caused 
          everyone's death in a simulator, Bougus taught them a lesson about teamwork 
          and asses.  He sent them on their first training mission to Mars and the 58th 
          never looked back.

         e.  Lt. Stroud
          A Naval officer who serves aboard the Saratoga.  She had a romantic 
          encounter with Paul Wang before his ill-fated mission aboard a captured Chig 
          Bomber.  Since his torture by A.I.'s during that mission, Wang has not been the 
          same, and little is known about the current relationship between Stroud and Wang.

         f.  Kylen Celina
          Kylen is Nathan West's girlfriend, lost to him since her ill-fated mission as a
          Tellus colonist.  Kylen still haunts Nathan, his only reminder of her a locket which
          plays the message "I believe in you."  Nathan has grown fixated on this locket as
          a symbol of Kylen.  He gave it to Wang at a Christmas party after a mission, who
          presented it as a gift from the 58th to McQueen.  Kylen was possibly sighted on
          Kazbek, but the presence and subsequent destruction of an alien clone of Kylen
          shrouds her actual whereabouts in mystery.

         g.  Ray Butts
          Raymond T. Butts, Lieutenant Colonel, Serial Number <classified>
          US Marines Force Reconnaisance, 
            temporarily assigned 58th Squadron, Callsign "Deuce"
          Lt. Colonel Ray Butts was assigned to a secret mission prior to forcefully docking
          aboard the Saratoga.  He recruited the WildCards on an equally secret mission,
          which turned out to be a recovery of the Hammerheads flown by his team, all of 
          which had been killed.  Butts sacrificed himself in a black hole to buy the 58th a
          chance to escape from Chig Fighters.  
          Butts' favorite thing to say was "Easy as eating pancakes", and the 58th so 
          honored him by releasing a pancake feast into space.

         h.  Matthew Burke
          Matthew Burke, Lieutenant Colonel, Serial Number <classified>
          Burke was assigned to a desk job investigating paranomal occurrences (including
          so-called 'anomalous intuition'), so when he heard about Damphousse's
          experiences with anomalous intuition, he proceeded post-haste to the Saratoga.
          He attempted to help Vanessa unlock her abilities, but was seemingly unsuccessful.
          Burke died while observing Damphousse on a mission to destroy a Chig 
          encampment.

         i.  Kelly Winslow
          Kelly Ann Winslow, First Lieutenant, Serial Number <classified>
          5th Wing, 58th Squadron, US Marines, Callsign <classified>
          Winslow, a relatively new member of the 58th, joined on shortly after the S.G.
          of the U.N. was assasinated.  She is blunt, sarcastic, with a good sense of humor.
          One hopes that she won't be assigned red-shirt status by TPTB.

      15.  Who are the historical characters?

         a.  Dr. Stranahan
          Dr. Stranahan was an employee of the corporation which manufactured A.I.'s.
          Unsatisfied for one reason or another, Stranahan took it upon himself to insert
          a virus into the A.I.'s mainframe system with the simple phrase "Take a chance."
          This seemingly harmless act triggered the A.I. wars, and bought Stranahan a
          one-way ticket to infamy.

    D.  Episode information

      16.  What are the episodes all about?

      17.  What are the next episodes going to be about?
         [This section is currently incomplete.  More information is forthcoming.]

    E.  Plot information

      18.  How are AeroTech and the AI's connected?

        The relationship betwen AeroTech and the A.I.'s is unknown.  A group of A.I.'s
        were invited by Diane Hayden to the summit to elect a new S.G., so there may
        be some connection there.  Also, the A.I.'s were present on Kazbek, and Director
        Sewell seems to have played a part in that entire mission.  The truth is that much
        speculation and few facts have been presented, so this relationship is still murky.

      19.  How are AeroTech and the Chigs connected?

        It is not known what relationship AeroTech has with the Chigs.  Certainly, AeroTech
        possesses much knowledge about the Chigs, from their thorough examination of
        Chig corpses and technology.  It has been suggested that AeroTech knew of the
        existence of the Chigs BEFORE sending out the Vesta and Tellus colonization
        efforts (Diane Hayden was a member of AeroTech when these missions were 
        launched, so it is possible she was in on this information).


      20.  How are the Chigs and the AI's connected?

        The Chigs and the A.I.'s seem to be cautious allies, as related by the A.I.'s
        on Kazbek, a mining facility which the A.I.'s operate for the Chigs.  It is probable
        that the A.I.'s have given information on Carbonites (humans) to the Chigs, but in
        exchange for what remains a mystery.

    F.  Technical information

21.  What kind of ships do the Earth forces have?
        [from the Fox SAAB Web site]
        [from the SAAB Encyclopedia]

        a.  SA-43 (Hammerhead)
          [from Kevin Goddard]

          The SA-43 Endo/Exo-Atmospheric Attack Jet ("Hammerheads") is the main-stay 
          of the Marine Corps. Their SCRAM engines enable them to fly in an atmosphere and 
          in the almost complete vacuum of space.  Following in the modular design of aircraft 
          of the late 20th century, Hammerheads can be adapted for normal combat, search and 
          rescue, and possibly other missions. The canopies of the craft are also detachable 
          allowing docking with space platforms. Systems that are known to exist in the 
          Hammerheads include LIDAR (Laser Infrared Detection And Ranging), HUD
          (Heads-Up Display) and ODP (Optical Disk Playback).
 
        b.  ISSAPC

          The Inter Solar System Armored Personnel Carrier is designed to interface with the
          ISSCV, and provides the means of transportation for military operations.  It has been
          nicknamed "Flying Winnebago", due to its resemblance to that vehicle.

        c.  ISSCV

          The Inter Solar System Cargo Vessel is a large, rectangular modular containment
          vessel capable of carrying human and mechanical cargo alike.  The ISSCV is
          transported by the ISSAPC, and can serve as a base of operations.

        d.  SCVN

          SCVN stands for Space Carrier Vehicle (Nuclear), and is the space equivalent of
          the aircraft carriers of today's Navy.  SCVN's are armed with powerful cannons
          and missile launchers, as well as a complement of SA-43 Hammerheads.  The 
          fighter launch bays are on the bottom of the ship, and there are landing pads on
          deck for ISSAPC docking.

      22.  What kind of weaponry do the Earth forces use?
        [from the SAAB Encyclopedia]

        a.  K-Bar
          [from El Sparko Diablo]

          The K-Bar is the standard issue Marine Corps fighting knife.  While the 20th
          century version was not intended to double as a bayonet, the 21st century version
          obviously is.

        b.  M-590

          The M-590 Assault Rifle is the standard issue Marine Corps firearm.  It is a
          projectile weapon, fired by squeezing the handguard.  It can be mounted with a 
          scanner.

        c.  Smart Grenades
          [from the Fox SAAB WWW site]

          Smart grenades are "launched" by tossing them into the air.  Their tiny gyros and
          fins propel these high-tech devices through the air using their "intelligence" to
          seek out the target.  If a target manages to temporarily conceal itself, these devices
          are able to halt and hover in mid-air, waiting for the right moment to strike.

      23.  What kind of ships do the Chigs have?
        [from the SAAB Encyclopedia]

        a.  Fighters

          The standard Chig fighter is faster than an SA-43, while being less maneuverable.
          It has three "wings", and comes in at least two versions, the standard black/purple
          fighter, and a red version, which has the ability to pass through the gravitational
          wash of a black hole.

        b.  Bombers

          The Chig bomber is, to date, the only enemy craft of which we have even partial
          knowledge.  It is controlled by bio-electric feedback, and is partially organic.
          The bomber is cone-shaped, almost like a dart.  It has a range similar to Earth forces'
          capital ships.  A captured Chig bomber provided us with almost all the knowledge
          we possess about them.

        c.  Destroyers

          The U-378 Class-D Chig Destroyer is equipped with rockets, lasers, and mines.  It
          possesses special microwave equipment that interferes with communications and
          reactors, causing their core temperatures to spike.  The U-378 favors the "soft kill",
          destroying the enemy indirectly rather than through direct assault.

        d.  Motherships

          The Chig mothership, briefly seen during the Battle of the Belt, is the largest Chig
          craft yet seen.  Virtually nothing is known about these dual-wedge shaped craft.

      24.  What kind of weaponry do the Chigs use?

        a.  Hand-to-hand

          Chigs appear to favor a wickedly-curved blade, which they use to hack helpless
          Marines apart with.  It doesn't appear to be too effective in actual hand-to-hand
          combat, as seen during "Who Monitors The Birds", as Hawkes defeated all Chigs
          he encountered.  Then again, maybe Hawkes was far superior to any of their forces.

        b.  Rifles

          The Chigs carry a rifle, which appears to be an energy weapon.  It is rather large
          and bulky, and uses a plasma accelerator to deliver its shot.  Not much else is known
          about this weapon. 

        c.  Buzz-Beams

          Buzz beams are a nasty variation of a land-mine.  It is activated by stepping on it.
          When the victim releases their foot, laser beams actively slice through the body from
          below, making a buzzing noise, which may be the origin of its name.  It has been
          theorized that buzz-beams are connected with the Chig fear weapons.

        d.  Fear weapons

          The Chigs have apparently invented some sort of weapon which acts on the portion
          of the brain which stores fear memories.  It accelerates activity in this area, causing
          a dull ache.  The victim's worst fears are enhanced, and can often be debilitating.
          However, the effects are temporary, waning until the next exposure.  Each
          exposure lowers the victim's resistance to the weapon, and it is unknown whether
          resistance can be built up.

       c.  Cooper Hawkes (Rodney Rowland)
          The son of a preacher, Rodney Rowland was born and raised in Newport Beach,
          California, and is the self-described "black sheep" of the family, due to his rebellious
          youth.  He began a career modeling in Europe in his late teens, and has been featured
          in high-profile campaigns for J. Crew and Calvin Klein.
          Rowland was encouraged by noted photographer Bruce Weber to pursue his dream
          of acting.  He moved from modeling to acting classes and work in low-budget films
          and New York theater.  He has starred in New York stage productions of "Fuel", 
          "Who's Got the Edge", "Hazards Ahead", "Waltzing in Wonder", and "Short Fuse".

         d.  Paul Wang (Joel de la Fuente)
          Born in New Hartford, New York (yea!) and raised in Chicago, Joel de la Fuente
          began his career behind the scenes as a stage manager in high school, but once on
          the board to better understand his duties, he enjoyed the limelight, and continued to
          perform in plays.  At Brown University, he left the acting path and obtained a 
          Bachelor of Arts degree, but went back to the field with New York University's
          graduate acting program.
          He has performed at New York's Shakespeare Festival in "The Two Gentlemen of
          Verona", and "All's Well That Ends Well", as well as in the NYU productions of
          "Holy Ghosts", "Yankee Dawg, You Die", "The Castle", and the title role of

         e.  Vanessa Damphousse (Lanei Chapman)
          Perhaps best known for her role as Ensign Rager on "Star Trek: The Next
          Generation", Lanei Chapman, a Los Angeles native, had an interest in acting from
          the time she was young.  Her father enrolled her in a drama school, which also
          provided her with speech therapy to overcome a lisp, and she appeared in several
          major commercials as a child.
          She attended Dartmouth College, earning a degree in Spanish along with taking as
          many drama courses as her electives allowed.  While still in college, she wrote her
          first play, "Home Run", which she later produced and directed starring Fields.  It
          won third place at the Los Angeles Cultural Center's Annual Short Play Contest.
          After graduation, Chapman tried her hand at teaching before joining the Black
          Actors' Network to pursue acting full time.  She is currently attending the USC
          graduate film school, devoting all of her free time to developing and filming her
          thesis project.
          Filmography:
            Pretty Hattie's Baby
            "The Wonder Years"

         f.  T.C. McQueen (James Morrison)
          Born in Alaska, James Morrison began his career as a clown and wire-walker
          for the Carson and Barnes Wild Animal Circus before deciding to focus on theater,
          film, and television projects.
          On stage, Morrison performed in "El Salvador", for which he won Dramalogue and
          Los Angeles Drama Critics Awards, "Down the Road", which also earned him a
          Dramalogue Award, and the London production of "Still Life", which garnered him
          a Fringe First Award as Best Actor.  Among his numerous theater credits are roles in
          "Richard II" and "Julius Caesar" at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego, and "Cat on
          a Hot Tin Roof" at the Mark Taper in Los Angeles.
          Morrison pursues writing in his spare time and his plays have been read and
          produced at The Sundance Institute, The Playwright's Center, Los Angeles Theatre
          Works, and the MET Theater.  He recently wrote and directed his first film,
          "Parking", produced by his companion and business partner, actress Riad Galayini,
          which will soon be shown at film festivals.

    B.  Crew information

      27.  Who are the producers of Space: Above and Beyond?

        [from the SAAB FAQ v1.0]
        The show was created by James Wong and Glen Morgan, best known for
          their work on the Fox television show _The X Files_.  Wong and Morgan have
          known each other since high school in San Diego, and have been writing 
          partners since their days at Loyola Marymount University.
          After an "apprenticeship" at Sandy Howard Productions and writing their
          first feature "The Boys Next Door", they became writers on the short-lived
          series _Knight Watch_, thus beginning their television writing careers.  Following
          _Knight Watch_'s demise, they went to work for Stephen J. Cannell, working for
          Fox Broadcasting's first "hit" series _21 Jump Street_, and it's spinoff _Booker_.
          Their additional television credits include co-creators and executive producers of
          the short-lived NBC series _The 100 Lives of Black Jack Savage_, and as
          supervising producers on _Wiseguy_ and _The Commish_.  They moved back to
          Fox to be co-executive producers of _The X Files_.

      28.  Who is on the production team?

        [from the SAAB FAQ v1.0]
        Stephen Zito is the co-executive producer.  He has previously worked on:
          _McKenna_, _The Escape Artist_, and _MacGyver_.
        Tom Towler is the supervising producer.
        Howard Grigsby is producer.
        Tim McHugh is the visual effects producer, and a member of Area 51.  He has
          helped set up Amblin Entertainment's special effects department, and served
          as SFX director for the _SeaQuest DSV_ pilot.
        Glenn Campbell is the visual effect supervisor, and a member of Area 51.
        Bernard Hides is the production designer, and has worked on Brian de Palma's
          _Casualties of War_.
        Tony Palmieri is the director of photography.

      29.  Who are the writers for the show?

        [from the SAAB FAQ v1.0]
        The writers for SAAB include:
          Matt Kiene and Joe Reinkemeyer, who were staff writers for _L.A. Law_ and
          story editors for _Law and Order_.
          Marilyn Osborn, who contributed to _The X Files_.
          Tom Towler is also a writer for the show.

      30.  Who produces the music/sound for the show?
        Shirley Walker is the music director, whose previous credits include Batman: The
          Animated Series.
        Dave West Sound in L.A. is responsible for the sound effects mixing.

      31.  Who produces the special effects for the show?
        The special effects are done by a company called Area 51, who handles all the 
          computer generated scenes (which, frankly, are spectacular).

        Hardware/Software:
        [from Area 51]

        We use DEC alpha PC's, running at 275 mhz, along with Pentium 133's. Our
          primary rendering engine is Newtek's Lightwave, which we use to generate most
          of our images. We also use Photoshop to produce our custom texture maps,
          Elastic Reality, WinImages fx, and Fractal Painter. We preview our animations
          on a Perception board, and lay the final animation off to Exabyte tape for
          transfer to DCT tape for final editing. Most of our compositing is handled by
          Lightwave, but we find it faster and easier to comp our bluescreen cockpit
          shots at Varitel Video.

    C.  Statistical information

      32.  How much does each episode cost to make?
        I have been quoted from a reliable source that each episode costs roughly
          1.5 to 2 million US dollars to produce (that's the budget, anyway).

      33.  No, seriously, how much does each episode cost to make?
        Ok, ok,  I was just kidding.  Each episode actually only costs $17.64, give or take
          $2,000,000.00

      34.  Are there plans for a second season of Space: Above and Beyond?
        According to Rodney Rowland (Hawkes), there will be another season.  However,
          I haven't heard anything to this effect from anywhere else, so I'm going to assume 
          that Mr. Rowland is correct and that there will be another jam-packed season of our
          favorite Space Marines.  Hoo Raaah!!!

      35.  How is Space: Above and Beyond doing in the Nielsen ratings?
        Um... Actually, I have no idea.  I promise to look it up, though.  Really.
          Anyway, it must be doing pretty darn good, because Fox picked it up for another
          season, which is great news for everyone.  Semper Fi!

III. Space: Above and Beyond meets the Internet

    A.  space-l

      36.  What is the space-l?
          The space-l is the mailing list for Space: Above and Beyond.  According to its
          charter, the space-l deals with " discussion of the television show SPACE: 
          Above and Beyond.  It is also to be used for the discussion of Science Fiction 
          dealing with Militaristic Regimes".

      37.  Who runs the space-l?
          The space-l is graciously maintained by Pat 'wu' Moss.  To contact Pat concerning
          the space-l, send mail to PMOSS@ADMIN.MICROSERVE.NET.

      38.  How do I join space-l?
          To join space-l, check out the easy-to-use subscription form located at
          http://www.microserve.net/space:aab/subscribe.html.  You can use this form
          for all your space-l settings as well.

      39.  Is it true that the cast and crew of Space: Above and Beyond 
             are on space-l?
          Yes and no.  While some members of the cast and crew monitor space-l, they
          are not part of the same list that the general public use, for obvious reasons.
          Mostly they lurk (and, I hope, laugh) while the rest of us discuss their show.
          They use a separate list, maintained by Pat Moss for just this reason.  Don't
          worry, everything you say about them gets back to them in one manner or
          another.

      40.  What is the "List of Preverts", and how do I join?
          Imagine, a list whose membership depends on your state of mind!  Then, twist
          that thought with whatever your sick little mind can come up with.  At last,
          you understand the nature of the List of Preverts.  The List was sparked by some
          of the more insinuating (and innuendo-dripping) posts of some members of
          space-l (whose identities will be withheld to protect the innocent), and to join,
          one simply had to let loose from their mind a single post that might be construed
          to be 'perverted' (whatever that means these days).  It is all in fun, and one should
          not worry about members of this list stalking regular folk (unless, of course,
          you worry about that sort of thing anyway, in which case Carry On!)

      41.  What is Diablo Labs?
          Diablo Labs, brainchild and effigy of the notorious El Sparko Diablo, was created
          to bring forth SAAB-related items to the general public.  They have been involved
          in numerous projects, the most public of which was a massive campaign for
          the (Un)Official Space: Above and Beyond Holiday Gift Catalog.  Since then, Diablo
          Labs has been under constant attack for their (reportedly) inhumane treatment
          of Chigs.  This effort has been spearheaded by a group known as GreenChig.

      42.  What is GreenChig?
          GreenChig is an organization formed to preserve the humane treatment of Chigs
          in industry as well as private ownership.  Much as GreenPeace is dedicated to the
          environment, so GreenChig is dedicated to the well-being of Chigs everywhere.
          GreenChig was allegedly behind a scandal involving the kidnapping and subsequent
          release of the CEO of Diablo Labs, El Sparko Diablo.  However, none of these
          charges were ever formally resolved, as AeroTech conspirators covered up the entire
          incident.

      43.  I get sweaty just thinking about James Morrison.  Where can I
             go to rave about him?
          Fortunately, there exists a forum for discussing James Morrison, jmdg-l.
          Unfortunately, this list was not created to be a drool-fest, so as far as I
          know, no forum currently exists for the purpose of fawning over James Morrison.
          Yes, we all appreciate his acting.  No, we don't all appreciate the lust of various
          persons over him, especially in public forums.  I suggest Haagen-Dazs.

      44.  What does "YKYBWTMSAABW" mean?
          This stands for 
          "You Know You've Been Watching Too Much Space: Above and Beyond When.."
          It is a list composed of various situations that people have reportedly experienced
          which indicated to them that they have had severe overload of SAAB.  These
          incidents may be actual or fictional, but are almost all hilarious.  The list is
          maintained as Christine Chase's SAAB Humor site (See Part III, Section B)

      45.  What does "Can you imagine McQueen as.." mean?
          Yet another list maintained at Christine Chase's SAAB Humor Site, and more
          recently, at Kevin Goddard's SAAB site, this list originated from the episode
          Hostile Visit, in which Wang did a killer impersonation of McQueen as a 
          plumber.  Since then, SAAB fans have tried their own hands at describing
          occupations which McQueen might have had, had he not joined the Marines.

      46.  What is SWS?
          This stands for Space Withdrawal Syndrome, a crippling disorder which has
          been extensively documented by Mark Gray, at the SWS Analysis site (found
          at http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~raistlin/saab/saab_sws.htm)

    B.  The World Wide Web

      47.  What is the World Wide Web?
          Sorry, Charlie.  If you have to ask this question, stop reading this document
          immediately, and take your ignorant butt down to the nearest community
          college, where they will indoctrinate you into the wonders of the WWW.
          Then, I will be more than happy to discuss anything from the socio-economic
          impact of the Web to where I go for naked pics of Chigs.

      48.  What are the Space: Above and Beyond Web sites?

         a.  Fox Network's Space: Above and Beyond site
          The WWW posed the question "How cool can you get?"
          This site is Fox's answer to the WWW, and can be found at:
          http://www.foxworld.com/spcindx.html

         b.  Stanley B.'s SAAB Multimedia site
          This was the very first WWW site devoted to SAAB, and is simply awesome.
          It is the sister site to the Mission Status site, the multimedia half of the 
          Companion Sites.  It is maintained by Stanley B.,  and can be found at
          http://rampages.onramp.net/~brummett/space.htm

         c.  Pat Moss' Mission Status site
          A veritable cornucopia of links, gathered into one HTML document.
          This is the sister site to the Multimedia site, the information half of the
          Companion Sites.  It is maintained by Pat 'wu' Moss, and can be found at
          http://www.microserve.net/space:aab/

         d.  Pat Moss' SAAB Encyclopedia site
          This is a vast wealth of information about SAAB, neatly compiled in one easy
          reading document.  It is maintained by Pat 'wu' Moss, and can be found at
          http://www.microserve.net/space:aab/encyclopedia/

         e.  Christine Chase's Set of Official SAAB Lists
          This site houses a hilarious array of some of the wackier topics which have come up 
          on space-l, such as YKYBWTMSAAB and Can You Imagine McQueen As...
          It is maintained by Christine Chase, and can be found at
          http://www.orst.edu/~richardc/lists.html

         f.  El Sparko Diablo's (Un)Official SAAB Holiday Gift Catalog
          Only from Diablo Labs, the master catalog of all SAAB holiday gift ideas, such as
          the infamous Feliciti Fun-Pack and Plush 'n' Cuddly Wildcards.  It is maintained by
          El Sparko Diablo, and can be found at
          http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/2930/

      49.  Are there other Space: Above and Beyond Web sites?
        Of course!  There are, in fact, many many sites to choose from.  However, given the
          limited amount of space available, only the older sites are listed.  From the above
          sites, you should be able to track down just about every other site currently available.

      50.  Can I make my own Space: Above and Beyond Web site?
        Absolutely not.  You are hereby prohibited from ever making a site that has anything
          to do with Space: Above and Beyond.  Well.... OK, I guess in your case I'll make
          an exception.  But just this once!
          (for the humor-impaired, there are no monitors on who makes a site, so HTML
          to your heart's content)

    C.  Usenet

      51.  Are there any newsgroups dealing with Space: Above and Beyond?
        The only site that I am aware of is alt.tv.space-a-n-b, which gets mirror posts from 
          space-l (as far as I know).  Probably a great forum in its own right, it just never
          piqued my interest.

      52.  What are the NetRatings for Space: Above and Beyond?
        These are a list of fan-ratings for the episodes of Space: Above and Beyond.  They are
          compiled by Jeff Standish.  There is a voting form available at the Mission Status
          site.

    D.  Cast/crew contact
      53.  How do I get in touch with so-and-so?
        There are two schools of thought here.  One says that an email address is a public
          thing, and if it exists, it should be made publicly available.  Another school says
          that if someone wanted you to have their email address, they would give it to
          you.  I firmly believe in the latter.  However, with fan mail, it's not like the cast
          is soliciting mail, so it's not likely that they'll give out their email addresses en
          masse.  Luckily for everyone, Pat Moss has come to the rescue again, and set
          up a fan mail server on the Mission Status site, which is forwarded to the cast.
          If they really want to talk to you personally, they will mail you.  Trust me.

      54.  Is it OK to mail the cast/crew at their email addresses?
        Again, there are two schools, outlined as above.  If you feel like mailing the cast
          or crew, I'm not going to spank your hand.  However, don't be surprised if 
          they don't respond in a timely fashion (as they are all busy making new episodes!);
          in the case that you choose to flame them, I have no idea what would happen, but I 
          wouldn't recommend it.

      55.  I mailed so-and-so three weeks ago and I haven't heard anything!
             Why doesn't this person mail me back?
        As previously mentioned, the cast/crew are very busy cranking out new and
          exciting episodes.  It doesn't surprise me if I don't get a reply for a week or
          so (frankly, I'm happy I get a reply!)  So just be patient...

      56.  Where can I find out more specific information about so-and-so?
        Fortunately, there exist many informational sources.  You could try the SAAB
          Encyclopedia, Fox's site, The Internet Move Database (a favorite of mine,
          found at http://www.msstate.edu/Movies/), or space-l even.

      57.  I heard so-and-so was going to be on a Prodigy/AOL chat!!  How can
             I take part in this, and/or get a transcript?
        Aha!  The infamous AOL chats are only available to AOL subscribers, and we of
          space-l are not allowed access to the chat logs.  My only advice is to join AOL
          if you MUST take part in these chats.  I have no idea what Prodigy's policy is,
          except to say that I've seen 'bootleg' copies of chat transcripts, so I'd assume it's
          a little more lenient.

IV.  Miscellaneous Space: Above and Beyond

    A.  Space: Above and Beyond potpourri

      58.  Why do the 58th double as both pilots and ground forces?

        Actually, we're not too sure.  One might argue that in the future, technology
          is advanced to a level such that soldiers can be easily and readily trained in a
          multitude of positions, from pilots to grunts to technicians.  Some of the more
          hard-core military types (and a great many SAAB fans) insist that this is ludicrous,
          that any military worth its salt would not invest (perhaps) millions into a pilot
          only to use that pilot as a ground-pounder.  As for myself, well, a wise person
          once said that "people are willing to accept [many concepts from Star Trek], yet
          they religiously deny that standards in the military will change."  Go figure...

      59.  What does Semper Fi mean?

        Semper Fidelis (Semper Fi!) is a Latin phrase, meaning "Always Faithful".  It
          is the motto of the United States Marine Corps.

      60.  What are the Marines yelling all the time?  Hurrah?

        Another Marine facet, this is the battle cry of the United States Marines.  It has
          been described by official sources that the cry is "HOO RAAH!"  It has also 
          been described by official sources that the cry is "HOO YAAH!".  I leave it
          to the reader to decide which to yell.

      61.  What are the words to that cool Marine Corps 'Mickey Mouse Club' song?
     
        The song, which was heard on Tartarus, is as follows:

          "Born in the woods, trained by a bear;
            Double set of dog-teeth, triple coat of hair.
            M - Mean as hell
            A - All the time
            R - Rough and tough
            I - In the mud
            N - Never quit
            E - Every day
            S - Semper Fi! "

      62.  Are there any books dealing with Space: Above and Beyond?
      
        Yes.  There is a novelization of the pilot episode written by Peter Telep.
          The ISBN number is 0-06-105650-2, and retails for $5.50.  The book 
          contains additional information about the show that was in the script but
          never filmed.

      63.  What is that little book that McQueen reads from?

        The book is the Te-Tao Ching (Way of Life), written by Lao-Tzu, a Chinese
          philosopher.
