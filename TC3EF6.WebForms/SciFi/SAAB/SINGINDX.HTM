<FONT SIZE=4>When you're living in the 90s, living in New York and living single, you need all 
the help you can get -- like the companionship and support of good friends. Created by Yvette Lee 
Bowser (producer of <I>A Different World</I>&nbsp; and <I>Hangin' with Mr. Cooper</I>&nbsp;), Living Single 
is a fresh, funny and very real look at six young, upwardly mobile friends sharing the ups and 
downs of their lives, loves and careers.<P>

Khadijah James (Queen Latifah) is the smart, sophisticated and enterprising founder of Flavor 
Magazine; Synclaire James (Kim Coles) is her spirited, though sometimes naive, cousin; and Regine 
Hunter (Kim Fields Freeman) is a chic, social climber whose name fits, because she's usually hunting 
men.  The three share a New York apartment, but they rarely have it to themselves.<P>

Khadijah's best friend is Maxine "Max" Shaw (Erika Alexander), a brash and quick-witted public defender, who is always dropping by.<P>

And when four fly ladies get together, it's not long before the guys upstairs drop by: Kyle Barker 
(T.C. Carson), a slick, career-minded Wall Street executive and self-proclaimed ladies' man, has an 
ongoing love/hate relationship with the sassy Max; and Overton Jones (John Henton), the building's wise 
and witty handyman, is Synclaire's steady boyfriend.<P>

Together, these six share the fun, feuds and frustrations of young adulthood as only true friends can.</FONT><P>
