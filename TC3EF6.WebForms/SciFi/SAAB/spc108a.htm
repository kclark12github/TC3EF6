	<b>HISTORICAL REFERENCE:</b> J. Wilkes Booth; April 12,1865
	<p>

	"Tell mother I died for my country, I did what I thought was best."
	<p>

	<b>NEW CHARACTERS:</b> Cwirko, Lt. Charlie Stone, Lt. Susan Posarick, Lt. Dan
	Cook, Nicholas Chaput, Thompson (Chaput's personal asst.), Diane Hayden,
	Feliciti 0H483.
	<p>

	<b>MISSION:</b> "Cargo" pick-up (i.e. Diane Hayden) at the Armstrong Moon Base.
	<p>

	<b>SUMMARY:</b> The 58th Squadron's one week leave is canceled after the UN
	Secretary General Spencer Chartwell is assassinated by an In Vitro at New Delhi
	Stadium. Nicholas Chaput, acting world leader until the election, is in
	competition with Diane Hayden, US Ambassador, for the Secretary General
	position. Chaput comes aboard the Saratoga and demands, in view of the recent
	events, that Cooper and McQueen undergo a loyalty test.
	<p>

	On board the Saratoga, two more assassination plots are revealed; Nathan is
	requested by Chaput to evade his patrol during a secret meeting wi Hayden, and
	Cooper -- who has been 'brainwashed' by the injection -- is compelled to shoot
	at Chaput's swastika-like medal worn on his chest. Additionally, Shane
	encounters Silicates brought aboard as guests of Hayden's; namely, Feliciti
	0H483 (Shane killed the previous model #597 on Bunuel after discovering she
	killed her parents.)
	<p>

	Cwirko, involved in the conspiracy w/ Hayden and Thompson, tries to shoot
	Chaput. He escapes Nathan by boarding a hammerhead; but, due to a malfunction,
	he is killed when his plane blows up in space. McQueen, released from prison
	after agreeing to complete the loyalty test, becomes aware of the plot against
	Chaput and prevents Cooper from being an accessory. Thompson is arrested for
	setting up Chaput, but Hayden escapes punishment. Eventually, she is elected
	Secretary General.
	<p>

	Nathan later discovers that Chaput was correct when he said the Board of
	Governors (Diane specifically) knew of the alien existence <i>before</i> the
	Tellus mission.
