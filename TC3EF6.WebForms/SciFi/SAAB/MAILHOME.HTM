          life of Mary(Christine Taylor), a vibrant and
          enchanting girl whose passion and exuberance affects
          everyone around her.  She's "That Girl" for the
          nineties: a go-getter who's not afraid to use her
          feminine charm to get what she wants, and who never
          takes no for an answer.  Among her eclectic mix of
          cohorts there is Derrick(John Cameron Mitchell), an
          assistant fashion stylist with a quick wit and O'Neal,
          a former boxer with a heart of gold who turns to Mary

          and Karyn Parsons (FRESH PRINCE OF BEL-AIR)!

          This off-beat comedy for the ‘90s centers around the
          friendship of  Georgette "George" Sanders (Lori Petty),
          a struggling yet carefree artist, and her life-long pal
          Margot Hines (Karyn Parsons), a slightly neurotic
          dreamer in search of self and independence.

          Steering them into new and unchartered territories,
          George opens up her funky Venice apartment to Margot,
          who has just left her cheating wealthy husband once and
          for all.  Intent on searching out fun and romance, the
          duo begin to enjoy all of the finer things life has to
          offer.

          The odd group of characters in the series include
          sharp-witted and wryly humorous Hal Gardner(Sullivan
          Walker), the gruff proprietor of George's favorite
          hangout -- one of the neighborhood's seediest spots. 
          Hal's flamboyant bartender Nelson Marquez (John Ortiz),
          George's gorgeous neighbor across the hall , Lance
          Battista(Khalil Kain), Hamilton Ford Foster(Fab
          Filippo), the energetic 21-year-old upstairs neighbor
          and George's biggest fan; and Margot's meddling mother
          Ann Hines-Davis-Wilson-Jefferson-Ali(Concetta Tomei),
          who firmly believes that George has been and remains a
          bad influence on her daughter.

*****************************
SATURDAY NIGHT PREMIERES
*****************************

On SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1996, FOX will premiere our announced
SATURDAY  NIGHT FALL LINE-UP:
     o    From 8:00 -8:30pm(ET/PT), FOX premieres the ninth
          season of our hit cinema-verite series, COPS! As
          always, there will be a second COPS episode to fillout
          the hour.

     o    From 9:00-9:30pm(ET/PT), FOX premieres the eleventh
          season of the  longest running entertainment series on
          television today, MARRIED WITH CHILDREN!

          LOVE AND MARRIAGE(formerly announced as COME FLY WITH
          ME) as a companion series to MARRIED WITH CHILDREN!

          "Someday it won't be beer.  Someday it'll be Cristal." 
          That's the motto of April and Jack Nardini, the couple
          that literally puts the "work" into "working class."  
          April (Patricia Healy) works nights in a trendy New
          York restaurant; what she loses in sleep she
          compensates with creative homemaking (foil-wrapped
          leftovers from the restaurant double as the kids'
          school lunches).  Jack (Tony Denison) works days
          managing a parking garage.  They don't let their
          schedules distract them from each other, though:  they
          have a standing appointment every day --on the fire
          escape outside their living room window.  

          Former high school sweethearts who, 17 years and three
          kids later, still adore each other, Jack and April
          struggle with the demands of raising their family on a
          tight budget in a big city.  Christopher (Adam
          Zolotin), 11, would like to think he is wary and tough. 
          He would also like to think that his parents won't find
          out when he cuts classes.  Gemmy (Alicia Bergman) is 16
          and in full rebellion, complete with hair colors du
          jour and a pierced nose, lip and eyebrow --so far. 
          Michael, the oldest, is 17, and in his first year of
          junior college.  He holds down as many part-time jobs
          as he can physically handle in hopes of achieving his
          one goal:  to make enough money to move out.
               o    From 11:00p - 12:00a(ET/PT), FOX premieres the second
          season of our latenight hit series, MAD TV!

5.   Was DR. WHO and GENERATION X one-time-only movies or will they
     become series?<P>

<FONT COLOR="0000FF">
 At this time, there is no talk of a series or more movies for
     either title.<p>

     DR. WHO and GENERATION X were originally ordered as
     one-time-only made-for-TV movies.<p>

     We have the rights to one more repeat for each of the existing
     movies over the next several years.  We usually like to give
     our movie titles an 8 month to year minimum rest.  So look for
     them again sometime this winter at the earliest.  Stay tuned.<p>

6.	I want to write to my favorite FOX show/star, ask for an autograph or

7.	Can I get tapes of FOX shows sent to me?
<P>

<FONT COLOR="0000FF">
No.  We do not provide nor sell videos of any of our FOX shows, specials or
movies.  Our recommendation is to ask co-workers, friends, family and neighbors
for anyone who may have taped off-the-air the show you are looking for.  Also,
you might want to go to your favorite FOX SHOW chat line or message board and
ask friends there.
</FONT>

8.	Can I use content from the FOXWORLD Website in my site?
<P>

<FONT COLOR="0000FF">

If you use the ASK FOX comment form with a question about FOX and you receive an
E-mail answer, you may post the response elsewhere if you like.

9.	Can I buy merchandise from my favorite FOX show?
<P>

<FONT COLOR="0000FF">
At this time, we do not provide a FOX Store for viewers to purchase merchandise
of their favorite FOX shows.  Hopefully soon.
<P>

In the meantime, try Entertainment Weekly's Studio Store at 1-800-EWEEKLY.  We
can't guarantee they have merchandise on your favorite FOX show, but it is a good
place to start.
</FONT>
<P>

10.	How can I get tickets to a taping of my favorite FOX show?
<P>

<FONT COLOR="0000FF">
Just an FYI: Dramas are closed sets and do not allow audiences to view while
filming.  Sitcoms have and want audiences.  When you have locked down your plans
to visit the Los Angeles area, call Audiences Unlimited at 1-818-506-0043 for
tickets to your favorite sitcoms that are taping at that particular time.

11.	Are there any full-time jobs or internship positions available at FOX?
<P>

<FONT COLOR="0000FF">
<I>Write to:<BR>
FOX Broadcasting Co.<BR>
Personnel Dept.<BR>
P.O. Box 900<BR>
Beverly Hills, CA  90213
<P>

Job Hotline:  1-310-369-5755</I>
</FONT>
<P>

12.	Why can't there be an original episode of my favorite FOX show every week?
<P>

<FONT COLOR="0000FF">
Many of our shows, especially dramas, take 7-10 working days to shoot an
episode, plus approx. 30 days for post-production (including special effects) per
episode. The shows can only physically produce so many episodes a year, so we
need to give our shows a breather now & then.
<P>

In addition, a season usually runs from early September through the end of May
(36-40 weeks).  FOX, though, does order more episodes per season than the other
networks (i.e. <A HREF="melpindx.htm" TARGET="_top">MELROSE
PLACE</A> has an order for 34 episodes this season, <A
HREF="bh9indx.htm" TARGET="_top">90210</A> - 32 eps, <A
HREF="singindx.htm" TARGET="_top">LIVING SINGLE</A> - 27 eps, etc.
-- most other networks air an average of 22 episodes per show each season).
