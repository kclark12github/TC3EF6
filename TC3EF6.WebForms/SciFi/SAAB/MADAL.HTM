			Coming from a show business family (his dad installed TV antennas in
			Union, NJ), it was only natural that Artie became an actor.  After
			dropping out of college to study acting with Sandy Dennis and, after
			dropping out of acting school to earn money as a longshoreman, Artie
			made his way to New York, where he performed stand-up and helped found
			the sketch comedy group <I>Live on Tape</I>.<P>
			
			Artie's been seen in Spike Lee's <I>Jungle Fever</I>&nbsp; as well as the
			feature <I>Too Pure</I>.<P>
			
			You've seen him in the stands; you've seen him on TV.  Now years of
			intense rooting have taken their toll on the world's most die-hard
			sports fan, as portrayed by Artie Lange.  But can anything prepare him
			for the doctor's diagnosis?<P></TD>
