	<B>A 'DARK' BRANCH OF THE MILITARY TRIES TO RECRUIT DAMPHOUSSE INTO A
	SPECIAL SQUAD</B>
	<p>
	In a story based on a phenomenon reported in memoirs from soldiers in the Vietnam War,
	Damphousse begins having premonitions in the heat of battle and saves the 58th Squadron from
	destruction.  But a "dark" branch of the military wants to recruit her into a special squad to
	capitalize on her psychic abilities for covert operations.
