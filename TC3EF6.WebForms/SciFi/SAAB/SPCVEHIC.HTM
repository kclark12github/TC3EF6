<tr>
	<td>Hammerheads</td>
	<td>The SA-43 Endo/Exo Atmospheric Attack Jets are the top-of-the-line fighter
	jets of the Marine Corps.  Nicknamed for their resemblence to a hammerhead
	shark, these fighter jets have detachable canopies which lower onto and attach
	to their jets as required.  These canopies are raised and lowered from the
	FLIGHT DECK of the SCVN Saratoga.  Systems aboard the Hammerheads include LIDAR
	(Light Detection and Ranging), HUD (Heads Up Display) and ODP (Optical Disc
	Playback).  Hammerheads are capable of flight in both space and atmosphere and
	are powered by powerful SCRAM (Supersonic Combustion RAMjets).<br></td>

	<td>ISSAPC Retro Rocket</td>
	<td>A rocket that steers a ISSAPC.  An anology would be like a rudder on a
	sailboat, but there's no current or wind in space.  There are six rockets on
	the ISSAPC which steer and propel the ship, and allow it to land and take
	off.<br></td>

<tr>
	<td>ISSCV</td>
	<td>Inter Solar System Cargo Vessel.  It's a large, rectangular modular
	containment vessel capable of carrying human and mechanical cargo alike.  The
	ISSCV is transported by a winged carry-all, the Internal Stellar Armored
	Personnel Carrier (ISAPC).  The ISSCV serves as a base of operations on both
	Mars (in the <a
