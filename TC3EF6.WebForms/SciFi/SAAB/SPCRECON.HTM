<H2>IT IS THE 21ST CENTURY...</H2>
<font size=4>
...when the people of Earth are finally at peace with one another; for the first
time in the brief history of humankind, we are truly of one planet.  After 150
years of exploration, the silence of the universe has created a feeling of
solitude; that we are indeed alone in the universe.  To offset the inevitable
population explosion, adventurous citizens have begun colonizing other planets.
When an unprovoked alien force annihilates the fledgling communities and massacres
the colonists, the people of Earth enter a war in which they are seriously
outgunned and undermanned.
<p>

Thrust onto the front lines of the war is a squadron in the U.S. Marine Corps
Space Aviator Cavalry who are fresh out of basic training.  It is as a part of
this intense battle that the fighter pilots learn about faith in each other as
they strive to make a better world.  Instilled with the grim knowledge that they
must work together as a team in order to survive, they are constantly faced with
the reality of war that, at any moment, they could be killed, and the inhabitants
of Earth wiped out forever.
<p>

But the current conflict with the aliens is only a small part of the story.
Both the Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) Wars and the creation of the race of In
Vitros to fight the A.I.'s were key events that have also shaped this century.

<H2>THE A.I.'S</H2>

A.I.'s are extremely human-looking, walking personal computers built to be
servants and soldiers for the human race.  Designed to be visually pleasing, the
A.I.'s are beautiful physical specimens.  However their eyes are eerie white with
rifle sight-like crosshairs in place of pupils.  These computers are programmed to
comprehend abstract concepts such as philosophy and ethics, but they were
restricted from creating and acting on original ideas.  When a disgruntled
programmer inserted a virus program into the A.I. mainframe system which gave the
A.I.'s a risk-taking perspective on life, they revolted against their human
masters and the A.I. wars began.  "Take a Chance" became the new A.I. motto and
the Earth became a deadly battleground.
<p>

The War moved into space after numerous years of terrorism on the ground.
Following their "Take a Chance" philosophy, an aggressive group of A.I.'s
commandeered a military spacecraft and launched themselves into space, expanding
the boundaries of their bloody battle against the "Carbonites" -- their technical
name for humans.
<p>

<H2>THE IN VITROS</H2>

Since human casualties were dangerously high, the inhabitants of Earth created a
race of people conceived by in vitro fertilization and bred for war.  This new
race of humans were conceived in artificial gestation chambers or tanks (from
which the derogatory term "tank" derives).  They remain suspended in cryogenic
sleep until age 18, at which time they are awakened and sent into battle.
<p>

Unfortunately, since In Vitros were born from parents who never lived and never
benefited from a loving family life, they turned out to be very poor soldiers --
having neither a love of family nor a feeling of patriotism for their country.
Out of guilt and dissatisfaction, the In Vitro platoons were eventually
dissolved by the government and the "tanks" soon evolved into a rebellious race
of political untouchables.  The "navel" present at the back of their necks (where
the artificial umbilical cord was attached in the gestation chamber) became the
only visible distinguishing feature, making them easily recognizable and an easy
target of constant discrimination.
