	<p>

	Nathan is medavac-ed to the Saratoga, badly wounded after a fierce battle against
	the aliens which has apparently taken the lives of his comrades.  As Nathan
	recovers, his memory returns.  He then begins putting together the sequence of
	events leading to his evacuation, which reveal that the 58th is still alive.
	Nathan and McQueen then undertake a massive operation to rescue the 58th who still
	cling to hope while fending off superior enemy forces.
