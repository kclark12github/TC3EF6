	"We choose to go to the Moon not because it is easy, but because it is hard... the challenge is one we accept and one we intend to win."
	<p>

	<b>MISSION:</b> Reconnaissance patrol of two planets in the Indi 209100 Star System.
	<p>

	<b>SUMMARY:</b>
	Special forces US Army Green Berets, headed by Capt. Joyner, board SCVN USS
	Saratoga with a survivor discovered on Planet Tellus uttering "I'm the Farthest
	Man From Home." Howard Sewell (from Aerotech Board of Directors who had Nathan
	thrown off Tellus mission,) threatens to "reeducate" the prisoner during
	interrogation if he does not candidly speak of his time spend with the Aliens.
	Nathan, after learning from the prisoner that Kylen Celina might be alive, goes
	AWOL to Tellus to search for her.
	<p>

	Cooper and Shane fall out of their reconnaissance formation ('Go Elvis') to go
	after Nathan with McQueen's tacit blessing. Nathan finds Celina's locker with
	her personal belongings and a line up of photo-tags (w/ digital playback
	buttons) of those who survived... Kylen's message "Nathan, we're always
	together." He proceeds to a cave following her direction to "Look to the high
	ground," and discovers two additional Tellus survivors - Theresa Ashford and
	Yuko Kaya - living amongst alien graves. They confirm his suspicions that Kylen
	was taken by the aliens. Nathan plans to attack the campground of aliens
	holding other hostages, but abandons the search to rescue Cooper whose plane is
	shot down nearby.
	<p>

	Shane radios McQueen who then boards an APC (Armored Personnel Carrier) to
	Tellus and orders the rest of the 58th to 'cover' it. Following the rescue, the
	survivors are taken away by Sewell (their fate unknown) and the 58th's actions
	are classified "Code Red" (not to be acknowledged or discussed.) The squadron
	will not see Tellus for another 50 years.
