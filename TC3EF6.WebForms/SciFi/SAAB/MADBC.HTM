			Talk about your frequent flyers, by the time Bryan moved to the
			United States at age 14, he'd lived in The Philippines, India, Lebanon,
			Pakistan, Greece and Saudi Arabia.<P>
			
			After graduating American University with a degree in history, Bryan
			complied with his parents' request that he give up gainful employment
			and pursue a career in stand-up comedy and acting.  The rest, as they
			say, is history.  Callen has performed in several stage plays and
			independent films as well as appearing at the prestigious "Comic Strip"
			and "Stand Up New York" comedy clubs.<P>
			
			A talented impressionist in the tradition of Dana Carvey and Martin
			Short, check out Bryan's dead-on impersonation of <I>Seinfeld</I>'s
			Kramer in MAD's parody, "Clintfeld."<P></TD>
