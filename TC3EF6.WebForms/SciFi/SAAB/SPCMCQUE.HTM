	Nicknamed "Black Knight," McQueen is a battle veteran and commander of the 58th
	Squadron. Prior to leading the 58th, McQueen was in charge of the 127th Airborne
	(also called the 127th Attack Wing and the 127th Squadron), The Angry Angels.
	During one of the first battles of the Alien War, the 127th was decimated,
	leaving McQueen with burns over 20% of his body. Wise, tough and mysterious
	McQueen silently bonds with Cooper Hawkes as they watch a fight between the
	Angry Angels and the Marine recruits at Asteroid bar. Unlike the rebellious
	Cooper, however, McQueen has built a strong military career, displayed by his
	cool discipline and taciturn demeanor.</TD>
