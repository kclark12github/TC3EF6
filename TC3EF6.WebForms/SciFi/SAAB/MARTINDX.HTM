	<FONT SIZE=4><B>MARTIN</B>, a relationship comedy 
	starring multitalented comedian/actor/director Martin Lawrence, returns for its fourth 
	season when	newlyweds Martin (<A HREF="http://www.foxworld.com/martml.htm">Martin Lawrence</A>) and Gina 
	(<A HREF="http://www.foxworld.com/marttc.htm">Tisha	Campbell</A>) embark on their new life together as husband 
	and wife.  Yet as much as they love one other, each has a different perspective on the 
	road that  lies	ahead.  Martin isn't about to let the institution of marriage take  
	away his individuality or put a crimp in his lifestyle; Gina is perfectly  content with	
	settling down and moving into a new phase in her life.  One thing is for certain -- Ozzie 
	and Harriet they are not!<P>
	
	Lawrence plays Martin Payne, a wisecracking, macho man whose bark is far worse than his 
	bite.  Though he doesn't care to admit it, underneath his tough exterior
	is a sensitive guy who is all heart.  Martin works for Detroit's cable station 51
	as host of his own politically incorrect talk show, "Word on the
	Street."  As much as he loves serving up laughs and stirring up trouble,
	Martin's real passion is his beloved Gina, a marketing executive and career woman
	with a mind of her own.  As the only one who can keep Martin in check, Gina is his
	perfect counterpart, providing the "yin" to Martin's "yang."
	<P>
	Memories of their single days will not be forgotten with their close pals never far 
	behind: Pam (<A HREF="http://www.foxworld.com/martta.htm">Tichina  Arnold</a>) is Gina's quick-tongued, sassy 
	best friend, forever verbally dueling with Martin; Tommy (<A HREF="http://www.foxworld.com/marttf.htm">Thomas 
	Mikal Ford</a>) and Cole (<A HREF="http://www.foxworld.com/martap.htm">Carl Anthony Payne II</A>) are Martin's 
	ever-present buddies and comrades in the battle of the sexes.</FONT></TD>
