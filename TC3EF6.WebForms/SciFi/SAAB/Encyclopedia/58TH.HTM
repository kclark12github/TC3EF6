Name:           Shane Autumn Vansen
Rank:           Captain
Call Sign:      "Queen"
DOB:            2041
Education:      unknown
Serial Number:  560 51 03 3184
</pre>
During the <a href=/space:aab/encyclopedia/index.cgi?silicate>AI Wars</a> 
Shane saw her parents 
killed by a group of AIs in her home.  Since that time she has sheltered 
and mothered her two sisters.  She has grown weary of living for others 
and joined the Marines in memory of her parents and as an escape to the 
responsibility for the lives of her siblings.<p>

She has blossomed into the leader of the 58th.  Vansen is an 
effective leader, but her inter-personal skills leave something to be 
desired -- she is too intense.  She leaves the inner workings of the 
group to her XO <a href=/space:aab/chars/index.cgi?Weisser>Nathan 
West</a>.<p>

Shane has had bad luck with relationships, with her parents dead and her 
only serious love -- whats his name -- murdered by the Chigs, she is 
hesitant to let herself get close again to anyone except her family.  She 
is aware that <a href=/space:aab/chars/index.cgi?Rowland>Cooper 
Hawkes</a> is infatuated with her, but does not know what to do about 
it since he is a child in a man's body.

Name:           Paul Jacob Wang
Rank:           Lieutenant
Call Sign:      "Joker"
DOB:            2040
Education:      unknown
Serial Number:  948 30 34 828
</pre>
Paul Wang grew up with poverty in Chigaco.  He remembers waking up as a 
child with roaches over his body and on his face.  These memories have 
turned into a hated/phobia against cockroaches and bugs in general.
He is a football fan, and cruises the adult sections of the 
<cite>SpaceNet</cite> (as seen in Darkside of the Sun).<p>

He has an ongoing correspondance relationship on the 
<a href=/space:aab/encyclopedia/index.cgi?spacenet>SpaceNet</a>.  He 
seems to be shy and reclusive, and 
judges things by the worth he assigns them, not on what other might judge 
them.  For instance, being in love with someone he has never met is 
something that the other marines do not understand.  He has begun to 
grown personally, having relationships with 
<a href=/space:aab/chars/index.cgi?Bowen>Lt(jg) Stroud</a> and <a 
href=/space:aab/chars/index.cgi?Chapman>Lt Damphousse</a><p>


In <a href=/space:aab/episode/index.cgi?s1.e9>Hostile Visit</a>, we learn that 
Wang 
has a lucky shirt that he wears on missions to ensure that the 58th 
comes back.  However, this did not stop him from being tortured 
mercilessly by an <a href=/space:aab/chars/index.cgi?Hutchison>Elroy 
El</a> model AI.  He feels guilt for having broken under torture, and can 
see no way to redeem himself in the eyes of others -- or himself.

Name:           Tyrus Cassius McQueen
Rank:           Lieutenant Colonel

Age:            unknown
Education:      Mining / Marine Aviator
Serial Number:  2025 13C K9757 ANC (<a href=/space:aab/encyclopedia/index.cgi?invitro>InVitro</a>)
</pre>
TC McQueen was designed and gestated at the Anchorage facility.<p>

Orginally a miner on 
<a href=/space:aab/encyclopedia/index.cgi?omicron>Omicron draconis</a>, 
McQueen joined the USMC after the end of his indentured servitude. During 
the AI Wars, he was removed from the mines and became a munitions 
handler at <a href=/space:aab/encyclopedia/index.cgi?riskin>Port 
Riskin</a>.<p>

In the Marine Corps, he eventually became the CO of the 127th 
Fighter Squadron ("<a href=/space:aab/encyclopedia/index.cgi?angels>Angry 
Angels</a>"), but with their defeat and decimation after one of the 
inital skirmishes against the Chigs, he was left without a command.<p>

He is divorced from his wife due to the unsurmountable predjudice against 
him and his inability to procreate naturally.  McQueen lives his 
life by the tenets of many eastern philosophies, and will quote 
from them when the occasion presents itself.<p>

He suffers from an inner ear imbalance due to damage from his injuries 
from the the battle against the Chigs.  He was tortured at the 
hands of the AI and harbours a deep hatred for them.<p>

During the false peace negotiations, Ty lost his lower right leg due to an
explosion caused by a bomb smuggled in by the Chig Ambassador.  This
injury forced his return to Earth where he was given a Silicatronics
cybernetic leg and convelesced under the care of his ex-wife.<p>

He has returned to the USS Saratoga as a military advisor, since his
injuries preclude active duty.  He holds the official poistion of Marine
Tactical Deployment Officer, but unofficially he continues to groom the
Wildcards.

Rank:           Lieutenant
Call Sign:      "Jack"

Education:      Special Ops ("The Program")
Serial Number:  2040 16A A3439 PHL (<a href=/space:aab/encyclopedia/index.cgi?invitro>InVitro</a>) 
</pre>
Cooper Hawkes was designed and gestated at the Philadelphia facility.<p>

After nearly being hung, Cooper was found defending himself from the 
thugs that tried to kill him.  Still with the noose around his neck, he was 
stunned and arrested for aggrivated assault.  The judge was 'lenient' on 
him and sentenced him to a term in the Marine Corps.<p>

During boot training, Hawkes made friends with only one person: 
<a href=/space:aab/chars/index.cgi?pagodin>Pags</a>.  During the training 
mission to Mars, Pags was killed.  Hawkes has now sworn vengence against 
those who killed the only person that was nice to him.<p>

Hawkes has crush on <a href=guests.cgi?cloke>Vansen</a> but does not 
know how to socialize with people very well.  He is envious
<a href=guests.cgi?weisser>West</a> since he seems to be the major 
competion for Vansen's affections, but they get along alike brothers.<p>


Prior to joining the military, Hawkes escaped from 
"<a href=/space:aab/encyclopedia/index.cgi?ivprogram>The Program</a>" by 
killing a <a href=../encyclopedia/index.cgi?monitor>Monitor</a>.  The 
Program was supposedly disbanded, but it seems to have existed beyond its 
official closure -- training killers.<p>


He has a problem with authority, but will do the right thing.  In Mutiny, 
he killed 168 In_Vitros (including his 'sister') in order to save the 
humans onboard from the Chigs. Hawkes has become interested in finding 
out about his genetic siblings.

worked his way up the chain of command getting his star.<p>

Call Sign:      "King"
DOB:            2041
Education:      Colonist
Serial Number:  unknown
</pre>
Originaly part of the <a href=/space:aab/encyclopedia/index.cgi?tellus>Tellus</a> 
Colonization program with the woman he 
loved: <a href=/space:aab/chars/index.cgi?Douge>Kylen Celina</a>, Nathan's 
world was destroyed when he found that one 
of them could not go.  Politicians had decided that a minimum number of 
<a href=/space:aab/encyclopedia/index.cgi?invitro>InVitroes</a> must be on 
board, or the colony mission would be scrubbed.<p>

Not to be denied his dream, he tried to stow away on board during the 
launch.  However, he was caught and forced to complete his colonial 
indenture with the Marine Corps.<p>

Nathan has two brothers: <a href=/space:aab/chars/index.cgi?Warden>Neil</a> 
and John; and both his parents are still alive.  His whole family is 
pacifist, and does not approve his enrolment in the Marines.  They were 
devestated to find that Neil enlisted, and was killed withing months of 
Nathan's joining.  Kylen's father, wrought with grief over the possible 
death of his only daughter, has asked Nathan kill as many aliens as he can 
in retribution.<p>

Nathan is effectively the XO of the 58th, and has taken up a fraternal 
relationship with <a href=/space:aab/chars/index.cgi?Rowland>Hawkes</a>. 
He has matured incredibly since the time of his enlistment, and 
has become an exemplary office in the Marine Corps.
