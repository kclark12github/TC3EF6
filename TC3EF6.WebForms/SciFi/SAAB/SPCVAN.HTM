	As children, Shane and her younger sisters watched from the attic as Artificial
	Intelligence Rebels (human-like cyborgs originally built to serve humankind)
	broke into the Vansen home and executed her parents. In her own words, Shane
	explained why she joined the Marines, "I joined for me... my life. I don't want
	to take care of anyone for awhile." Shane's hatred and fear of the Al's, or
	Silicates, is the driving force in her life.</TD>
