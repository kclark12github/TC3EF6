	<p>

	Convinced Kylen may be among a handful of survivors of the attack on the Tellus
	Colony, Nathan commandeers a fighter craft and returns to the planet, where he
	encounters Alien resistance which prevents him from completing his rescue and
	nearly costs him his life.  however, he and the 58th also return with strong
	evidence of Kylen's survival and presumed abduction by the Alien forces.
