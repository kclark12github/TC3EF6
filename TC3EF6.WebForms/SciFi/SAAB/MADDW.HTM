			Debra Wilson never intended to be a comedienne, having studied drama at
			New York's prestigious High School of the Performing Arts and Syracuse
			University.<P>
			
			It was when she began performing sketch and improv comedy with a number
			of troupes in New York that her standout comedic talent became apparent.
			She quickly landed a role on <I>The Apollo Comedy Hour</I>,&nbsp; which was
			followed by stints on <I>The Uptown Comedy Club</I>&nbsp; and as Joan Rivers'
			sidekick on <I>Can We Shop</I>&nbsp;?<P>
			
			Debra's film credits include <I>Let It Be Me</I> &nbsp;with Patrick Stewart
			and <I>Blue in the Face</I> &nbsp;opposite Harvey Keitel and the most recent
			Spike Lee film, <I>Girl 6</I>.<P>
			
			As the conscience and confidante of millions of women, Oprah Winfrey is
			a prime target for some MAD TV mayhem.  In this sketch, Debra Wilson
			grabs the mike to let America know that, while everyone has problems, no
			one has more important problems than poor Oprah!<P></TD>
