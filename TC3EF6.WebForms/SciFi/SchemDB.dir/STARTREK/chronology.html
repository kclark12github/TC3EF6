Updated the famous <A HREF="images\ferengi\shuttle_unknown.jpg">Ferengi Shuttle Pod</A> first seen in <I>Next Generation</I> with an official schematic of the vessel, replacing my own sad rendition :-)

Update Part 2!  Here are all the remaining official schematics I've been able to find of other official miscellaneous races.  They can also be viewed in the <A HREF="cgi-bin\others.cgi.html#others">Other Miscellaneous and Non-Aligned Races/Organizations</A> section.  Enjoy...

<H3>1/15/2000</H3>
Happy New Year, everyone!  I know it's been a <B>LONG</B> wait...for some, longer than others...we'll get into that farther down, but I'm hoping it'll be worth it.  This first installation of new designs for the milleneal year are updates (and new submissions) of a large number of official designs, including schematics for all the vessels appearing in <B>Star Trek: Insurrection</B>.  I've subscribed to Paramount's official <B>Star Trek Fact Files</B> (imported from Europe) and the Official Magazine (local here in America).  Many of these publications have incredibly detailed and accurate schematics on designs I've only been able to duplicate with a VCR, a remote control, and Adobe PhotoShop.  After seeing the real stuff, I'm proud to say I wasn't far off on most of my personal designs, but it's nice to finally have something that can be called "official".  The second planned release (planned within the next month, or so) will be the kick-off of the new <B>Battlestar Galactica</B> schematics section, which I have put off for a long time, and I think that time has now finally come.  There aren't that many to begin with; the biggest challenge will be coming up with a web interface that captures the Colonial "environment", in keeping with the other interfaces I've built for this site.
<P>
On a personal note, I must say I'm a little disappointed with the flurry of emails complaining/whining about the "long" periods of time taken between releases.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again (at the risk of sounding whiney myself).  Don't send me these kinds of emails, as they WILL ALL go unanswered!  I know this message will likely fall on deaf ears, but I can only try.  You see, I have a 40+ hour-a-week job, a Web-developement job on the side, I'm a re-enactor, and I participate in various fraternal organizations.  Quite frankly, I've seen web-sites run by people that do a fraction of what I do, and don't do nearly as many updates as I do.  So what's the problem here, people?  I get these pesky emails and I sometimes wonder why I continue work on the database.  I come to the conclusion that it's for the contributing non-leech users of the database who have worked long hours to help make this website possible.  It's for the people who aren't just looking for the latest update.  So, to re-iterate, if you are one of these leeches, don't waste your time sending these emails anymore, as they will go answered.  You might even find yourself locked out if I ever get the time to build a security system in to the page (insert evil grin here).  So please don't let it come to that and become a part of the solution, and not a part of the problem.  Anyways, enough unpleasantness...
<P>

After a long hiatus of moving into a new townhouse and starting up a business, I've found the time to push out a large chunk of the backlog of starship designs I've been collecting over the past six months.  There are more, to be sure.  I'll be updating a large number of my official designs, among other things.

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>7/12/1999</H3>
We're back!  Please refer to the <A HREF="..\chronology.html">Main
Chronology</A> for a low-down on what's been going on.  Pretty soon, I'll
be adding some new Trek designs which will be showcased here upon
completion as soon as I get them finished.

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>11/11/1998</H3>
<B>IMPORTANT NEWS:</B> There is the possibility that in the very near future, the site is going to go down to be moved to a new location.  There is no telling when it will be back up again, so my official word on this at present is an indefinite outage.
<P>
As one of my favorite authors would say, however, DON'T PANIC!  I'm not disappearing off the face of the earth, and Paramount hasn't stomped me into fine granules.  This is merely a technical issue only.  Hopefully, there will be plenty of time for this update to circulate and let enough people know about this turn of events.  Consequently, any whiny emails asking where the site went will go unanswered!  I've grown quite weary of such mindless correspondence in the past year.  I will, however, continue to receive legitimate emails regarding starship design and submissions, as well as make plans for the new Battlestar Galactica section.  Until that time, please sit tight, be patient and be well.

In other news, there's a new game in town (if it can be called a game?)-- Star Trek: Starship Creator from Simon & Schuster.  It appears to be a starship designer's dream.  Build your own ships and put them in their own missions, running in the background.  Almost like a Sim-Trek kind-of thing.  Don't know if it will be as extensive as Star Trek TNG: The Birth of the Federation from MicroProse (that one sounds more like a Civ II in the Star Trek Universe).  The reason I'm particularly interested in this one, is because it's the first piece of software ever made commercially which is 100% dedicated to starship design and development.  It's also being made for the Macintosh, as well as the PC, which makes me happy :-)  More on that later in the form of a review.

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>10/16/1998</H3>
In addendum to my October 1 update, I have added a small, yet significant change to the database.  Thanks to Mark Starling and user "Starship Voyager", I finally obtained a copy of the official schematics to the <A HREF="images\federation\tacticalcruiser_prometheus.jpg"><I>U.S.S. Prometheus</I></A> from the <I>Voyager</I> episode "Message in a Bottle".  It was taken from the mysterious non-American Star Trek Fact Files, to which I am currently trying to get an international subscription.  Wish me luck.  This one's much sleeker than my original rendition...I like it!  Enjoy.

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>10/1/1998</H3>
It's been exactly a month, and I have a number of milestones to announce:
<UL>
<LI>First of all, the site just broke 50,000 users today at exactly 18:57 (6:57 PM) Eastern Standard Time with a hit from Joseph Richter!  Many thanks go to Joseph and all the many other users of the database to make it one of the most popular fan-run Trek sites on the 'Web.
<LI>Second, not only did the database break 1,000 schematics, it broke 1,100!  I've been procuring a number of designs with the hope that I could time their release with the 50,000th hit, and I'm happy to say it went off without a hitch.  Thanks go to my regular submitters, including James P. Beery, Eric C. Fahrner, Adam Heinbuch, Bobby Jones, Jim Leary, Toni Pienonen, P.T. Riley, Bernd Schneider, Rutger Warrink and all the hundreds of other site users for giving the database just the boost it needed to kick it over the top.
<LI>Third, by EXTREMELY popular demand, I have added ships from the <A HREF="cgi-bin\others.cgi.html#vulcan">Vulcan Navy</A>, going as far back as the <I>T'Plana Hath</I> Warp Ship from <I>Star Trek: First Contact</I>, up to the <I>T'Pau</I> from TNG's "Unification" Two-Parter.  This brings me to a debate that's been going on via the internet for the past month or so.  I have been told by numerous sources that the Vulcan <A HREF="images\vulcan\cruiser_t'pau.jpg"><I>T'Pau</I></A>-class Cruiser in fact belongs to the officially-named (and rather unconventionally-designed) <I>Apollo</I>-class Cruiser in the Star Trek Encyclopedia (Second Edition).  I have been told that a direct correspondence exists between these two vessels.  Y'know what?  It's true.  If you have the Encyclopedia, on page 475, you will see the T'Pau registered in the starship listing as a member of the <A HREF="images\federation\cruiser_apollo1.jpg"><I>Apollo</I></A>-class, which has been accordingly updated as being the official design for that vessel.
<LI>Fourth, and possibly most significant, I have registered the domain <B><A HREF="..\index.html">WWW.SHIPSCHEMATICS.NET</A></B> for the database.  I figured it was that one last thing that needed to be done in order to make this a full-blown quality site.  The "destroyer" address will still work, but if local addresses/servers ever need to change, using the new domain name will (or, at the very least, should) make such a change appear seamless to the web user.  Please make a note of it.
</UL>
<P>
We have several Federation updates/accurizations:
<UL>
<LI>From Gerard Gillan, we at last have the <B>OFFICIAL</B> schematic of the <A HREF="images\federation\scout_freedom.jpg"><I>Freedom</I></A>-class scout as seen in the distance in TNG's "Best of Both Worlds" 2-parter.  How do I know it's official?  It came from Paramount's foreign-release magazine <B>Star Trek Fact Files</B> which is not available in the United States!  Why, you ask?  Beats the h*ll outta me!  I've found it available in England, Scotland, Germany (and other German speaking countries), Australia and New Zealand.  There is also an official schematic of the <I>Prometheus</I> that I hope to get my hands on, soon, to replace (or at the very least update) the one I did for accuracy's sake.
<LI>From Adam Heinbuch, we have a fantastic high-detail rendered version of the Pre-TOS <A HREF="images\federation\cruiser_daedalus.jpg"><I>Daedalus</I></A>-class Cruiser.
<LI>And from Craig Hanus, we have an updated <A HREF="images\federation\shuttlepod_type20.jpg"><I>Type 20 ShuttlePod</I></A> from the DS9 episode "The Sound of Her Voice".
</UL>

Hey, all.  Sorry for the down-time.  I realized recently that it'll probably take more than just a month to get around to rebuilding the server, so I decided that it would be in everybody's best interests if I brought the database back on its feet again.  I have made special arrangements with the system administrators of this machine to enable me to reboot it if the site goes south again.  I will be making periodic updates to the Chronology section, so keep watching.  I <B>WILL</B> be taking down the site at some point in the near future to rebuild the server - so <FONT COLOR="Red"><B>BE WARNED!</B></FONT>.  In the meantime, go back to enjoying the schematics.
<P>
<B>In other news:</B> I have registered this site with InterNic, and will be creating a new domain specifically to this database.  Keep watching for details on that one.  <B>AND!</B>  I've had a large number of emails requesting a <I>Vulcan</I> section.  As they have so few ships associated with the Vulcans, and as I have received these emails, I <B>WILL</B> be including the Vulcans in the next release in a few weeks, along with a pile of new Federation and Klingon designs.  We're getting close to two milestones with this site: 1) Reaching the 50,000 user mark, and 2) Reaching the 1,000 ship schematic mark.  I hope to make those two events happen simultaneously, so keep the designs coming!

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>8/21/1998</H3>
Got a few Federation leftovers which needed including, such as the <A HREF="images\federation\battleship_america.jpg"><I>America</I></A>-class Battleship from Entente Systems and the much sought-after <A HREF="images\federation\timeship_aeon.jpg"><I>Timeship Aeon</I></A> from the 29th Century, as introduced in the <I>Voyager</I> episodes "Future's End" Parts I & II.
<P>
In the Klingon section, I've added the <A HREF="images\klingon\freighter_noggra.jpg">Freighter</A> owned by the House Noggra from the <I>DS9</I> episode "Sons of Mogh".  Anybody got an official name on this one?
<P>
Last but not least, I've added the <A HREF="images\ferengi\ferengi_shuttle.jpg.html">Ferengi Shuttle</A> we see occasionally in <I>Next Generation</I> and <I>DS9</I>.  Looking for a name for this ship, too.  Enjoy...

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>8/20/1998</H3>
Added more Federation designs.
<P>
In the Klingon section we have two new ships, the <A HREF="images\klingon\heavycruiser_hood.jpg"><I>I.K.V. Hood</I></A> from Jim Leary (which has an interesting story behind it, included in the image), and the <A HREF="images\klingon\dreadnaught_bat'leth.jpg"><I>Bat'Leth</I>-class Dreadnaught</A> from <A HREF="http://www.imcnet.net/~kahless/">USS Dark Star</A>.
<P>
The Romulan section has the new <A HREF="images\romulan\drydock_aerv.jpg"><I>Aerv</I>-class Drydock</A> from Toni Pienonen.
<P>
...And last but not least, the <A HREF="images\altuniverse\galaxyconquest_nemesis.jpg"><I>Nemesis</I>-class Galaxy Conquest Vessel</A> in the Alternate Universe section from Erik Fromme.

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>8/3/1998</H3>
<P>
I'm back with a few more Federation additions, including some official dock and station designs.
<P>
Many thanks to Adam Heinbuch for reminding me about <A HREF="images\federation\drydock_utopia.jpg">Space Station (Drydock) <I>McKinley</I></A> (of the <I>Utopia</I>-class) and the <A HREF="images\federation\drydock_antares.jpg"><I>Antares Shipyards Drydock</I> from Star Trek: Generations</A>.  Thanks to Toni Pienonen for passing the name of that drydock on to me for the database.
<P>
Also added a conceptual design of what the <I><A HREF="images\altuniverse\heavycruiser_enterprise.jpg">I.S.S. Enterprise</A></I> would look like after being upgraded in the "Mirror Universe".  Thanks to Jim Leary for his submission.  Until next time...

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>8/1/1998</H3>
<P>
Big things have been going on recently.  I've just completed and installed the first version of the "Small Craft" and "Docks/Stations" sections of the various organizations within the database.  Here's a breakdown of the new sections:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="cgi-bin\federation.cgi17.html">Federation Small Craft</A>
<LI><A HREF="cgi-bin\federation.cgi14.html">Federation Docks/Stations</A>
<LI><A HREF="cgi-bin\klingon.cgi13.html">Klingon Small Craft</A> (Was Warpshuttles)
<LI><A HREF="cgi-bin\klingon.cgi15.html">Klingon Docks/Stations</A>
<LI><A HREF="cgi-bin\romulan.cgi13.html">Romulan Small Craft</A> (Was Warpshuttles)
<LI><A HREF="cgi-bin\romulan.cgi15.html">Romulan Docks/Stations</A>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Small Craft</I> includes all fighters, shuttles, work bees, and any other smaller-than-starship vehicles.  This line gets fuzzy with <I>Runabouts</I>, as I have heard people claim they are considered starships, because of the "NCC" designation in their registry.  I personally disagree, as I have some other shuttle-type designs in the database with "NCC" registries as well.  To me, <I>Runabouts</I> are just oversized shuttlecraft and will be treated as such for the purposes of this database.
<P>
<I>Docks/Stations</I> includes all spacedocks, drydocks, and space stations of any available type.  Let me know if I missed anything, but I think I got just about everything.
<P>
Anyway, there it is!  The interfaces have been accordingly changed to accommodate the new configuration.  I may do a few small updates here & there down the road, but I think it's time for another vacation away from the site.  I will be answering emails & collecting new designs as usual, but I don't suspect I'll be making any more major updates (such as the <I>Small Craft</I> and <I>Docks/Stations</I> sections) for a while.  In the meantime, enjoy the new stuff!  See ya!

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>7/31/1998</H3>
<P>
Welcome back everyone!  I'm almost ready to install the new Small Craft and Stations/Docks sections.  I still need to do a little more work with the interfaces to accommodate the new sections.  In the meantime, I have taken the liberty of collecting a few more new starship designs for display, including the long sought-after official <I><A HREF="images\federation\freighter_merchantman.jpg.html">Merchantman</A></I>-class Freighter from Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.
<P>
<A NAME="raptor">
<B>Romulan Update!</B> Discovered that the Romulan warp shuttle as seen in the DS9 episode "In the Pale Moonlight" is called a <I><A HREF="images\romulan\warpshuttle_h10.jpg">Raptor</A></I>-class warp shuttle.  Thanks to my users for this information.
<P>
<B>Cardassian Update!</B> My loyal users have also informed me that my image of the Cardassian Freighter <I><A HREF="images\cardassians\freighter_groumall.jpg">Groumall</A></I> was, in fact, upside-down!  That's because I scanned it from the <I>Star Trek Encyclopedia</I>, which is what had it upside-down to begin with (along with the <A HREF="images\dominion\dominion_battlecruiser.jpg">Jem'Hadar Battlecruiser</A>).  Even though there really is no such thing as upside-down in space, I decided, nonetheless, to flip it vertically to match the orientation of the studio model.  I have also included a view of the much asked-for <A HREF="images\cardassians\weaponsplatform_unknown.jpg">Cardassian Weapons Platform</A> from the DS9 season finale "Tears of the Prophets".  As nobody really knows if this thing has a class-name associated with it, it will be listed as "Unknown" for now.
<P>
<B>Tholian Update!</B> Added the new <A HREF="images\tholian\tholian_lightfighter.jpg">Tholian Light Fighter</A>.
<P>
<B>Gorn Update!</B> Added the new <A HREF="images\gorn\gorn_lightfighter.jpg">Gorn Light Fighter</A>.
<P>
For the extra-observant, you may have noticed a little icon on the Main Page of this site that looks something like this:<A HREF="http://usa.nedstat.net/cgi-bin/viewstat?name=schematics"><IMG SRC="" BORDER=0 ALT="Site Statistics" WIDTH=22 HEIGHT=22></A>
This is something new that I added, a link to a web statistics site called <B><I><A HREF="http://usa.nedstat.net/">NedStat</A></I></B>.  It records hits and builds averages.  Makes it easy to find out what kind of the usage the site has been getting, and gives a general idea of who is using it (sorted by domains, not IP addresses for the privacy-minded individuals out there) and when.  Pretty nifty, I think.  I've been seeing a lot more people using this service everywhere around the web...figured I'd jump on the bandwagon, too :-)

<B>We're back up and running!</B>
<P>
Well, it would appear that the worst thing that can happen to a person with a computer happened to me on Saturday morning.  What would have been an otherwise normal weekend turned into a complete nightmare.  I was in the process of composing the last few remaining starship designs for the newest release, when I fell prey to an unprecedented hard drive failure on my removable disk.  I consider it unprecedented, because in all my seventeen years of computing, I have never experienced such a complete failure of hardware and software.
<P>
I tried doing a simple file search for a particular file (an existing schematic which was similar to a newer one that was recently submitted), and I wanted to cut & paste pieces from it to create the new schematic.  Pretty basic, eh?  Well, when the system began searching on my removable media (where all my Web-related data was stored - FIVE YEAR'S WORTH), the system hung irretrievably.  I hit the reset button, only to find that upon rebooting, some bizarre read-write cycle began when the removable drive tried mounting to the desktop.  Thinking it was just some way of fixing itself, I let it do its thing and went to watch TV for 40 minutes, only to return to a still-spinning disk.  I couldn't escape out of the cycle, so I - regretfully - hit the reset button again.
<P>
This time, the thing wouldn't even mount.  It was COMPLETELY hosed!  So, I pulled Old Faithful off the shelf & blew off the dust: Norton's Utilities to the rescue!  I succeeded in fixing the Boot Sector, but the File Allocation Table was totally trashed.  After finally being able to mount the disk, I saw ZERO FILES visible!!?!?  Again, bringing up the Norton's Utilities, I went to the Undeleter, where I successfully retrieved 80% of the 4000+ (hidden) files I lost, but with a catch: Since the Directory Tree was fried, every single file was labeled with some strange compu-speak nomenclature, like "JPEG #2183.data", or "GIF #2112.data".  I spent the rest of the weekend going through each and every file to see how it should be named, where it should be placed, or even if it survived the whole process altogether.
<P>
Imagine a castle which has just been blown away by cannon-fire.  80% of the stones are laying about your feet, and not a single stone sits on top of any other stone.  That was the task I had to overcome.  Needless to say, I had to take down this site temporarily to make a new backup of my web data, taking advantage of full bandwidth capabilities.  What was originally intended to be my backup (the removable hard-drive), wound up relying on my originals on the web for backup.  Savor the irony.  In any case, the site is back up and running, as is my system.  I am going to invest in a new CD-ROM cutter to minimize the pain if this ever happens again.  I was planning on making my new release this week, but due to the technical difficulties, I'm going to have to postpone that release for another few weeks, as my window for such opportunity has become quite slim.  Thank you for your patience, and I'll get back to you soon.

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<P>
Had a small glitch in the system, possibly because of the sporadic thunderstorms we've been having recently in the area (Northern Virginia).  I have been getting an inordinate number of emails informing me that the website is down.  Although I am grateful for your concern, I will now include an excerpt from the <A HREF="faq.html">F.A.Q.</A>, which should be read before using this site for any extended period of time:
<P>
PLEASE DO NOT SEND ME AN EMAIL SAYING THE SERVER IS DOWN!  Sometimes this happens, be it a full swap disk, or a web server crash, etc. etc.  I check the site periodically almost every day, to verify the status.  If I find it's down, I will contact the sys-admins and have them do a reboot.  So, since I get 200-300 hits a day, and if 10% of those hits tell me the server's down, that's at least 20-30 emails I have to sift through and reply why it went down.  It's much easier to do one update to the Chronology section explaining the downtime, than returning 30 emails.
<P>
Still working on small craft and stations/docks.  I don't think anyone will be disappointed with what I come up with.  Even I was surprised out how many such designs there were.  Consequently, it has taken me longer than I previously estimated to complete these sections for the Federation, as well as the other races/organizations.  Stay tuned, and <B>PLEASE</B> read the <A HREF="faq.html">F.A.Q.</A>

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>6/18/1998</H3>
<P>
It's been another long while, but I hope it was worth the wait.  I've added the remaining set of ships from other races, and once again cleared my desk of pending federation starship designs.
<P>
Updated <A HREF="images\romulan\warpshuttle_h10.jpg">Vreenak's Warpshuttle</A> from the DS9 episode "In the Pale Moonlight" thanks to Rutger Warrink.
<P>
Last but certainly not least, we have more miscellaneous vessels from the "Others" section that many people have been looking for, including the very elusive <I><A HREF="images\maquis\fighter_peregrine.jpg">Peregrine</A></I>-class fighter (which also happens to have been used as an Academy Flight Trainer - or at least so says the <I>Star Trek Encyclopedia</I>) and the extremely popular <A HREF="images\dominion\dominion_attackship.jpg">Jem'Hadar attack ship</A>.
<P>
In other news: This site has been nominated to be the Internet Collectibles Awards Star Trek Site of the Year.  <A HREF="http://www.collectiblenet.com/ica/">Cast your vote for this site</A>!  All help is appreciated - I know I have the users to make a serious dent in their voting poll.
<P>
Also!  I now set out to do what many people have asked me in the past (and I'm finally getting around to doing it):  I am now going to add small craft (i.e. shuttles, fighters, etc.), starbases, space stations, and drydocks to the Federation section (and continue to do so in the other sections).  It will take me a while, so please don't send me emails asking where I am :-)  Thanks, and I'll see you in a month or two.

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>5/25/1998</H3>
<P>
Had another bizarre hiccup with the Netscape server, but it seems to be functioning normally again.  Anyway, added a couple new Federation designs <B>including and featuring</B> the <I><A HREF="images\federation\galexploration_dauntless.jpg">U.S.S. Dauntless</A></I>.
<P>
Now, as we know (we, meaning those of us who saw the <I>Voyager</I> episode "Hope and Fear"), the <I>Dauntless</I> is not really a Federation Ship.  It was built by one of the many wacko races bent on the destruction of <I>Voyager</I> for screwing up their planet, or whatever.  But, since the <I>Dauntless</I> was built with Starfleet ship design in mind (and since everyone has been screaming for this schematic), I have added it to the database with a small footnote in the entry saying "Non-Federation", classified as "Galaxy Exploration" (since it was ultimately designed to replace <I>Voyager</I>).
<P>
Also added the <A HREF="images\romulan\warpshuttle_h10.jpg">Romulan Warpshuttle</A> from the <I>DS9</I> Episode "In the Pale Moonlight".  It is <B>highly</B> inaccurate, as there were very few views of this ship shown during that episode.  I only hope that it shows up again later in the series - especially now that the Romulans have entered in the War against the Dominion.  So, for what it's worth, here's the new Romulan shuttle - I was tempted to call it the <I>Fett</I>-class Warpshuttle, because of its cockpit design :-)  <B>NOTE:</B> Found the true name of this warpshuttle.  Refer to the <A HREF="#raptor">7/31/1998 Update</A> for the info.

<P>
Created two new significant additions to the database today.
<P>
The first is the <A HREF="images\federation\heavycruiser_goodson.jpg"><I>Goodson</I></A>-class heavy cruiser; an interesting design, originating as a concept sketch from the producers of <I>Star Trek: First Contact</I>.  As no ship name was associated with it, I christened her the <I>U.S.S. Goodson</I>, after her designer John Goodson.
<P>
The second is a ship that many of us have seen recently: the <A HREF="images\federation\warship_voyager.jpg"><I>Warship Voyager</I></A>, as seen in the <I>Star Trek: Voyager</I> episode "Living Witness".  As actual footage of the ship lasted for no more than 5-10 seconds (and a full view of the vessel was never shown), I tried my best to capture the extreme beweaponment that adorned this alternate-<I>Voyager</I>.  I hope everyone approves.

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>5/15/1998</H3>
Broke 15000 hits!  Another record!  1000 hits in 2 days.
<P>
Someone just sent me the first email regarding the differences between <A HREF="images\federation\escortcruiser_defiant.jpg.html"><I>Defiant</I></A> and <A HREF="images\federation\escortcruiser_valiant.jpg"><I>Valiant</I></A>, in both my database, and in the show, as what I have in my database is <I>clearly</I> not what we saw in the recent <I>DS9</I> episode "The Valiant".  I will attempt to explain this difference as adequately as possible.
<P>
The <I>"Valiant"</I> I have in my database is, in fact, the prototype/conceptual design that eventually became to be known as the <I>Defiant</I>.  As a matter of fact, I had heard that the producers of the show unofficially called the <I>Defiant</I> a <I>Valiant</I>-class ship (or maybe the ship was originally supposed to be called the <I>Valiant</I> - I can't remember which).  You can even see that older version of the <I>Valiant</I> on various schematics and "Okuda-grams" scattered here-and-there around the bridge of the <I>Defiant</I> (if you have a VCR with a good pause and a quick eye), no doubt because the bridge set was built before they finalized the starship design.  Hope this helps people understand the difference.
<P>
Added several new Federation, Klingon and Romulan Ships to the list and updated a few Federation Ships.

Well, it's been a relaxing couple of months and the site broke 14,000 users in that time!  <B>AMAZING!</B>  But playtime is now over, and it's time to start catching up on some new business.  The first thing you might notice that has changed is the addition of a new section: <A HREF="webrings.html">WebRings</A>.  I've been invited into a new WebRing: the <I>Final Frontier</I>, which also specializes in starship design.  I decided to add the new section in case others find my site worthy of addition to their webring (and also so I don't clutter up the main home page :-) ).  The second thing you may or may not notice, is the fact that all image filenames are now 32 characters in length.  The reasons for this are two-fold...  First: This allows Macintosh users (such as myself) to download the images, and not have to rename/truncate their names.  Second, (and for COMPLETELY selfish reasons) it makes it easier for me to store the individual images on a Mac-formatted removable hard-drive for backup purposes, instead of hiding them all in one big, nebulous, difficult-to-access TAR file, that only a UNIX gnome would love.  I have compiled a new group of submitted starships to be placed in the database sometime this weekend...more on that later.

Oops!  Some pesky cron-job (or something) killed the server at exactly Midnight and 9 seconds last night.  We're not quite sure what, but as of 8:59:03 this morning, we seem to be back up and running.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  I just have to sift through all my email now telling me that the server is down :-)

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>3/15/1998</H3>
Happy Birthday to the site!  As one of my users, Adam Heinbuch has pointed out, I began development on this site exactly one year ago today.  To celebrate, I have included the last of the major pieces of the site - the long-awaited <A HREF="romulan.html"><B>ROMULANS</B></A>!  This particular section currently has 45 ships in it - mostly from the Romulan Ship Recognition Manual from FASA, interleaved with a few others.  This should keep you users busy for a while, as I'm going to be a taking a <B>LONG</B> vacation from the site.  I've been up until 3:00 in the morning for the past week cleaning out all the backed up files that people have been asking for along with building the Romulan section, so now I'm taking some time off.  I will continue to accept any emails sent to me, and build up the queue once again for a future release - maybe a month or two from now.  Until then, enjoy the new section.

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>3/14/1998</H3>
At last, I have cleared my "desk" of pending Federation designs...for now :-)  I have three new ships, including Zefram Cochrane's <I><A HREF="images\federation\warpship_phoenix.jpg">Phoenix</A></I> Warpship.  I figured that it was fitting to add the first warp vessel to ever precede the rest of the ships in my database, and the users were asking for it as well.  It's the only Pre-Federation, Pre-UESPA ship in the database.
<P>
I've now begun the long journey of building the Romulan section, now long overdue.  I should have the interface built tomorrow, along with the first wave of designs.  There aren't too many, so I'm hoping to get all of the designs in at once.  Stay tuned...

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>3/13/1998</H3>
Added YET EVEN MORE new Federation ships.

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>3/11/1998</H3>
Added graphics for the timeline search feature in the Federation section.  Also received a few bits of email regarding the <A HREF="images\federation\scout_yeager.jpg"><I>Yeager</I></A>-class Scout.  I've been told that the original version of the model did in fact have only two engines.  I had mine with three.  So, I removed the third engine from the <I>Yeager</I>, and created a new 3-engine variant - the <A HREF="images\federation\superscout_glenn.jpg"><I>Glenn</I></A>-class Super Scout, just for completeness' sake.  Also updated the <A HREF="images\federation\tacticalcruiser_eclipse.jpg"><I>Eclipse</I></A>-class Tactical Command Cruiser to include front and bottom views.
<P>
<B>INFO REQUEST:</B> Does anyone know what class the <I>S.S. Raven</I> belonged to?  This was a ship seen (kind-of) in the <I>Voyager</I> episode "Raven", registry number NAR-32450.  It was the vessel that Seven-of-Nine's family was in when it crashed and was attacked by the Borg.  From what I have heard, it is not any previously seen design (<I>Oberth</I>, <I>Miranda</I> or otherwise), it's completely new - and was allegedly thrown together at the last minute, according to official sources.  Any help appreciated... <A HREF="mailto:jstevens@patriot.net">Please mail me</A> if anyone has any insight on this ship.
<P>
Also added some more of the "unofficially official" ships along with a bunch of submitted designs from P.T. Riley and other users of the site.

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>3/7/1998</H3>
No Romulans this weekend yet...sorry 'bout that.  I just had too much of a backlog of new Federation designs being submitted via email, and I'm still not done yet!  =whew!=  Anyway, I received a tremendous response with regards to the alleged "official" designs mentioned in the <I>Star Trek Encyclopedia</I>.  I question their officiality at this point, as I have, in some cases, received multiple designs for the same ship!  I'll likely determine officiality when I get confirmation of these designs via official means...whatever or however that may happen.  But, for the time being, here they are (so far):
<P>
Also added some new official and non-official designs and made accurization updates to various ships.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>DISCLAIMER</B></FONT>: To the designers that apply: Some of the designs above have John Gurzick's name attached to them for no other reason than he was the one that brought them to me.  This <I>in no way</I> implies that he was the original designer of said designs - he just didn't have any source info on some of the ships he sent me.  If any designers of these (or any other, for that matter) schematics come to me and say "Hey!  You $%*$&*!  I made this!", <A HREF="mailto:jstevens@patriot.net">let me know</A> and I will change credit accordingly.  This is in no way meant to be a slight towards either the original designers OR John.  I appreciate all submissions sent, and I want to make sure that everyone is appropriately credited, the best I can.

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>3/5/1998</H3>
Had a slight glitch w/ the server.  Some of you who tried pinging the site today may have gotten an "Access Forbidden" error.  I contacted the system administrators and all it needed was a restart.  Everything seems to be running fine now (as of 15:20, EST).  Sorry about the downtime, but it does happen occasionally.
<P>
In other news: Finally added hit-counter, time and date displays.  I started it off at 1000, as I know for a fact that I've gotten at least that many hits based on the emails and cgi-bin calls I've been seeing :-)

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>3/4/1998</H3>
Well, after a month-long hiatus, I've started up production again, with one major change, and a minor one.  First, the major change: You might now notice, in the Federation section, that there is an extra column for each ship.  This denotes the <I>Era</I> in which each ship has appeared (for official designs), or is likely to have appeared (for non-official designs).
<P>
This column contains (for now) four values:
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=4 CELLPADDING=4>
<TR>
<TH ALIGN=RIGHT>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Pre-TOS</FONT>
</TH>
<TD>
For ships that look as if they were built before the timeframe of The Original Series.
</TH>
</TD>
<TR>
<TH ALIGN=RIGHT>
<FONT COLOR="#CC0000">TOS</FONT>
</TH>
<TD>
For ships that look as if they were built during The Original Series.  This also includes The Animated Series.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TH ALIGN=RIGHT>
<FONT COLOR="#004400">Movies</FONT>
</TH>
<TD>
For ships that look as if they were built during The Movies (from <I>Star Trek: The Motion Picture</I> to <I>Star Trek VII: Generations</I>).
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TH ALIGN=RIGHT>
<FONT COLOR="#0000CC">TNG</FONT>
</TH>
<TD>
For ships that look as if they were built immediately before (i.e. <I>Ambassador</I>-class and variants thereof), during, and after <I>Star Trek: The Next Generation</I>.  This includes ships seen in (or look as if they might have been built during the time of) The Movies <I>Star Trek: Generations & First Contact</I>, the <I>Voyager</I> and <I>Deep Space Nine</I> Series and beyond...
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
Only official ships will have multiple entries, as we see ships like the <I>Mirandas, Excelsiors, Oberths,</I> etc. appearing as early as the movies to as late as Next Gen, DS9, and beyond.  The time period to which unofficial ships belong is largely determined by the latest piece of technology shown on the vessel.  By "latest piece", I mean that there are some designs which are made up of components of ships which span timelines.  For example, the <A HREF="images\federation\dreadnaught_alliance.jpg.html"><I>U.S.S. Alliance</I></A>-class dreadnaught is largely a Movie-era starship, based on the <A HREF="images\federation\heavycruiser_enterprise-b.jpg"><I>Enterprise-B</I></A>.  However, the <I>Alliance</I> also happens to have a <A HREF="images\federation\tacticalcruiser_nebula.jpg"><I>Nebula</I></A>-style weapons pod, which is obviously a TNG-era design.  Since that pod does not exist in Movie-era time, we assume that the <I>Alliance</I> was a ship built during the time of TNG.  Many thanks to Gregory Bain for this great idea.  A graphical timeline in the main Federation section will be installed to help facilitate this new functionality.
<P>
And last, but certainly not least, the small but significant change: With the help of John Gurzick, I've found that the previously-unknown thru-deck carrier, as seen in the DS9 episode "A Time to Stand", belongs to the <A HREF="images\federation\thrudeckcarrier_shelley.jpg"><I>Shelley</I></A>-class, and is now listed as being in the TNG era, and Movie era (for of its use of <I>Miranda</I> and early <I>Star Trek III</I>-variant <I>Excelsior</I> parts).

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>2/10/1998</H3>
Added a new section: It's entitled <A HREF="rr&a.html">References, Reviews & Awards</A>.  I've been getting some emails from various organizations wanting to add links to this site, review it & nominate it for awards.  So, in preparation for the future, I have added this particular section to accommodate this new (and hopefully growing) aspect of the Schematics Page.  The first thing you may have noticed when linking to this site is my new membership in the <A HREF="http://homepage.tinet.ie/~jeffrey/sdring.htm">Starship Design WebRing</A>, consisting of other pages dedicated to the pursuit of schematics.  The other prominent addition thus far is a link to <A HREF="http://oneclick.msn.com/">One Click Away</A> Online Magazine, which has added a link to this site in the <I>CelebritySurf</I> section.
<P>
Added some new ships and updated a few others.
<P>
ALSO!  Does anyone have any information on the following classes:
<UL>
<LI>Chimera Class
<LI>Yorkshire Class
<LI>Zodiac Class
</UL>
Ships from some of these classes were allegedly "seen" at Wolf 359 and are all mentioned in the <I>Star Trek Encyclopedia</I> by Michael and Denise Okuda, so they would all be considered official designs.  Anyone with info on these, please <A HREF="mailto:jstevens@patriot.net">mail me</A>.  Thanks...

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>2/2/1998</H3>
Hey, all.  I'm going to get on my soapbox a little.  I just got back from a grueling weekend at a World War II re-enactment at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, only to find this flurry of emails telling me of an individual who took a copy of the <I>Prometheus</I> schematics I drew, and resubmitted it to another web site claiming it to be his.  As I progressed through the emails I received that weekend, I found that the situation had pretty much resolved itself, with the guilty party admitting the plagiarism.  I think I found this activity on the part of this individual somewhat disturbing.  Aren't we trying to prove to the Paramount/ViaCom juggernaut that we fans of the Trek Universe are not a bunch of stealing, lying bastards claiming other's work as our own?  Must we have people out there proving their case for them?!?  I have NO problem with people taking images from my site and republishing them <B>AS LONG AS THEY GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!!</B>  I went to great lengths to make my bibliography section as up-to-date and complete as possible, siting all credits (where available).  I expect no less from anyone else who chooses to use data from this database.  I'm going to come off my soapbox now, but not before thanking the users of this site who brought this to my attention, as well as the site managers of the web pages where my <I>Prometheus</I> schematic wound up, for lack of a better word, illegally.  All people involved acted in an extremely professional manner, and took care of the problem without the need for me to get involved.  Thanks to all those watching my back.  It is appreciated.  And to that person who took that image, you know who you are, as do I and several others.  Maybe you should try getting hired by ViaCom to shut down all the non-official, non-MicroSoft Star Trek sites, you're doing such a good job of proving their argument, already.
<P>
On a more personal note, I have been receiving a lot of emails, lately, asking me why I'm taking so long in updating images or putting their submitted designs on the page.  Please keep in mind that I do have a 40-hour-a-week job, taking most of my time.  I just got a new (used) car which is taking me a lot of time to get fixed up, among a whole bunch of other side-projects.  This is just one of many of those side-projects.  I am giving this site a higher priority than the other sites I maintain, but PLEASE don't send me emails why I haven't gotten around to putting something in.  Everything is looked at and updated accordingly.  I think I've done a pretty good job so far keeping things moving right along, so let me continue to maintain things at my own pace.  Thanks in advance for your consideration. - Jim

<H3>1/28/1998</H3>
The battle continues!  Many people have mailed in to me siting possible updates to the <A HREF="images\federation\tacticalcruiser_prometheus.jpg"><I>U.S.S. Prometheus</I></A>, to assist in its accurization; some suggestions I have taken into account and altered the design accordingly.  Since it is the newest official ship to-date, I will examine each idea on how to improve on the existing design, until an official source (book, CD, person, or otherwise) can concur or negate said changes.  A lot of buzz has been generated on this one, and I'd like to get it as accurate as possible.  Thanks to all those who have contributed to the continuing improvement of the site.  I'm currently getting on the average of ten emails per day (the record so far being thirteen).  Keep it coming!

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>1/25/1998</H3>
Added the <I><A HREF="images\federation\tacticalcruiser_prometheus.jpg">U.S.S. Prometheus</A></I> today, along with a few other ships to the Federation database.
<P>
<A NAME="melbourne"></A>
<B>In other news:</B> I have some info from Marcus C. Nee on a previously unidentified <I>Nebula</I>-esque Tactical Cruiser variant (the <I><A HREF="images\federation\tacticalcruiser_melbourne.jpg">U.S.S. Melbourne</A></I>), as seen in the TNG episode "Future Imperfect".  Marcus writes:
<PRE>That design was the Nebula class starship in its original form as built by Ed Miarecki
using parts from ERTL's 1/1400 and 1/2500 scale Enterprise D model kits. At least two
different models were built. One was the desktop model seen in "Future Imperfect" and the
other was the wreckage of USS Melbourne, NCC-62043 seen in "Best of Both Worlds". Ed showed
me photos of the Melbourne model and it is indeed the same design, with the little
nacelles on top. However, the name and registry are no longer official since USS Melbourne
was redefined to be an Excelsior class ship in the DS9 pilot.

The current Nebula class was a modification of that design. When the large filming
miniature of the Nebula class was built for "The Wounded", Sternbach and Okuda had replaced
the small nacelles with the AWACS dish and repositioned the secondary hull. Later, it was
modified again with the wedge array replacing the AWACS dish.
</PRE>
Keeping this information in mind, I'm now changing the unknown tactical cruiser to be the <I>U.S.S. Melbourne</I>.  Even though the name is unofficial, the design is, so I will keep it official for now, until a new name can be obtained for this ship.  Thanks, Marcus.
<P>
I have also added a few new sites to the <A HREF="links.html">Associated Links</A> Section.

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>1/19/1998</H3>
Whew!  Had a minor crisis there for a little bit.  I received a few emails saying that a bunch of the Klingon ship images were corrupt.  Lo and behold, they were!  As it turns out, the server that this page is running on had a problem with its Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), causing a spike on the system, frying some data on a certain part of the disk.  Lucky me - that's where most of the Klingon designs were stored, along with a few of the newer and updated Federation and Alternate Universe designs.  I think I have it under control - I rebuilt the entire Klingon section, and replaced select Fed files - we should be up and running now.  If anyone finds any more corrupted images that I might have missed, please <A HREF="mailto:jstevens@patriot.net">notify me</A> with the name of the file(s) in question.  Thanks in advance for any help in this.  But we are now up again - 4 days ahead of schedule!

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>1/18/1998</H3>
Schematics site goes down temporarily for maintenance and investigation of corrupted image files at the server level.

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>1/12/1998</H3>
It has come to my attention that there has been some confusion over what exactly is in this database, and what makes an appropriate string to search on in the Federation section.  I have added some information on these questions in the <A HREF="faq.html#search">FAQ</A>.  Check it out, and hopefully there will be no further problems.

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>1/11/1998</H3>
The Borg are now in place in the <A HREF="cgi-bin\others.cgi.html">Other Races</A> section!
<P>
Also added a few more Federation & Klingon ships, including yet a few more unknown ones (all Klingon).  All but one of these unknown designs come from "The U.S.S. Enterprise Officer's Manual", a grey/white/red-looking fan-published book, which had some good stuff on the early series, including the first-ever known printing of the "Klinzhai"-variant of the Klingon Language.  The second unknown Destroyer is a design by Mateen Greenway.  Any idea on the names/numbers for these ships?  Please <A HREF="mailto:jstevens@patriot.net">Email me</A> if you have any info regarding these ships.  ...Y'know....it's funny - I feel like I'm starting to sound like a huge galactic milk carton showing pictures of unknown ships on the side..."Have you seen me?" :-)

Happy New Year all!  Lots of good new stuff in the site.  I've been working for the past couple of weeks (during my holiday break) to build the new <A HREF="klingon.html">Klingon Section</A>, and now it's finally done!  You might notice a significant change on the main page as well: I've consolidated all the "minor" races (including Alternate Universes) into an all-encompassing <A HREF="cgi-bin\others.cgi.html">"Other Races"</A> page.  Since there aren't many designs for any of the races, other than the Federation, Klingons and Romulans, I didn't see the need to dedicate individual pages to them.  It got a little too cluttered.  The first thing you see when you get in there will be the Alternate Universe vessels, that I've always had in my list.  I've also added the <A HREF="images\maquis\raider_maquis.jpg">Maquis Raider</A> to the Maquis section further down.
<P>
In other news, this site has recently been added to various search engines, such as <A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">Alta Vista</A>, <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.infoseek.com/">InfoSeek</A>.
<P>
Well...that's it for now.  Got a few more Fed and Klingon designs to work on, then I'm going to start kicking in with Romulan designs.  Until next time...

<P><HR WIDTH=20%><P>

<H3>12/29/97</H3>
Rebuilt the <A HREF="cgi-bin\bibliography.cgi.html">General Bibliography</A> so that it appears in some semblance of order.
<P>
Updated the <A HREF="images\federation\scout_yeager.jpg"><I>Yeager</I></A>-class scout to include a third warp nacelle to make it more accurate to the actual miniature (thanks, Adam).
<P>
Added a few more new ships.
<P>
<B>HELP!</B> I've got three new "Unknown" designs included in the database (shown in the table below).  They were all found at the <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/Griffworks/UFP.html">Griffworks Shipyard</A> site as photo-studies of models shown at a convention somewhere.  Any idea on names/numbers?  <A HREF="maito.html"jstevens@patriot.net">Drop me a line</A> if you happen to know the background on these ships.  Thanks -JMS

Updated the <A HREF="faq.html">F.A.Q.</A> to include information about what makes an "official" design (straight from the mouth of the <I>Great Bird of the Galaxy</I> himself, Gene Roddenberry), whether or not these schematics are in scale with each other, and if I plan on including schematics from other genres.
<P>
Began work on Klingon and Maquis sections of this site.
<P>
Added new <A HREF="links.html">Associated Links</A> section for the various internet-related sources that were instrumental in the construction of this site and its database.
<P>
Updated some ships to accommodate a higher level of accuracy.
<P>
Added new entries for Federation ships including the official design for the <I><A HREF="images\federation\scout_yeager.jpg">Yeager</A></I>-class Scout.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> The <I>Yeager</I>-class Scout is considered official, as it can be seen occasionally orbiting <I>Deep Space Nine</I>.  Not much is known about this one, other than its mere existence.  We assume that it appeared sometime during <I>DS9</I>'s late fourth season through fifth season, as that was when <I>Star Trek: Voyager</I> went on the air, since the <I>Yeager</I> appears to be made up of components from both <I><A HREF="images\federation\galexploration_voyager.jpg">USS Voyager</A></I> and the <I><A HREF="images\maquis\raider_maquis.jpg">Maquis Raider</A></I>.
<P>
<B>ALSO NEW:</B> Help me out with this one in the table below!  This is a ship design that was originally designed and built by Ed Miarecki, Rick Sternbach, and Mike Okuda, as a study model for a variant of the <I>Nebula</I>-class Tactical Cruiser.  It made its first appearance on "Captain" Riker's ready-room desk in the <I>Star Trek: The Next Generation</I> episode "Future Imperfect".  Anyone know name/registry number?  <A HREF="mailto:jstevens@patriot.net">Email me</A> if you do.  Thanks - JMS

Added two new "official" ships: The <A HREF="images\federation\frigate_centaur.jpg"><I>U.S.S. Centaur</I></A> frigate, and the <A HREF="images\federation\thrudeckcarrier_shelley.jpg"><I>U.S.S. Shelley</I></A> thru-deck carrier from the <I>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</I> Season VI premiere "A Time to Stand".
