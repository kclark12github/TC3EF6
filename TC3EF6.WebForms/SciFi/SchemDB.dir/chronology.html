Looks like I was struck by a Y2K bug of my own (very embarrassing).  The hit counter on the main page read "100" instead of "2000" (weird).  I downloaded the latest version of the hit counter I was using (2.5), which promptly fixed the problem.  If anyone is interested in obtaining source code for this hit counter, it can be found on the author's web page at <A HREF="mailto:ma_muquit@fccc.edu">Muhammad A Muquit's</A> <A HREF="http://www.fccc.edu/users/muquit/Count.html">WWW Homepage Access Counter and Clock</A>.

Added the new <A HREF="bsg\index.html">Battlestar Galactica</A> section!!  Now you all know what I've been so busy doing that I didn't have time to answer all your emails asking for updates!
<P>
Also added the new official list of "Other Miscellaneous and Non-Aligned Races/Organizations".  Check the Star Trek section's <A HREF="startrek\chronology.html">Chronology</A> for details.

We have returned!  Thanks to all the users out there who have dropped me
messages of support.  It's been a long 8 months, but we're finally back up
and running.  No, I wasn't shut down by Paramount, so let's just stop that
little rumor in its path.  It was simply a matter of not having a home for
a server anymore.  I am now teamed up with Kurt Roithinger and Allyson M.
W. Dyar of <A HREF="http://www.ssnexus.org/">Space Station Nexus</A> fame
on out in Oregon and Washington State, who provided me with a Pennsylvania-based server (yes, we do get around in this business).  A special tip-o-de-hat to them for providing me
with a long-sought-after home for my site.  Now, down to business...
<P>
I'm sure you've noticed the slight change in format with the front page.
I've added place holders for the three other genres I intend to add
schematics for.  As I have an eight-month backlog of designs, I'm still
compiling those together.  I just wanted to get the site back up for the
time being with some new graphics to inform people that some new stuff was
coming down the pipe.  The Trek-related stuff, as a result, has shifted
down by one level.  All the things that were there still are, soon to be
adding some more.  Another thing you may notice is the split-up of the
Chronology and F.A.Q. sections.  Since I have
questions/answers/chronological milestones which are pertinent to only one
section, I'm going to place these items of interest in their respective
sessions.  Any ground-shaking all-applying events worthy of the Chronology
or F.A.Q. will be located in said sections, at the highest level of the
website.  Pretty simple?  I'd like to think so.  Links, bibliographies, and
Webrings will also be
specific to sections, separating between Trek, Galactica, B5 and Yamato
references, etc.  References, Reviews & Awards will be located only
at the highest level, applying to the overall database in general.
<P>
So, that's pretty much it for now.  I'm going back to continue compiling
files.  The next big step after bringing in new Trek starship designs, is
building the Galactica section (possibly one of the best concepts ever applied
for a television series next to
Star Trek, the Prisoner, and Nowhere Man), so keep watching and take care...
