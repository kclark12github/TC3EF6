"Kolchak: The Night Stalker" Episode Guide






Kolchak really isn't a pure horror show, although it deals with man-killing monsters and creatures every week. The simple fact is you can't do a legitimate "horror show" on network time, as the sponsors don't want to scare people out of their pants. So we decided to titillate, not terrify, to have fun with it.

THE RIPPER
Guest Cast: Beatrice Colan, Ruth McDevittWriter: Rudolph BorchertDirector: Allen Baron


Jack the Ripper is alive and well and knocking 'em dead in Chicago. The original Jack the Ripper, still alive and killing, finds his way to Chicago to begin his rampage again. Carl locates him on the advice from a nosey neighbor ( played by Ruth McDevitt, who would subsequently join the regular cast as Miss. Emily Cowles). He tracks the Ripper to his lair, and the carnage is brought to a shocking conclusion. 









THE ZOMBIE
Guest Cast: Joe Sirola, Charles Aidman, Val Bisoglio, Earl Faison, Antonio Fargas, Pat J. O'Malley, Scatman Crothers, John FiedlerWriter: Zekial MarkelDirector: Alex Grasshoff


Carl gets involved in voodoo politics as the Chicago mob is slowly being picked off by a towering black zombie. From the boardrooms organized crime, to the dark mystery of Hatian magic in present day Chicago, Carl unwinds the story that brings him face to face with the walking dead. 









U.F.O.(aka: They Have Been They Are They Will Be)
Guest Cast: James Gregory, Mary Wickes, Dick Van Patten,Maureen Arthur, John Fiedler, Phil Leeds, Fritz Feld, Rudy Challenger, Carol AnnesusiWriter: Rudolph BorchertDirector: Allen Baron


The truth is really "out there" when Carl investigates the death of several animals in the zoo who have had all the bone marrow sucked out of them. Dodging piles of tar-like goo, and invisible menaces in the planetarium, he comes face-to-shiny-exterior with the killer's spaceship. 









THE VAMPIRE
Guest Cast: William Daniels, Jan Murray, Kathleen Nolan, Suzanne Charny, John Douchette, Jan Murray, Larry Storch, Milt Kamen Writer: David ChaseDirector: Don Weiss


This is one of my favorite episodes. Contrary to the current trend, the "Night Stalker"'s vampires are only ever portrayed as superficially attractive - so the sexual subtext of vampirism becomes subtextual again. This is a sequel to the pilot, featuring one of the "survivors" of the vampire in Las Vegas. Carl ends up in sunny Los Angeles, stalking a beautiful prostitute-turned-vampire. This episode features the most spectacular final confrontation of the entire series.









THE WEREWOLF
Guest Cast: Eric Breadan, Henry Jones, Bob Hastings, Dick Gautier, Nita Talbot, Jackie Russell, Lewis Charles, Barry Cahill, Dort Clark, Heath Jobes, Jim Hawkins Writers: David Chase, Paul PlaydonDirector: Don Weiss


One of the weaker episodes finds Carl escaping the frigid winter in Chicago for the idyllic pleasures of a cruise - only to have his sojourn shattered by the emergence of a werewolf amongst the passengers. Not very effective, particularly in showing way too much of the werewolf, who just looks like a guy with a dirty face. 









FIRE-FALL
Guest Cast: Fred Beir, Philip Carey, Madlyn Rhue, Writer: Bill S. BallingerDirector: Don Weiss


A famous pianist is tormented by his dopplganger, a diabolical alter ego with a penchant for flames. Not one of the strongest stories, it finds Carl turning to the Church for help. Sometimes bundled with "The Energy Eaters" as a movie entitled "Crackle of Death". 









THE DEVIL'S PLATFORM
Guest Cast: Tom Skerritt, Ellen Weston, Julie Gregg, John Myhers, Jeanne Cooper, Bill Mims, Stanley Adams, Robert Do QuiWriter: Donn MullallyDirector: Allen Baron


The strangest bedfellows in politics: a young Tom Skerrit, and Satan (we won't get into the fact that Satan's been in politics from the beginning). Skerrit sells his soul for political advancement, and the power to transform into a Devil Dog (handy for hounding his competition). 

BAD MEDICINE
Guest Cast: Richard Kiel, Ramon Bieri, Alice Ghostley, Victor Jory, David Lewis, Marvin Kaplan, James Griffith, Dennis McCarthy, Morris Buchanan, Kieth Walker, Madilyn ClarkWriter: L. Ford NealeDirector: Alex Grasshoff


An ancient Native American spirit stalks the rich of Chicago in the forms of a variety of animals. He is cursed to try and rebuild the treasure stolen from the Gods, and his only weakness is in the eye of the beholder. This marks the first appearance of Richard Kiel as a monster on this show - see also: The Spanish Moss Murders. 









THE SPANISH MOSS MURDERS
Guest Cast: Keenan Wynn, Severn Darden, Randy Boone, Richard Kiel, Johnny Silver, Ned Glass, Virgina Greg, Brian Avery, Maurice Marsag, Elisabeth Brooks, Donald MantoothWriter: Al FriedmanDirector: Gordon Hessler


So long Joe, me got go, me'o my'o - sunuvagun we have big Swamp Monsters on the bayou. A swamp monster emerges from the mind of a dreamer in a sleep experiment. It stalks the streets of Chicago, leaving a trail of wet moss, and bodies in it's wake. Carl takes to the sewers to track a creature that doesn't really exist. Once again, it's Richard Kiel doing duty under all that moss. 









THE ENERGY EATER
Guest Cast: William Smith, Michael Strong, John AlvinWriters: Arthur Rowe, Rudolph BorchertDirector: Alex Grasshoff


Another Native American legend stalks Chicago - only this one was here first. Construction of a new hospital wakens a great Bear Spirit that kills with electricity. Unusual episode in that Carl has the cooperation of the authorities in seeking the monster's weakness. Sometimes bundled with "Fire Fall" as a movie entitled "Crackle of Death". 









HORROR IN THE HEIGHTS
Guest Cast: Phil SilversWriter: Jimmy SangsterDirector: Michael T. Caffey


Still one of the best, namely for the good writing, and the cast filled with old Jewish character actors. A Rakshasha, a flesh eating demon from Hindu legend, preys upon the elderly in Chicago's Jewish ghetto, taking on the form of the person his victim trusts most. 









MR. R.I.N.G.
Guest Cast: Julie Adams, Corrine MichaelsWriter: L. Ford NealeDirector: Gene Levitt


A very clever (if somewhat chubby) android escapes from a research institute. Wearing a wax face, this misunderstood 70's Frankenstein monster wanders the streets of Chicago leaving a trail of corpses in his wake.









THE PRIMAL SCREAM
Guest Cast: Pat Harrinq ton, Katherine Woodville, Lindsay WorkmanWriters: Bill S. Ballinger, David ChaseDirector: Robert Scherer


The missing link is missing no more! An oil company drilling in the arctic uncovers million year-old cells that rapidly reproduce back in the lab in Chicago. An ape-man at large in the asphalt jungle leads Carl a merry chase. 









THE TREVI COLLECTION
Guest Cast: Nina Foch, Lara ParkerWriter: Rudolph BorchertDirector: Don Weiss


Carl is caught between the Garment District mob, and a beautiful witch when he investigates the death of a fashion spy. Things heat up when Carl is faced with an army of satanic mannequins. 









CHOPPER
Guest Cast: Larry Linville, Jim Backus, Sharon FarrellWriters: Steve Fisher, David ChaseDirector: Bruce Kessler


"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" meets "The Wild Ones" as the headless spirit of "the Swordman", a biker, picks off former members of a rival gang. Larry Linville - Frank Burns from TV's "M*A*S*H" - stars as the police lieutenant. 









DEMON IN LACE
Guest Cast: Andrew Prine, Keenan WynnWriters: Stephen Lord, David ChaseDirector: Michael Kozoll


While translating an ancient tablet an arachaeology professor unwittingly summons a succubus (a female demon). Hopping into recently deceased young women around campus, the demon lures young men to their doom. Sometimes patched together with "Legacy of Te rror" as a movie called "The Demon and the Mummy". 









LEGACY OF TERROR
Guest Cast: Ramon Bieri, Pippa Scott, Sorrell Booke, Victor Campos, Erik EstradaWriter: Arthur RoweDirector: Don McDougall


Carl comes face to face with a centuries-old Aztec mummy at the ballpark, following a series of brutal murders wherein the victim's heart has been removed. Notable for the appearance of a young Erik (C.Hi.Ps) Estrada as a rich wastrel (thank you Scott Sundstrom for reminding me). Sometimes patched together with "Demon In Lace" as a movie called "The Demon and the Mummy". 









THE KNIGHTLY MURDERS
Guest Cast: John Dehner, Hans Conried, Robert Emhart, Jeff DonnellWriters: Michael Kozoll, David ChaseDirector: Vincent McEveety


The haunted armor of a necromatic 12th century knight crashes the party when promoters try to turn the musem where he is on exhibit into a nightclub. Carl decides he has to go, and becomes the ax-man for the job. Hans Conried is a hoot as the disgruntled curator. 









THE YOUTH KILLER
Guest Cast: Cathy Lee Crosby, Dwayne HickmanWriter: Rudolph BorchertDirector: Don McDougall


Dating service from Hell? The cream of the singles scene are dying off - from old age. A beautiful devotee of an ancient Greek goddess has been trading their youth to improve her complection. What's Carl going to do now that he has the Gods mad at him? 

THE SENTRY
Guest Cast: Kathie Brown, Tom BosleyWriters: L. Ford Neale, John HuffDirector: Seymour Robbie


In a rehash of the "Devil in the Dark" episode of "Star Trek", workers at a high security underground complex are being killed off by a large bi-pedal lizard when construction disturbs her eggs.
